# TextMining
This is the repository for a text-generating program.  It searches Twitter for a certain keyword, then generates strings of words based off of the collected data using Markov analysis.
gather.py performs the text gathering, and creates a text file with the data, while memes.py performs the markov analysis and text generation.
The twitch-bot directory was for analyzing twitch chat data and creating auto-generated twitch chat messages, but has not been implemented as of yet.
