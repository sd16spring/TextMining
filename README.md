# TextMining
This is the base repo for the text mining and analysis project for Software Design, Spring 2016 at Olin College.

In this mini project, I made a Tupac lyric generator.  This project was done in three stages.  First, I used beautifulsoup to scrape lyrics off the web.  Second, I used python parse the text and make a dataset.  Third, I used the dataset, python, and markov chains to generate lyrics.

The order of running files:

getLinks.py

getLyrics.py

assembleDataset.py

generateText.py
