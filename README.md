# TextMining
This code filters a robin williams stand up special and returns the average sentimentality of the performance along with an ordered list of the most commonly used words. Also, I decided not to do 
doctests because all of the functions depend on globalvariables. For this reason, there would be only one possible output, and it would be clear whether it was working or not by testing as I go.
This was my best judgement, but let me know if I should have done something differently.
