aS'I guess its to much to expect these people to realize that, doing something \nlike a girl is based on the knowledge that masculinity (males) don\'t want \nto be feminine (female). This works the same the other way around too. \nPhysical prowess is predominantly a male trait, as evolution has designed \nus to be. This isn\'t because of the patriarchy, the lives and purpose of \nhuman males (or at least recently enough ago in history) requires more \nstrength than females. So doing something athletic "like a girl" is \nactually somewhat of a valid insult for men. "like a girl" has nothing to \ndo with how hard you are trying to do something, as this commercial seems \nto think. its the level of ability. If i told you, women, you expressed a \nmasculine trait, like you looked like a man, or you smell like a man, \nwouldn\'t you be offended? Probably, but you wouldn\'t think its oppression. \nBecause both of those things are actually insulting. The trick is \nunderstanding that "like a girl" is in the same boat.'

aS'I guess, if you are a Christian, it is like having one foot in the world, \nand the other not. If you experience worldly desires, the spirit of \nantichrist, which is in the world, has access to your thoughts, maybe. \nHence, the sale on Hagen-Dasz ice cream, and not a moment too soon. The \nworld tempting you to remain, a glutton?Or did the Lord send an Angel to \nreprogram the grocery store\'s computer to read a lower price for you? - \nCloud Computing? (Hypothesis : After they ate of the forbidden fruit, \ntemptation abounded in the world, sin having hacked into their flesh - \ntheir eyes, opened, their monitor, view-screen, hi-jacked...What is really \nthere, if not what you see?..(Soo beautiful. So hot.) Having rejected \nChristianity, does the devil need to tempt they who dwell in darkness? For \nthey who have not Light, are doomed, whether they experience much \ntemptation in the flesh, or not : It\'s a theory, to explain economic \ndifferences, between nation-states. Hence, worldly pleasures, temptations, \nabound in Christian countries - so that they might remain, or return to.. \nIn contrast, the Haitians who will not kick the voodoo habit, seem destined \nfor a life of poverty and damnation eternal. And if they receive earthly \nriches, it is yet of the devil, to convince the other Haitians - see, this \nVooDoo stuff works! And if you sacrifice your firstborn, you too might \nreceive a Kawasaki motorcycle..) But being a Christian, you have received \nthe Spirit of Christ, and so are now different from them who have not the \nHoly Spirit. And if you keep your desires spiritual, and not carnal, you \nwill not experience physical hunger, or physical thirst. See, Galations 5:24, \nkjv. Now many are weak, but his strength is perfected in weakness. \nTraining, like an athlete, to be better, holier - so that you might receive \nmore of His Spirit. New wine, for a new bottle, and a new bottle for a new \nwine?The one, "the new you", has a future, the other not : Be ye therefore, \nspiritually-minded, as much as you can. For the Spirit quickens.Hence, \nstore up treasure in Heaven rather. Although it is kind of nice to have \ntreasure in both places, on earth and in Heaven above - like Trump\'s \nManhattan Office, full of knick-knacks and memorabillia, while he himself \n"lives upstairs"...Moderation? More like leaning.. keeping things in \nperspective. To wit, greed, is not a word which appears in the Bible, kjv. \nLyrics : "Let\'s go surf\'n now, everybody\'s learning how, come\'on a surf\'n \nsafari with me." Faith and love, is a balancing act.'

I understand what you \nare attempting to communicate, you think that every other race is \nattempting to extinct white people because they feel like it. What benefit \nwill they obtain from that. "So we eradicated whites guys. Good job." "what \nnow boss?" "Well, how about we teach those Asians we mean business". \nAnti-racist means against the racist bullshit you\'re pulling off here, not \nfor the destruction of the white race.'

It didn\'t bother me till i was in the age where i already have an \nidea whats happening. Though we were dressed and just scrubbing our bodies \n( no kissing ) i felt disturbed and disgusted by the thought. We\'ve been \nparted since we were 6 and when we met again as adults we cant look at each \nother straight.

p641
aS"+Richard Langford Dude, not everyone believes as you do, and you as a human \ndo not have a right to enforce your standards and beliefs on others. Jesus \nhimself even said, Judge ye not, for the amount that ye judge, ye will also \nbe condemned. Let people live how they wish so long as they do not exploit \nothers. That's what Jesus stood for, and that's what I personally try to \nemulate in my own life. It was fallible human beings who wrote the laws in \nthe books, not G-d. Even Biblical scholars in the Vatican agree to this. So \nthe Law is not eternal, it is ever changing as the world grows. And since \nthe world grew a free open separation of Church and State in this country, \nthis law does not have the right to pass because it is purely a religiously \nmotivated goal. Preach on Christian videos if you wish, but leave us free \nthinkers alone."
p642
aS'I ask you this What does the Creator think of this? '
p643
aS"Richard, I hope one day something opens your eyes. Maybe this will, even if \njust a little bit. Did you know that in the earlier versions of the Bible \nthere were CERO, I repeat, CERO references about homosexuals? And that's \nnot because there weren't any, because there has always been. No, it wasn't \nbecause of that, it was because they didn't give a shit about it. Jesus \ncertainly didn't see it wrong, otherwise he would have spoken against it."

aS'+Richard Langford No modern State should take its decisions according to \nreligion. Your argument could hold in a theocracy like Szaudi Arabia or \nIran, but would be unacceptable in any democratic Parliament.'
p648
aS"+Richard Langford A happy person, who is living his life to the fullest and \ngiving love whenever he goes would never say the words you say. You think \nnobody can see how scared you are? How unhappy you are? You think if you \ncan compare yourself to others and find yourself better it will make you \nhappy? Or you will go to heaven and be happy there? The saddest person is a \nperson like you - the one who is afraid to work on himself, to give love \nfreely to EVERYONE. You are not God, you are not Jesus, and you are not \nHoly Spirit Junior. If you are so full of energy go adopt a cat or a dog, \ngo help in a shelter, go read to a lonely elderly person. Go do something \nGOOD, because your blah blah won't stop evil, only good deads will. But of \ncourse it is harder than trashing someone's loving son on the Internet."
p649
aS"+Richard Langford I don't think you have any say in what goes to hell or \nheaven. And I also recall God's first and most important law to be about \nloving one another. And I also recall him saying he does not need your help \nis declaring someone saint and someone sinner, if anyone does live against \nGod's laws God will speak to THEM, not you."
p650
aS'+Richard Langford of course there is.....that is why he sacrificed Jesus. \nHe died for our sins. "God so loved the world that he gave his one and only \nson." To this day God loves us even though we sin.'
p651
aS'Denise read the bible there are many times God shows his wrath.'
p652
aS"You do realize that people sin everyday, and it seems to go unnoticed. \nEveryday people have pre-marital sex, get tattoos, drink excessively, have \naffairs, lie, cheat, steal, why is everyone so focused on this 1 sin? In my \nopinion, that's how life was back then, but as a society we have come so \nfar and with Christians like you holding us back is selfish. I am also a \nChristian and I go to church every Sunday. I also happen to teach Sunday \nschool, I am an AWANA leader, and I help out at VBS. We try to teach that \nGod is a loving God who is caring and merciful. Why would anyone want to \nworship a God who is full of hate? Love one another and care for each \nother, that is a true Christian."

aS'+Richard Langford "It\'s evil because the magical sky wizard says so and \nalso because cavemen were afraid of anything different."\n\nGood argument there buddy.

p657
aS"+Richard Langford That's *your* religion. There are many people in this \ncountry. Many of them believe in some other religion, or no religion at \nall. Many of them believe you're wrong. As it happens, I think that you are \nindeed wrong, but that's not relevant here. What's relevant is this: who \nare you to use the power of the state to impose your religion on me? How \nwould you like it if other people imposed their religious views on you? We \nhave to base our common laws on a common sense understanding of reality. We \ncannot base them on a narrowly sectarian understanding. We couldn't even if \nthat understanding was correct, for how on earth are you going to design a \nsystem of government capable of picking out the right one?"
