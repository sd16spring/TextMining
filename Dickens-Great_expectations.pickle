So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.\r\n\r\nI give Pirrip as my father\'s family name, on the authority of his\r\ntombstone and my sister,--Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.\r\nAs I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness\r\nof either of them (for their days were long before the days of\r\nphotographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were\r\nunreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on\r\nmy father\'s, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man,\r\nwith curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription,\r\n"Also Georgiana Wife of the Above," I drew a childish conclusion that\r\nmy mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each\r\nabout a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside\r\ntheir grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of\r\nmine,--who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in\r\nthat universal struggle,--I am indebted for a belief I religiously\r\nentertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands\r\nin their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nOurs was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river\r\nwound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression\r\nof the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable\r\nraw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain\r\nthat this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and\r\nthat Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the\r\nabove, were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham,\r\nTobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead\r\nand buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard,\r\nintersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle\r\nfeeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond\r\nwas the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was\r\nrushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid\r\nof it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.\r\n\r\n"Hold your noise!" cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from\r\namong the graves at the side of the church porch. "Keep still, you\r\nlittle devil, or I\'ll cut your throat!"\r\n\r\nA fearful man, all in coarse gray, with a great iron on his leg. A man\r\nwith no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his\r\nhead. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and\r\nlamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by\r\nbriars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose\r\nteeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Don\'t cut my throat, sir," I pleaded in terror. "Pray don\'t do it,\r\nsir."\r\n\r\n"Tell us your name!" said the man. "Quick!"\r\n\r\n"Pip, sir."\r\n\r\n"Once more," said the man, staring at me. "Give it mouth!"\r\n\r\n"Pip. Pip, sir."\r\n\r\n"Show us where you live," said the man. "Pint out the place!"\r\n\r\nI pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the\r\nalder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.\r\n\r\nThe man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and\r\nemptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread. When\r\nthe church came to itself,--for he was so sudden and strong that he\r\nmade it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my\r\nfeet,--when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high\r\ntombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.\r\n\r\n"You young dog," said the man, licking his lips, "what fat cheeks you\r\nha\' got."\r\n\r\nI believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my\r\nyears, and not strong.\r\n\r\n"Darn me if I couldn\'t eat em," said the man, with a threatening shake\r\nof his head, "and if I han\'t half a mind to\'t!"\r\n\r\nI earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn\'t, and held tighter to\r\nthe tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it;\r\npartly, to keep myself from crying.\r\n\r\n"Now lookee here!" said the man. "Where\'s your mother?"\r\n\r\n"There, sir!" said I.\r\n\r\nHe started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"There, sir!" I timidly explained. "Also Georgiana. That\'s my mother."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said he, coming back. "And is that your father alonger your\r\nmother?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said I; "him too; late of this parish."\r\n\r\n"Ha!" he muttered then, considering. "Who d\'ye live with,--supposin\'\r\nyou\'re kindly let to live, which I han\'t made up my mind about?"\r\n\r\n"My sister, sir,--Mrs. Joe Gargery,--wife of Joe Gargery, the\r\nblacksmith, sir."\r\n\r\n"Blacksmith, eh?" said he. And looked down at his leg.\r\n\r\nAfter darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer\r\nto my tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he\r\ncould hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine,\r\nand mine looked most helplessly up into his.\r\n\r\n"Now lookee here," he said, "the question being whether you\'re to be let\r\nto live. You know what a file is?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"And you know what wittles is?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\nAfter each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a\r\ngreater sense of helplessness and danger.\r\n\r\n"You get me a file." He tilted me again. "And you get me wittles." He\r\ntilted me again. "You bring \'em both to me." He tilted me again. "Or\r\nI\'ll have your heart and liver out." He tilted me again.\r\n\r\nI was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both\r\nhands, and said, "If you would kindly please to let me keep upright,\r\nsir, perhaps I shouldn\'t be sick, and perhaps I could attend more."\r\n\r\nHe gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped\r\nover its own weathercock. Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright\r\nposition on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:--\r\n\r\n"You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You\r\nbring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and you\r\nnever dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having\r\nseen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall be let to\r\nlive. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no matter how\r\nsmall it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore out, roasted,\r\nand ate. Now, I ain\'t alone, as you may think I am. There\'s a young man\r\nhid with me, in comparison with which young man I am a Angel. That young\r\nman hears the words I speak. That young man has a secret way pecooliar\r\nto himself, of getting at a boy, and at his heart, and at his liver. It\r\nis in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man. A\r\nboy may lock his door, may be warm in bed, may tuck himself up, may draw\r\nthe clothes over his head, may think himself comfortable and safe, but\r\nthat young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him\r\nopen. I am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present\r\nmoment, with great difficulty. I find it wery hard to hold that young\r\nman off of your inside. Now, what do you say?"\r\n\r\nI said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken\r\nbits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\n"Say Lord strike you dead if you don\'t!" said the man.\r\n\r\nI said so, and he took me down.\r\n\r\n"Now," he pursued, "you remember what you\'ve undertook, and you remember\r\nthat young man, and you get home!"\r\n\r\n"Goo-good night, sir," I faltered.\r\n\r\n"Much of that!" said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat. "I\r\nwish I was a frog. Or a eel!"\r\n\r\nAt the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his\r\narms,--clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,--and limped\r\ntowards the low church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among the\r\nnettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked\r\nin my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people,\r\nstretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his\r\nankle and pull him in.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose\r\nlegs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. When I\r\nsaw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of\r\nmy legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on\r\nagain towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and picking\r\nhis way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the\r\nmarshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were heavy or\r\nthe tide was in.\r\n\r\nThe marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped\r\nto look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, not\r\nnearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long\r\nangry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of the\r\nriver I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the\r\nprospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the beacon\r\nby which the sailors steered,--like an unhooped cask upon a pole,--an\r\nugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with some chains\r\nhanging to it which had once held a pirate. The man was limping on\r\ntowards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life, and come\r\ndown, and going back to hook himself up again. It gave me a terrible\r\nturn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their heads to\r\ngaze after him, I wondered whether they thought so too. I looked all\r\nround for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of him. But now\r\nI was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\nMy sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I,\r\nand had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors\r\nbecause she had brought me up "by hand." Having at that time to find out\r\nfor myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a hard and\r\nheavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as\r\nwell as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up\r\nby hand.\r\n\r\nShe was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general\r\nimpression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand. Joe\r\nwas a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth\r\nface, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed\r\nto have somehow got mixed with their own whites. He was a mild,\r\ngood-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,--a sort\r\nof Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.\r\n\r\nMy sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing\r\nredness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible\r\nshe washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She was tall\r\nand bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her\r\nfigure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in\r\nfront, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She made it a powerful\r\nmerit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this\r\napron so much. Though I really see no reason why she should have worn it\r\nat all; or why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have taken it\r\noff, every day of her life.\r\n\r\nJoe\'s forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of the\r\ndwellings in our country were,--most of them, at that time. When I ran\r\nhome from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was sitting\r\nalone in the kitchen. Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, and having\r\nconfidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment I\r\nraised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it,\r\nsitting in the chimney corner.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And she\'s\r\nout now, making it a baker\'s dozen."\r\n\r\n"Is she?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Pip," said Joe; "and what\'s worse, she\'s got Tickler with her."\r\n\r\nAt this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat\r\nround and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler\r\nwas a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled\r\nframe.\r\n\r\n"She sot down," said Joe, "and she got up, and she made a grab at\r\nTickler, and she Ram-paged out. That\'s what she did," said Joe, slowly\r\nclearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at\r\nit; "she Ram-paged out, Pip."\r\n\r\n"Has she been gone long, Joe?" I always treated him as a larger species\r\nof child, and as no more than my equal.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, "she\'s been on the\r\nRam-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. She\'s a coming! Get\r\nbehind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you."\r\n\r\nI took the advice. My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open,\r\nand finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause, and\r\napplied Tickler to its further investigation. She concluded by throwing\r\nme--I often served as a connubial missile--at Joe, who, glad to get hold\r\nof me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me\r\nup there with his great leg.\r\n\r\n"Where have you been, you young monkey?" said Mrs. Joe, stamping her\r\nfoot. "Tell me directly what you\'ve been doing to wear me away with fret\r\nand fright and worrit, or I\'d have you out of that corner if you was\r\nfifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys."\r\n\r\n"I have only been to the churchyard," said I, from my stool, crying and\r\nrubbing myself.\r\n\r\n"Churchyard!" repeated my sister. "If it warn\'t for me you\'d have been\r\nto the churchyard long ago, and stayed there. Who brought you up by\r\nhand?"\r\n\r\n"You did," said I.\r\n\r\n"And why did I do it, I should like to know?" exclaimed my sister.\r\n\r\nI whimpered, "I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t!" said my sister. "I\'d never do it again! I know that. I may\r\ntruly say I\'ve never had this apron of mine off since born you were.\r\nIt\'s bad enough to be a blacksmith\'s wife (and him a Gargery) without\r\nbeing your mother."\r\n\r\nMy thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at\r\nthe fire. For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the\r\nmysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I was\r\nunder to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me\r\nin the avenging coals.\r\n\r\n"Hah!" said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station. "Churchyard,\r\nindeed! You may well say churchyard, you two." One of us, by the by, had\r\nnot said it at all. "You\'ll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you, one\r\nof these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you\'d be without me!"\r\n\r\nAs she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me\r\nover his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and\r\ncalculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the\r\ngrievous circumstances foreshadowed. After that, he sat feeling his\r\nright-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with\r\nhis blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.\r\n\r\nMy sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,\r\nthat never varied. First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard\r\nand fast against her bib,--where it sometimes got a pin into it, and\r\nsometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she\r\ntook some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf, in\r\nan apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,--using both\r\nsides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and moulding\r\nthe butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a final smart\r\nwipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very thick round off\r\nthe loaf: which she finally, before separating from the loaf, hewed into\r\ntwo halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my\r\nslice. I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful\r\nacquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew\r\nMrs. Joe\'s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my\r\nlarcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe. Therefore\r\nI resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of my\r\ntrousers.\r\n\r\nThe effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I\r\nfound to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap\r\nfrom the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.\r\nAnd it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In\r\nour already-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his\r\ngood-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare\r\nthe way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each\r\nother\'s admiration now and then,--which stimulated us to new exertions.\r\nTo-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast\r\ndiminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but\r\nhe found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and\r\nmy untouched bread and butter on the other. At last, I desperately\r\nconsidered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it\r\nhad best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the\r\ncircumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at\r\nme, and got my bread and butter down my leg.\r\n\r\nJoe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss\r\nof appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he\r\ndidn\'t seem to enjoy. He turned it about in his mouth much longer than\r\nusual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like\r\na pill. He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on\r\none side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw\r\nthat my bread and butter was gone.\r\n\r\nThe wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold\r\nof his bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister\'s\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter now?" said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.\r\n\r\n"I say, you know!" muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very serious\r\nremonstrance. "Pip, old chap! You\'ll do yourself a mischief. It\'ll stick\r\nsomewhere. You can\'t have chawed it, Pip."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter now?" repeated my sister, more sharply than before.\r\n\r\n"If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I\'d recommend you to do it,"\r\nsaid Joe, all aghast. "Manners is manners, but still your elth\'s your\r\nelth."\r\n\r\nBy this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe,\r\nand, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little while\r\nagainst the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, looking guiltily\r\non.\r\n\r\n"Now, perhaps you\'ll mention what\'s the matter," said my sister, out of\r\nbreath, "you staring great stuck pig."\r\n\r\nJoe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and\r\nlooked at me again.\r\n\r\n"You know, Pip," said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek,\r\nand speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone,\r\n"you and me is always friends, and I\'d be the last to tell upon you,\r\nany time. But such a--" he moved his chair and looked about the floor\r\nbetween us, and then again at me--"such a most oncommon Bolt as that!"\r\n\r\n"Been bolting his food, has he?" cried my sister.\r\n\r\n"You know, old chap," said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe,\r\nwith his bite still in his cheek, "I Bolted, myself, when I was your\r\nage--frequent--and as a boy I\'ve been among a many Bolters; but I never\r\nsee your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it\'s a mercy you ain\'t Bolted\r\ndead."\r\n\r\nMy sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying\r\nnothing more than the awful words, "You come along and be dosed."\r\n\r\nSome medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine\r\nmedicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;\r\nhaving a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At the\r\nbest of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice\r\nrestorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like a new\r\nfence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a\r\npint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater\r\ncomfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would\r\nbe held in a bootjack. Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to\r\nswallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching and\r\nmeditating before the fire), "because he had had a turn." Judging from\r\nmyself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had had\r\nnone before.\r\n\r\nConscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in\r\nthe case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secret\r\nburden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a great\r\npunishment. The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe--I\r\nnever thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the\r\nhousekeeping property as his--united to the necessity of always keeping\r\none hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about\r\nthe kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind. Then,\r\nas the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the\r\nvoice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to\r\nsecrecy, declaring that he couldn\'t and wouldn\'t starve until to-morrow,\r\nbut must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if the young man\r\nwho was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hands in me\r\nshould yield to a constitutional impatience, or should mistake the time,\r\nand should think himself accredited to my heart and liver to-night,\r\ninstead of to-morrow! If ever anybody\'s hair stood on end with terror,\r\nmine must have done so then. But, perhaps, nobody\'s ever did?\r\n\r\nIt was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with\r\na copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it with\r\nthe load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with the\r\nload on HIS leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread\r\nand butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slipped away,\r\nand deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.\r\n\r\n"Hark!" said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final warm\r\nin the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; "was that great guns,\r\nJoe?"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Joe. "There\'s another conwict off."\r\n\r\n"What does that mean, Joe?" said I.\r\n\r\nMrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly,\r\n"Escaped. Escaped." Administering the definition like Tar-water.\r\n\r\nWhile Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put my\r\nmouth into the forms of saying to Joe, "What\'s a convict?" Joe put his\r\nmouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer, that I\r\ncould make out nothing of it but the single word "Pip."\r\n\r\n"There was a conwict off last night," said Joe, aloud, "after\r\nsunset-gun. And they fired warning of him. And now it appears they\'re\r\nfiring warning of another."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s firing?" said I.\r\n\r\n"Drat that boy," interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work,\r\n"what a questioner he is. Ask no questions, and you\'ll be told no lies."\r\n\r\nIt was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should be\r\ntold lies by her even if I did ask questions. But she never was polite\r\nunless there was company.\r\n\r\nAt this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost\r\npains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a word\r\nthat looked to me like "sulks." Therefore, I naturally pointed to Mrs.\r\nJoe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, "her?" But Joe wouldn\'t\r\nhear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide, and shook\r\nthe form of a most emphatic word out of it. But I could make nothing of\r\nthe word.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Joe," said I, as a last resort, "I should like to know--if you\r\nwouldn\'t much mind--where the firing comes from?"\r\n\r\n"Lord bless the boy!" exclaimed my sister, as if she didn\'t quite mean\r\nthat but rather the contrary. "From the Hulks!"\r\n\r\n"Oh-h!" said I, looking at Joe. "Hulks!"\r\n\r\nJoe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, "Well, I told you so."\r\n\r\n"And please, what\'s Hulks?" said I.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way with this boy!" exclaimed my sister, pointing me out\r\nwith her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me. "Answer him one\r\nquestion, and he\'ll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prison-ships,\r\nright \'cross th\' meshes." We always used that name for marshes, in our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n"I wonder who\'s put into prison-ships, and why they\'re put there?" said\r\nI, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.\r\n\r\nIt was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose. "I tell you what,\r\nyoung fellow," said she, "I didn\'t bring you up by hand to badger\r\npeople\'s lives out. It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had.\r\nPeople are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob,\r\nand forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking\r\nquestions. Now, you get along to bed!"\r\n\r\nI was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went upstairs\r\nin the dark, with my head tingling,--from Mrs. Joe\'s thimble\r\nhaving played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words,--I\r\nfelt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were\r\nhandy for me. I was clearly on my way there. I had begun by asking\r\nquestions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.\r\n\r\nSince that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thought\r\nthat few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror.\r\nNo matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror. I was in\r\nmortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was\r\nin mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal\r\nterror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I had\r\nno hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed\r\nme at every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done on\r\nrequirement, in the secrecy of my terror.\r\n\r\nIf I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting\r\ndown the river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly\r\npirate calling out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed the\r\ngibbet-station, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at\r\nonce, and not put it off. I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been\r\ninclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob\r\nthe pantry. There was no doing it in the night, for there was no getting\r\na light by easy friction then; to have got one I must have struck it out\r\nof flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very pirate himself\r\nrattling his chains.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot\r\nwith gray, I got up and went downstairs; every board upon the way, and\r\nevery crack in every board calling after me, "Stop thief!" and "Get up,\r\nMrs. Joe!" In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied than\r\nusual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a hare hanging\r\nup by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my back was half\r\nturned, winking. I had no time for verification, no time for selection,\r\nno time for anything, for I had no time to spare. I stole some bread,\r\nsome rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat (which I tied up in\r\nmy pocket-handkerchief with my last night\'s slice), some brandy from a\r\nstone bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I had secretly used\r\nfor making that intoxicating fluid, Spanish-liquorice-water, up in my\r\nroom: diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard),\r\na meat bone with very little on it, and a beautiful round compact pork\r\npie. I was nearly going away without the pie, but I was tempted to mount\r\nupon a shelf, to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a\r\ncovered earthenware dish in a corner, and I found it was the pie, and\r\nI took it in the hope that it was not intended for early use, and would\r\nnot be missed for some time.\r\n\r\nThere was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I\r\nunlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe\'s tools.\r\nThen I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at which\r\nI had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for the misty\r\nmarshes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\nIt was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on the\r\noutside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there all\r\nnight, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw the\r\ndamp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort of\r\nspiders\' webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade. On\r\nevery rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so thick,\r\nthat the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village--a\r\ndirection which they never accepted, for they never came there--was\r\ninvisible to me until I was quite close under it. Then, as I looked up\r\nat it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a\r\nphantom devoting me to the Hulks.\r\n\r\nThe mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so that\r\ninstead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me.\r\nThis was very disagreeable to a guilty mind. The gates and dikes and\r\nbanks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainly\r\nas could be, "A boy with somebody else\'s pork pie! Stop him!" The\r\ncattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes,\r\nand steaming out of their nostrils, "Halloa, young thief!" One black\r\nox, with a white cravat on,--who even had to my awakened conscience\r\nsomething of a clerical air,--fixed me so obstinately with his eyes,\r\nand moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved\r\nround, that I blubbered out to him, "I couldn\'t help it, sir! It wasn\'t\r\nfor myself I took it!" Upon which he put down his head, blew a cloud of\r\nsmoke out of his nose, and vanished with a kick-up of his hind-legs and\r\na flourish of his tail.\r\n\r\nAll this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I\r\nwent, I couldn\'t warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted, as\r\nthe iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet. I knew\r\nmy way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there on a\r\nSunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me that when\r\nI was \'prentice to him, regularly bound, we would have such Larks there!\r\nHowever, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last too far to\r\nthe right, and consequently had to try back along the river-side, on the\r\nbank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide\r\nout. Making my way along here with all despatch, I had just crossed a\r\nditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and had just scrambled\r\nup the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the man sitting before me.\r\nHis back was towards me, and he had his arms folded, and was nodding\r\nforward, heavy with sleep.\r\n\r\nI thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast,\r\nin that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him on\r\nthe shoulder. He instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, but\r\nanother man!\r\n\r\nAnd yet this man was dressed in coarse gray, too, and had a great iron\r\non his leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything that\r\nthe other man was; except that he had not the same face, and had a flat\r\nbroad-brimmed low-crowned felt hat on. All this I saw in a moment, for\r\nI had only a moment to see it in: he swore an oath at me, made a hit at\r\nme,--it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself\r\ndown, for it made him stumble,--and then he ran into the mist, stumbling\r\ntwice as he went, and I lost him.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the young man!" I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I identified\r\nhim. I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, if I had\r\nknown where it was.\r\n\r\nI was soon at the Battery after that, and there was the right\r\nman,--hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he had never all\r\nnight left off hugging and limping,--waiting for me. He was awfully\r\ncold, to be sure. I half expected to see him drop down before my face\r\nand die of deadly cold. His eyes looked so awfully hungry too, that when\r\nI handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass, it occurred to\r\nme he would have tried to eat it, if he had not seen my bundle. He did\r\nnot turn me upside down this time to get at what I had, but left me\r\nright side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied my pockets.\r\n\r\n"What\'s in the bottle, boy?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Brandy," said I.\r\n\r\nHe was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious\r\nmanner,--more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent\r\nhurry, than a man who was eating it,--but he left off to take some of\r\nthe liquor. He shivered all the while so violently, that it was quite\r\nas much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his teeth,\r\nwithout biting it off.\r\n\r\n"I think you have got the ague," said I.\r\n\r\n"I\'m much of your opinion, boy," said he.\r\n\r\n"It\'s bad about here," I told him. "You\'ve been lying out on the meshes,\r\nand they\'re dreadful aguish. Rheumatic too."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll eat my breakfast afore they\'re the death of me," said he. "I\'d do\r\nthat, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is\r\nover there, directly afterwards. I\'ll beat the shivers so far, I\'ll bet\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nHe was gobbling mincemeat, meatbone, bread, cheese, and pork pie, all\r\nat once: staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round\r\nus, and often stopping--even stopping his jaws--to listen. Some real or\r\nfancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the\r\nmarsh, now gave him a start, and he said, suddenly,--\r\n\r\n"You\'re not a deceiving imp? You brought no one with you?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir! No!"\r\n\r\n"Nor giv\' no one the office to follow you?"\r\n\r\n"No!"\r\n\r\n"Well," said he, "I believe you. You\'d be but a fierce young hound\r\nindeed, if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched\r\nwarmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint\r\nis!"\r\n\r\nSomething clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock,\r\nand was going to strike. And he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nPitying his desolation, and watching him as he gradually settled down\r\nupon the pie, I made bold to say, "I am glad you enjoy it."\r\n\r\n"Did you speak?"\r\n\r\n"I said I was glad you enjoyed it."\r\n\r\n"Thankee, my boy. I do."\r\n\r\nI had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food; and I now\r\nnoticed a decided similarity between the dog\'s way of eating, and the\r\nman\'s. The man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog. He\r\nswallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast;\r\nand he looked sideways here and there while he ate, as if he thought\r\nthere was danger in every direction of somebody\'s coming to take the pie\r\naway. He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it, to appreciate\r\nit comfortably I thought, or to have anybody to dine with him, without\r\nmaking a chop with his jaws at the visitor. In all of which particulars\r\nhe was very like the dog.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid you won\'t leave any of it for him," said I, timidly; after\r\na silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of making\r\nthe remark. "There\'s no more to be got where that came from." It was the\r\ncertainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint.\r\n\r\n"Leave any for him? Who\'s him?" said my friend, stopping in his\r\ncrunching of pie-crust.\r\n\r\n"The young man. That you spoke of. That was hid with you."\r\n\r\n"Oh ah!" he returned, with something like a gruff laugh. "Him? Yes, yes!\r\nHe don\'t want no wittles."\r\n\r\n"I thought he looked as if he did," said I.\r\n\r\nThe man stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and\r\nthe greatest surprise.\r\n\r\n"Looked? When?"\r\n\r\n"Just now."\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"Yonder," said I, pointing; "over there, where I found him nodding\r\nasleep, and thought it was you."\r\n\r\nHe held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think his\r\nfirst idea about cutting my throat had revived.\r\n\r\n"Dressed like you, you know, only with a hat," I explained, trembling;\r\n"and--and"--I was very anxious to put this delicately--"and with--the\r\nsame reason for wanting to borrow a file. Didn\'t you hear the cannon\r\nlast night?"\r\n\r\n"Then there was firing!" he said to himself.\r\n\r\n"I wonder you shouldn\'t have been sure of that," I returned, "for\r\nwe heard it up at home, and that\'s farther away, and we were shut in\r\nbesides."\r\n\r\n"Why, see now!" said he. "When a man\'s alone on these flats, with a\r\nlight head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, he hears\r\nnothin\' all night, but guns firing, and voices calling. Hears? He sees\r\nthe soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried\r\nafore, closing in round him. Hears his number called, hears himself\r\nchallenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders \'Make\r\nready! Present! Cover him steady, men!\' and is laid hands on--and\r\nthere\'s nothin\'! Why, if I see one pursuing party last night--coming up\r\nin order, Damn \'em, with their tramp, tramp--I see a hundred. And as to\r\nfiring! Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broad\r\nday,--But this man"; he had said all the rest, as if he had forgotten my\r\nbeing there; "did you notice anything in him?"\r\n\r\n"He had a badly bruised face," said I, recalling what I hardly knew I\r\nknew.\r\n\r\n"Not here?" exclaimed the man, striking his left cheek mercilessly, with\r\nthe flat of his hand.\r\n\r\n"Yes, there!"\r\n\r\n"Where is he?" He crammed what little food was left, into the breast of\r\nhis gray jacket. "Show me the way he went. I\'ll pull him down, like a\r\nbloodhound. Curse this iron on my sore leg! Give us hold of the file,\r\nboy."\r\n\r\nI indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man,\r\nand he looked up at it for an instant. But he was down on the rank wet\r\ngrass, filing at his iron like a madman, and not minding me or minding\r\nhis own leg, which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody, but which he\r\nhandled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file. I\r\nwas very much afraid of him again, now that he had worked himself into\r\nthis fierce hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping away\r\nfrom home any longer. I told him I must go, but he took no notice, so\r\nI thought the best thing I could do was to slip off. The last I saw\r\nof him, his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his\r\nfetter, muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg. The last\r\nI heard of him, I stopped in the mist to listen, and the file was still\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\nI fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take me\r\nup. But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yet\r\nbeen made of the robbery. Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the\r\nhouse ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon\r\nthe kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan,--an article into\r\nwhich his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister was\r\nvigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.\r\n\r\n"And where the deuce ha\' you been?" was Mrs. Joe\'s Christmas salutation,\r\nwhen I and my conscience showed ourselves.\r\n\r\nI said I had been down to hear the Carols. "Ah! well!" observed Mrs.\r\nJoe. "You might ha\' done worse." Not a doubt of that I thought.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps if I warn\'t a blacksmith\'s wife, and (what\'s the same thing) a\r\nslave with her apron never off, I should have been to hear the Carols,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Joe. "I\'m rather partial to Carols, myself, and that\'s the\r\nbest of reasons for my never hearing any."\r\n\r\nJoe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had\r\nretired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a\r\nconciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her eyes\r\nwere withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and exhibited them\r\nto me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper. This was so\r\nmuch her normal state, that Joe and I would often, for weeks together,\r\nbe, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to their legs.\r\n\r\nWe were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork and\r\ngreens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mince-pie had\r\nbeen made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not\r\nbeing missed), and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive\r\narrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of\r\nbreakfast; "for I ain\'t," said Mrs. Joe,--"I ain\'t a going to have\r\nno formal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I\'ve got\r\nbefore me, I promise you!"\r\n\r\nSo, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on a\r\nforced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of milk\r\nand water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the dresser. In\r\nthe meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and tacked a new\r\nflowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one, and\r\nuncovered the little state parlor across the passage, which was never\r\nuncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the year in a cool\r\nhaze of silver paper, which even extended to the four little white\r\ncrockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black nose and a\r\nbasket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart of the other.\r\nMrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of\r\nmaking her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt\r\nitself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the same by\r\ntheir religion.\r\n\r\nMy sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that\r\nis to say, Joe and I were going. In his working-clothes, Joe was a\r\nwell-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes,\r\nhe was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.\r\nNothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; and\r\neverything that he wore then grazed him. On the present festive occasion\r\nhe emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going, the picture\r\nof misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me, I think my\r\nsister must have had some general idea that I was a young offender whom\r\nan Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) and delivered over\r\nto her, to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law.\r\nI was always treated as if I had insisted on being born in opposition\r\nto the dictates of reason, religion, and morality, and against the\r\ndissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I was taken to have\r\na new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of\r\nReformatory, and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs.\r\n\r\nJoe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle\r\nfor compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to\r\nwhat I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever\r\nMrs. Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be\r\nequalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had\r\ndone. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the\r\nChurch would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the\r\nterrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived the\r\nidea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said,\r\n"Ye are now to declare it!" would be the time for me to rise and propose\r\na private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure that I\r\nmight not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this\r\nextreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble\r\nthe wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe\'s uncle,\r\nbut Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler in\r\nthe nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart. The dinner hour was\r\nhalf-past one. When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and\r\nMrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked\r\n(it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, and\r\neverything most splendid. And still, not a word of the robbery.\r\n\r\nThe time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and\r\nthe company came. Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large shining\r\nbald forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud of; indeed\r\nit was understood among his acquaintance that if you could only give him\r\nhis head, he would read the clergyman into fits; he himself confessed\r\nthat if the Church was "thrown open," meaning to competition, he would\r\nnot despair of making his mark in it. The Church not being "thrown\r\nopen," he was, as I have said, our clerk. But he punished the Amens\r\ntremendously; and when he gave out the psalm,--always giving the whole\r\nverse,--he looked all round the congregation first, as much as to say,\r\n"You have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with your opinion of this\r\nstyle!"\r\n\r\nI opened the door to the company,--making believe that it was a habit\r\nof ours to open that door,--and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next\r\nto Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook. N.B. I was\r\nnot allowed to call him uncle, under the severest penalties.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Joe," said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-aged\r\nslow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair\r\nstanding upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just been\r\nall but choked, and had that moment come to, "I have brought you as the\r\ncompliments of the season--I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry\r\nwine--and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine."\r\n\r\nEvery Christmas Day he presented himself, as a profound novelty, with\r\nexactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells.\r\nEvery Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she now replied, "O, Un--cle\r\nPum-ble--chook! This is kind!" Every Christmas Day, he retorted, as\r\nhe now retorted, "It\'s no more than your merits. And now are you all\r\nbobbish, and how\'s Sixpennorth of halfpence?" meaning me.\r\n\r\nWe dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts\r\nand oranges and apples to the parlor; which was a change very like\r\nJoe\'s change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress. My sister was\r\nuncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally more\r\ngracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. I remember\r\nMrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue, who held a\r\nconventionally juvenile position, because she had married Mr. Hubble,--I\r\ndon\'t know at what remote period,--when she was much younger than he. I\r\nremember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered, stooping old man, of a\r\nsawdusty fragrance, with his legs extraordinarily wide apart: so that in\r\nmy short days I always saw some miles of open country between them when\r\nI met him coming up the lane.\r\n\r\nAmong this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn\'t\r\nrobbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in\r\nat an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and the\r\nPumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to speak\r\n(I didn\'t want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the scaly tips\r\nof the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure corners of pork\r\nof which the pig, when living, had had the least reason to be vain. No;\r\nI should not have minded that, if they would only have left me alone.\r\nBut they wouldn\'t leave me alone. They seemed to think the opportunity\r\nlost, if they failed to point the conversation at me, every now and\r\nthen, and stick the point into me. I might have been an unfortunate\r\nlittle bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched up by these\r\nmoral goads.\r\n\r\nIt began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with\r\ntheatrical declamation,--as it now appears to me, something like a\r\nreligious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,--and\r\nended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.\r\nUpon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a low\r\nreproachful voice, "Do you hear that? Be grateful."\r\n\r\n"Especially," said Mr. Pumblechook, "be grateful, boy, to them which\r\nbrought you up by hand."\r\n\r\nMrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful\r\npresentiment that I should come to no good, asked, "Why is it that the\r\nyoung are never grateful?" This moral mystery seemed too much for\r\nthe company until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, "Naterally\r\nwicious." Everybody then murmured "True!" and looked at me in a\r\nparticularly unpleasant and personal manner.\r\n\r\nJoe\'s station and influence were something feebler (if possible) when\r\nthere was company than when there was none. But he always aided and\r\ncomforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and he always did so\r\nat dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any. There being plenty\r\nof gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about half a\r\npint.\r\n\r\nA little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with\r\nsome severity, and intimated--in the usual hypothetical case of the\r\nChurch being "thrown open"--what kind of sermon he would have given\r\nthem. After favoring them with some heads of that discourse, he remarked\r\nthat he considered the subject of the day\'s homily, ill chosen; which\r\nwas the less excusable, he added, when there were so many subjects\r\n"going about."\r\n\r\n"True again," said Uncle Pumblechook. "You\'ve hit it, sir! Plenty of\r\nsubjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their\r\ntails. That\'s what\'s wanted. A man needn\'t go far to find a subject,\r\nif he\'s ready with his salt-box." Mr. Pumblechook added, after a short\r\ninterval of reflection, "Look at Pork alone. There\'s a subject! If you\r\nwant a subject, look at Pork!"\r\n\r\n"True, sir. Many a moral for the young," returned Mr. Wopsle,--and I\r\nknew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; "might be deduced\r\nfrom that text."\r\n\r\n("You listen to this," said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.)\r\n\r\nJoe gave me some more gravy.\r\n\r\n"Swine," pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his fork\r\nat my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,--"swine were\r\nthe companions of the prodigal. The gluttony of Swine is put before us,\r\nas an example to the young." (I thought this pretty well in him who\r\nhad been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.) "What is\r\ndetestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy."\r\n\r\n"Or girl," suggested Mr. Hubble.\r\n\r\n"Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble," assented Mr. Wopsle, rather irritably,\r\n"but there is no girl present."\r\n\r\n"Besides," said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, "think what you\'ve\r\ngot to be grateful for. If you\'d been born a Squeaker--"\r\n\r\n"He was, if ever a child was," said my sister, most emphatically.\r\n\r\nJoe gave me some more gravy.\r\n\r\n"Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker," said Mr. Pumblechook. "If you\r\nhad been born such, would you have been here now? Not you--"\r\n\r\n"Unless in that form," said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t mean in that form, sir," returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had\r\nan objection to being interrupted; "I mean, enjoying himself with his\r\nelders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and\r\nrolling in the lap of luxury. Would he have been doing that? No, he\r\nwouldn\'t. And what would have been your destination?" turning on me\r\nagain. "You would have been disposed of for so many shillings according\r\nto the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would have\r\ncome up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whipped you\r\nunder his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up his frock\r\nto get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he would have\r\nshed your blood and had your life. No bringing up by hand then. Not a\r\nbit of it!"\r\n\r\nJoe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.\r\n\r\n"He was a world of trouble to you, ma\'am," said Mrs. Hubble,\r\ncommiserating my sister.\r\n\r\n"Trouble?" echoed my sister; "trouble?" and then entered on a fearful\r\ncatalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts\r\nof sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled\r\nfrom, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I\r\nhad done myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and I\r\nhad contumaciously refused to go there.\r\n\r\nI think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with\r\ntheir noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in\r\nconsequence. Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle\'s Roman nose so aggravated me, during\r\nthe recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it\r\nuntil he howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in\r\ncomparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the\r\npause was broken which ensued upon my sister\'s recital, and in which\r\npause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) with\r\nindignation and abhorrence.\r\n\r\n"Yet," said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the\r\ntheme from which they had strayed, "Pork--regarded as biled--is rich,\r\ntoo; ain\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Have a little brandy, uncle," said my sister.\r\n\r\nO Heavens, it had come at last! He would find it was weak, he would say\r\nit was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the table under\r\nthe cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.\r\n\r\nMy sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle,\r\nand poured his brandy out: no one else taking any. The wretched man\r\ntrifled with his glass,--took it up, looked at it through the light,\r\nput it down,--prolonged my misery. All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were\r\nbriskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.\r\n\r\nI couldn\'t keep my eyes off him. Always holding tight by the leg of the\r\ntable with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger his\r\nglass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink\r\nthe brandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with\r\nunspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning\r\nround several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance,\r\nand rushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window,\r\nviolently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces, and\r\napparently out of his mind.\r\n\r\nI held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him. I didn\'t know how\r\nI had done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow. In my\r\ndreadful situation, it was a relief when he was brought back, and\r\nsurveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with him, sank\r\ndown into his chair with the one significant gasp, "Tar!"\r\n\r\nI had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug. I knew he would be\r\nworse by and by. I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day, by\r\nthe vigor of my unseen hold upon it.\r\n\r\n"Tar!" cried my sister, in amazement. "Why, how ever could Tar come\r\nthere?"\r\n\r\nBut, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn\'t\r\nhear the word, wouldn\'t hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all\r\naway with his hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My sister, who had\r\nbegun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively in\r\ngetting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and mixing\r\nthem. For the time being at least, I was saved. I still held on to the\r\nleg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of\r\npudding. Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding. All partook of pudding.\r\nThe course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the\r\ngenial influence of gin and water. I began to think I should get over\r\nthe day, when my sister said to Joe, "Clean plates,--cold."\r\n\r\nI clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my\r\nbosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul.\r\nI foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was gone.\r\n\r\n"You must taste," said my sister, addressing the guests with her best\r\ngrace--"you must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and delicious\r\npresent of Uncle Pumblechook\'s!"\r\n\r\nMust they! Let them not hope to taste it!\r\n\r\n"You must know," said my sister, rising, "it\'s a pie; a savory pork\r\npie."\r\n\r\nThe company murmured their compliments. Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of\r\nhaving deserved well of his fellow-creatures, said,--quite vivaciously,\r\nall things considered,--"Well, Mrs. Joe, we\'ll do our best endeavors;\r\nlet us have a cut at this same pie."\r\n\r\nMy sister went out to get it. I heard her steps proceed to the pantry. I\r\nsaw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife. I saw reawakening appetite in the\r\nRoman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle. I heard Mr. Hubble remark that "a bit of\r\nsavory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do\r\nno harm," and I heard Joe say, "You shall have some, Pip." I have never\r\nbeen absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror,\r\nmerely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company. I felt that I\r\ncould bear no more, and that I must run away. I released the leg of the\r\ntable, and ran for my life.\r\n\r\nBut I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremost\r\ninto a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a pair\r\nof handcuffs to me, saying, "Here you are, look sharp, come on!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\nThe apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but-ends of their\r\nloaded muskets on our door-step, caused the dinner-party to rise\r\nfrom table in confusion, and caused Mrs. Joe re-entering the kitchen\r\nempty-handed, to stop short and stare, in her wondering lament of\r\n"Gracious goodness gracious me, what\'s gone--with the--pie!"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring;\r\nat which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses. It was\r\nthe sergeant who had spoken to me, and he was now looking round at the\r\ncompany, with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his\r\nright hand, and his left on my shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, ladies and gentleman," said the sergeant, "but as I have\r\nmentioned at the door to this smart young shaver," (which he hadn\'t), "I\r\nam on a chase in the name of the king, and I want the blacksmith."\r\n\r\n"And pray what might you want with him?" retorted my sister, quick to\r\nresent his being wanted at all.\r\n\r\n"Missis," returned the gallant sergeant, "speaking for myself, I should\r\nreply, the honor and pleasure of his fine wife\'s acquaintance; speaking\r\nfor the king, I answer, a little job done."\r\n\r\nThis was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mr.\r\nPumblechook cried audibly, "Good again!"\r\n\r\n"You see, blacksmith," said the sergeant, who had by this time picked\r\nout Joe with his eye, "we have had an accident with these, and I find\r\nthe lock of one of \'em goes wrong, and the coupling don\'t act pretty.\r\nAs they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over\r\nthem?"\r\n\r\nJoe threw his eye over them, and pronounced that the job would\r\nnecessitate the lighting of his forge fire, and would take nearer\r\ntwo hours than one. "Will it? Then will you set about it at once,\r\nblacksmith?" said the off-hand sergeant, "as it\'s on his Majesty\'s\r\nservice. And if my men can bear a hand anywhere, they\'ll make themselves\r\nuseful." With that, he called to his men, who came trooping into the\r\nkitchen one after another, and piled their arms in a corner. And then\r\nthey stood about, as soldiers do; now, with their hands loosely clasped\r\nbefore them; now, resting a knee or a shoulder; now, easing a belt or a\r\npouch; now, opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks, out\r\ninto the yard.\r\n\r\nAll these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them, for I\r\nwas in an agony of apprehension. But beginning to perceive that the\r\nhandcuffs were not for me, and that the military had so far got the\r\nbetter of the pie as to put it in the background, I collected a little\r\nmore of my scattered wits.\r\n\r\n"Would you give me the time?" said the sergeant, addressing himself to\r\nMr. Pumblechook, as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the\r\ninference that he was equal to the time.\r\n\r\n"It\'s just gone half past two."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not so bad," said the sergeant, reflecting; "even if I was\r\nforced to halt here nigh two hours, that\'ll do. How far might you call\r\nyourselves from the marshes, hereabouts? Not above a mile, I reckon?"\r\n\r\n"Just a mile," said Mrs. Joe.\r\n\r\n"That\'ll do. We begin to close in upon \'em about dusk. A little before\r\ndusk, my orders are. That\'ll do."\r\n\r\n"Convicts, sergeant?" asked Mr. Wopsle, in a matter-of-course way.\r\n\r\n"Ay!" returned the sergeant, "two. They\'re pretty well known to be out\r\non the marshes still, and they won\'t try to get clear of \'em before\r\ndusk. Anybody here seen anything of any such game?"\r\n\r\nEverybody, myself excepted, said no, with confidence. Nobody thought of\r\nme.\r\n\r\n"Well!" said the sergeant, "they\'ll find themselves trapped in a circle,\r\nI expect, sooner than they count on. Now, blacksmith! If you\'re ready,\r\nhis Majesty the King is."\r\n\r\nJoe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his leather apron\r\non, and passed into the forge. One of the soldiers opened its wooden\r\nwindows, another lighted the fire, another turned to at the bellows, the\r\nrest stood round the blaze, which was soon roaring. Then Joe began to\r\nhammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general\r\nattention, but even made my sister liberal. She drew a pitcher of beer\r\nfrom the cask for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take a glass\r\nof brandy. But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, "Give him wine, Mum. I\'ll\r\nengage there\'s no tar in that:" so, the sergeant thanked him and said\r\nthat as he preferred his drink without tar, he would take wine, if it\r\nwas equally convenient. When it was given him, he drank his Majesty\'s\r\nhealth and compliments of the season, and took it all at a mouthful and\r\nsmacked his lips.\r\n\r\n"Good stuff, eh, sergeant?" said Mr. Pumblechook.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you something," returned the sergeant; "I suspect that\r\nstuff\'s of your providing."\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, "Ay, ay? Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because," returned the sergeant, clapping him on the shoulder, "you\'re\r\na man that knows what\'s what."\r\n\r\n"D\'ye think so?" said Mr. Pumblechook, with his former laugh. "Have\r\nanother glass!"\r\n\r\n"With you. Hob and nob," returned the sergeant. "The top of mine to the\r\nfoot of yours,--the foot of yours to the top of mine,--Ring once, ring\r\ntwice,--the best tune on the Musical Glasses! Your health. May you live\r\na thousand years, and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you\r\nare at the present moment of your life!"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for\r\nanother glass. I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality\r\nappeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took the\r\nbottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a\r\ngush of joviality. Even I got some. And he was so very free of the wine\r\nthat he even called for the other bottle, and handed that about with the\r\nsame liberality, when the first was gone.\r\n\r\nAs I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge,\r\nenjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for\r\na dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was. They had not enjoyed\r\nthemselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightened\r\nwith the excitement he furnished. And now, when they were all in lively\r\nanticipation of "the two villains" being taken, and when the bellows\r\nseemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke\r\nto hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them,\r\nand all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the\r\nblaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale\r\nafternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned\r\npale on their account, poor wretches.\r\n\r\nAt last, Joe\'s job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped. As Joe\r\ngot on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of us should\r\ngo down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt. Mr. Pumblechook\r\nand Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies\' society; but\r\nMr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would. Joe said he was agreeable,\r\nand would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved. We never should have got leave\r\nto go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe\'s curiosity to know all about it and\r\nhow it ended. As it was, she merely stipulated, "If you bring the boy\r\nback with his head blown to bits by a musket, don\'t look to me to put it\r\ntogether again."\r\n\r\nThe sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr.\r\nPumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fully\r\nsensible of that gentleman\'s merits under arid conditions, as when\r\nsomething moist was going. His men resumed their muskets and fell in.\r\nMr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and\r\nto speak no word after we reached the marshes. When we were all out in\r\nthe raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I treasonably\r\nwhispered to Joe, "I hope, Joe, we shan\'t find them." and Joe whispered\r\nto me, "I\'d give a shilling if they had cut and run, Pip."\r\n\r\nWe were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was\r\ncold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming\r\non, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day. A\r\nfew faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came\r\nout. We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard.\r\nThere we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant\'s\r\nhand, while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the\r\ngraves, and also examined the porch. They came in again without finding\r\nanything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate\r\nat the side of the churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us\r\nhere on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.\r\n\r\nNow that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little\r\nthought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men\r\nhiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should\r\ncome upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who\r\nhad brought the soldiers there? He had asked me if I was a deceiving\r\nimp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the\r\nhunt against him. Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in\r\ntreacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?\r\n\r\nIt was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on Joe\'s\r\nback, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a\r\nhunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and\r\nto keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a\r\npretty wide line with an interval between man and man. We were taking\r\nthe course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.\r\nEither the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.\r\nUnder the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the\r\nmound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain,\r\nthough all of a watery lead color.\r\n\r\nWith my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe\'s broad shoulder, I\r\nlooked all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, I could\r\nhear none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by his\r\nblowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and\r\ncould dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful\r\nstart, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a\r\nsheep-bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at\r\nus; and the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared\r\nangrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except\r\nthese things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,\r\nthere was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and we\r\nwere moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a sudden, we all\r\nstopped. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a\r\nlong shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but\r\nit was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised\r\ntogether,--if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.\r\n\r\nTo this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under\r\ntheir breath, when Joe and I came up. After another moment\'s listening,\r\nJoe (who was a good judge) agreed, and Mr. Wopsle (who was a bad judge)\r\nagreed. The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not\r\nbe answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his men\r\nshould make towards it "at the double." So we slanted to the right\r\n(where the East was), and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had to\r\nhold on tight to keep my seat.\r\n\r\nIt was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words he\r\nspoke all the time, "a Winder." Down banks and up banks, and over gates,\r\nand splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes: no man cared\r\nwhere he went. As we came nearer to the shouting, it became more and\r\nmore apparent that it was made by more than one voice. Sometimes, it\r\nseemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped. When it broke\r\nout again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever, and we\r\nafter them. After a while, we had so run it down, that we could hear one\r\nvoice calling "Murder!" and another voice, "Convicts! Runaways! Guard!\r\nThis way for the runaway convicts!" Then both voices would seem to be\r\nstifled in a struggle, and then would break out again. And when it had\r\ncome to this, the soldiers ran like deer, and Joe too.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, and two\r\nof his men ran in close upon him. Their pieces were cocked and levelled\r\nwhen we all ran in.\r\n\r\n"Here are both men!" panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a\r\nditch. "Surrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts! Come\r\nasunder!"\r\n\r\nWater was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn, and\r\nblows were being struck, when some more men went down into the ditch to\r\nhelp the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict and the other\r\none. Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling; but\r\nof course I knew them both directly.\r\n\r\n"Mind!" said my convict, wiping blood from his face with his ragged\r\nsleeves, and shaking torn hair from his fingers: "I took him! I give him\r\nup to you! Mind that!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not much to be particular about," said the sergeant; "it\'ll do you\r\nsmall good, my man, being in the same plight yourself. Handcuffs there!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t expect it to do me any good. I don\'t want it to do me more good\r\nthan it does now," said my convict, with a greedy laugh. "I took him. He\r\nknows it. That\'s enough for me."\r\n\r\nThe other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old\r\nbruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.\r\nHe could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were both\r\nseparately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from\r\nfalling.\r\n\r\n"Take notice, guard,--he tried to murder me," were his first words.\r\n\r\n"Tried to murder him?" said my convict, disdainfully. "Try, and not\r\ndo it? I took him, and giv\' him up; that\'s what I done. I not only\r\nprevented him getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here,--dragged\r\nhim this far on his way back. He\'s a gentleman, if you please, this\r\nvillain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me. Murder\r\nhim? Worth my while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and drag\r\nhim back!"\r\n\r\nThe other one still gasped, "He tried--he tried-to--murder me.\r\nBear--bear witness."\r\n\r\n"Lookee here!" said my convict to the sergeant. "Single-handed I got\r\nclear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it. I could ha\' got\r\nclear of these death-cold flats likewise--look at my leg: you won\'t find\r\nmuch iron on it--if I hadn\'t made the discovery that he was here. Let\r\nhim go free? Let him profit by the means as I found out? Let him make a\r\ntool of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. If I had died at\r\nthe bottom there," and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his\r\nmanacled hands, "I\'d have held to him with that grip, that you should\r\nhave been safe to find him in my hold."\r\n\r\nThe other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of his\r\ncompanion, repeated, "He tried to murder me. I should have been a dead\r\nman if you had not come up."\r\n\r\n"He lies!" said my convict, with fierce energy. "He\'s a liar born, and\r\nhe\'ll die a liar. Look at his face; ain\'t it written there? Let him turn\r\nthose eyes of his on me. I defy him to do it."\r\n\r\nThe other, with an effort at a scornful smile, which could not, however,\r\ncollect the nervous working of his mouth into any set expression, looked\r\nat the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes and at the sky, but\r\ncertainly did not look at the speaker.\r\n\r\n"Do you see him?" pursued my convict. "Do you see what a villain he is?\r\nDo you see those grovelling and wandering eyes? That\'s how he looked\r\nwhen we were tried together. He never looked at me."\r\n\r\nThe other, always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes\r\nrestlessly about him far and near, did at last turn them for a moment on\r\nthe speaker, with the words, "You are not much to look at," and with\r\na half-taunting glance at the bound hands. At that point, my convict\r\nbecame so frantically exasperated, that he would have rushed upon him\r\nbut for the interposition of the soldiers. "Didn\'t I tell you," said the\r\nother convict then, "that he would murder me, if he could?" And any one\r\ncould see that he shook with fear, and that there broke out upon his\r\nlips curious white flakes, like thin snow.\r\n\r\n"Enough of this parley," said the sergeant. "Light those torches."\r\n\r\nAs one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went down\r\non his knee to open it, my convict looked round him for the first time,\r\nand saw me. I had alighted from Joe\'s back on the brink of the ditch\r\nwhen we came up, and had not moved since. I looked at him eagerly when\r\nhe looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head. I had\r\nbeen waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of my\r\ninnocence. It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended\r\nmy intention, for he gave me a look that I did not understand, and it\r\nall passed in a moment. But if he had looked at me for an hour or for\r\na day, I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards, as having\r\nbeen more attentive.\r\n\r\nThe soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four\r\ntorches, and took one himself and distributed the others. It had been\r\nalmost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards\r\nvery dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in\r\na ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other torches kindled\r\nat some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the opposite\r\nbank of the river. "All right," said the sergeant. "March."\r\n\r\nWe had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a\r\nsound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. "You are expected\r\non board," said the sergeant to my convict; "they know you are coming.\r\nDon\'t straggle, my man. Close up here."\r\n\r\nThe two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate guard.\r\nI had hold of Joe\'s hand now, and Joe carried one of the torches. Mr.\r\nWopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to see it out, so\r\nwe went on with the party. There was a reasonably good path now, mostly\r\non the edge of the river, with a divergence here and there where a dike\r\ncame, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluice-gate. When\r\nI looked round, I could see the other lights coming in after us. The\r\ntorches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon the track, and\r\nI could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I could see nothing\r\nelse but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air about us with their\r\npitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that, as they\r\nlimped along in the midst of the muskets. We could not go fast, because\r\nof their lameness; and they were so spent, that two or three times we\r\nhad to halt while they rested.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hut\r\nand a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged,\r\nand the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut, where there was\r\na smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and\r\na stand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an\r\novergrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a dozen\r\nsoldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their\r\ngreat-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their heads\r\nand took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again. The sergeant made some\r\nkind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the convict whom I\r\ncall the other convict was drafted off with his guard, to go on board\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nMy convict never looked at me, except that once. While we stood in the\r\nhut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up\r\nhis feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if\r\nhe pitied them for their recent adventures. Suddenly, he turned to the\r\nsergeant, and remarked,--\r\n\r\n"I wish to say something respecting this escape. It may prevent some\r\npersons laying under suspicion alonger me."\r\n\r\n"You can say what you like," returned the sergeant, standing coolly\r\nlooking at him with his arms folded, "but you have no call to say it\r\nhere. You\'ll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear about it,\r\nbefore it\'s done with, you know."\r\n\r\n"I know, but this is another pint, a separate matter. A man can\'t\r\nstarve; at least I can\'t. I took some wittles, up at the willage over\r\nyonder,--where the church stands a\'most out on the marshes."\r\n\r\n"You mean stole," said the sergeant.\r\n\r\n"And I\'ll tell you where from. From the blacksmith\'s."\r\n\r\n"Halloa!" said the sergeant, staring at Joe.\r\n\r\n"Halloa, Pip!" said Joe, staring at me.\r\n\r\n"It was some broken wittles--that\'s what it was--and a dram of liquor,\r\nand a pie."\r\n\r\n"Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?" asked\r\nthe sergeant, confidentially.\r\n\r\n"My wife did, at the very moment when you came in. Don\'t you know, Pip?"\r\n\r\n"So," said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and\r\nwithout the least glance at me,--"so you\'re the blacksmith, are you?\r\nThan I\'m sorry to say, I\'ve eat your pie."\r\n\r\n"God knows you\'re welcome to it,--so far as it was ever mine," returned\r\nJoe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe. "We don\'t know what you have\r\ndone, but we wouldn\'t have you starved to death for it, poor miserable\r\nfellow-creatur.--Would us, Pip?"\r\n\r\nThe something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man\'s throat\r\nagain, and he turned his back. The boat had returned, and his guard were\r\nready, so we followed him to the landing-place made of rough stakes\r\nand stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was rowed by a crew of\r\nconvicts like himself. No one seemed surprised to see him, or interested\r\nin seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, or spoke a word,\r\nexcept that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs, "Give way,\r\nyou!" which was the signal for the dip of the oars. By the light of the\r\ntorches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from the mud of\r\nthe shore, like a wicked Noah\'s ark. Cribbed and barred and moored by\r\nmassive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes to be\r\nironed like the prisoners. We saw the boat go alongside, and we saw\r\nhim taken up the side and disappear. Then, the ends of the torches were\r\nflung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all over with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\nMy state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been so\r\nunexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure; but I hope\r\nit had some dregs of good at the bottom of it.\r\n\r\nI do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference\r\nto Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me. But\r\nI loved Joe,--perhaps for no better reason in those early days than\r\nbecause the dear fellow let me love him,--and, as to him, my inner self\r\nwas not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind (particularly when\r\nI first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought to tell Joe the\r\nwhole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted that\r\nif I did, he would think me worse than I was. The fear of losing Joe\'s\r\nconfidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night\r\nstaring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up my\r\ntongue. I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I never\r\nafterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker,\r\nwithout thinking that he was meditating on it. That, if Joe knew it, I\r\nnever afterwards could see him glance, however casually, at yesterday\'s\r\nmeat or pudding when it came on to-day\'s table, without thinking that he\r\nwas debating whether I had been in the pantry. That, if Joe knew it, and\r\nat any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his\r\nbeer was flat or thick, the conviction that he suspected tar in it,\r\nwould bring a rush of blood to my face. In a word, I was too cowardly\r\nto do what I knew to be right, as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing\r\nwhat I knew to be wrong. I had had no intercourse with the world at\r\nthat time, and I imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this\r\nmanner. Quite an untaught genius, I made the discovery of the line of\r\naction for myself.\r\n\r\nAs I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Joe took\r\nme on his back again and carried me home. He must have had a tiresome\r\njourney of it, for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad\r\ntemper that if the Church had been thrown open, he would probably have\r\nexcommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Joe and myself. In\r\nhis lay capacity, he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such\r\nan insane extent, that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the\r\nkitchen fire, the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have\r\nhanged him, if it had been a capital offence.\r\n\r\nBy that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little\r\ndrunkard, through having been newly set upon my feet, and through having\r\nbeen fast asleep, and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of\r\ntongues. As I came to myself (with the aid of a heavy thump between the\r\nshoulders, and the restorative exclamation "Yah! Was there ever such\r\na boy as this!" from my sister,) I found Joe telling them about the\r\nconvict\'s confession, and all the visitors suggesting different ways\r\nby which he had got into the pantry. Mr. Pumblechook made out, after\r\ncarefully surveying the premises, that he had first got upon the roof of\r\nthe forge, and had then got upon the roof of the house, and had then let\r\nhimself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut\r\ninto strips; and as Mr. Pumblechook was very positive and drove his\r\nown chaise-cart--over everybody--it was agreed that it must be so. Mr.\r\nWopsle, indeed, wildly cried out, "No!" with the feeble malice of a\r\ntired man; but, as he had no theory, and no coat on, he was unanimously\r\nset at naught,--not to mention his smoking hard behind, as he stood\r\nwith his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out: which was not\r\ncalculated to inspire confidence.\r\n\r\nThis was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me, as a\r\nslumberous offence to the company\'s eyesight, and assisted me up to bed\r\nwith such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and to be\r\ndangling them all against the edges of the stairs. My state of mind, as\r\nI have described it, began before I was up in the morning, and lasted\r\nlong after the subject had died out, and had ceased to be mentioned\r\nsaving on exceptional occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\nAt the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family\r\ntombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out. My\r\nconstruction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I\r\nread "wife of the Above" as a complimentary reference to my father\'s\r\nexaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased relations\r\nhad been referred to as "Below," I have no doubt I should have formed\r\nthe worst opinions of that member of the family. Neither were my notions\r\nof the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, at\r\nall accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my\r\ndeclaration that I was to "walk in the same all the days of my life,"\r\nlaid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our\r\nhouse in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning down\r\nby the wheelwright\'s or up by the mill.\r\n\r\nWhen I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until I could\r\nassume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called "Pompeyed," or\r\n(as I render it) pampered. Therefore, I was not only odd-boy about the\r\nforge, but if any neighbor happened to want an extra boy to frighten\r\nbirds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I was favored with the\r\nemployment. In order, however, that our superior position might not be\r\ncompromised thereby, a money-box was kept on the kitchen mantel-shelf,\r\ninto which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were\r\ndropped. I have an impression that they were to be contributed\r\neventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt, but I know I\r\nhad no hope of any personal participation in the treasure.\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle\'s great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that is\r\nto say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited\r\ninfirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in\r\nthe society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the improving\r\nopportunity of seeing her do it. She rented a small cottage, and Mr.\r\nWopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used to overhear him\r\nreading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and occasionally\r\nbumping on the ceiling. There was a fiction that Mr. Wopsle "examined"\r\nthe scholars once a quarter. What he did on those occasions was to turn\r\nup his cuffs, stick up his hair, and give us Mark Antony\'s oration over\r\nthe body of Caesar. This was always followed by Collins\'s Ode on\r\nthe Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mr. Wopsle as Revenge\r\nthrowing his blood-stained sword in thunder down, and taking the\r\nWar-denouncing trumpet with a withering look. It was not with me then,\r\nas it was in later life, when I fell into the society of the Passions,\r\nand compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the disadvantage of\r\nboth gentlemen.\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle\'s great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution,\r\nkept in the same room--a little general shop. She had no idea what stock\r\nshe had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was a little\r\ngreasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a Catalogue\r\nof Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop transactions.\r\nBiddy was Mr. Wopsle\'s great-aunt\'s granddaughter; I confess myself\r\nquite unequal to the working out of the problem, what relation she was\r\nto Mr. Wopsle. She was an orphan like myself; like me, too, had been\r\nbrought up by hand. She was most noticeable, I thought, in respect of\r\nher extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing, her hands always\r\nwanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at\r\nheel. This description must be received with a week-day limitation. On\r\nSundays, she went to church elaborated.\r\n\r\nMuch of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr.\r\nWopsle\'s great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been\r\na bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and scratched by every\r\nletter. After that I fell among those thieves, the nine figures, who\r\nseemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and\r\nbaffle recognition. But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, to\r\nread, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale.\r\n\r\nOne night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expending\r\ngreat efforts on the production of a letter to Joe. I think it must have\r\nbeen a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was a long\r\ntime after, and it was winter and a hard frost. With an alphabet on the\r\nhearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or two to print\r\nand smear this epistle:--\r\n\r\n"MI DEER JO i OPE U R KRWITE WELL i OPE i SHAL SON B HABELL 4 2 TEEDGE\r\nU JO AN THEN WE SHORL B SO GLODD AN WEN i M PRENGTD 2 U JO WOT LARX AN\r\nBLEVE ME INF XN PIP."\r\n\r\nThere was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe by\r\nletter, inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone. But I delivered\r\nthis written communication (slate and all) with my own hand, and Joe\r\nreceived it as a miracle of erudition.\r\n\r\n"I say, Pip, old chap!" cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, "what a\r\nscholar you are! An\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I should like to be," said I, glancing at the slate as he held it; with\r\na misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.\r\n\r\n"Why, here\'s a J," said Joe, "and a O equal to anythink! Here\'s a J and\r\na O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe."\r\n\r\nI had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this\r\nmonosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I\r\naccidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit\r\nhis convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing to\r\nembrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I\r\nshould have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, "Ah! But read the\r\nrest, Jo."\r\n\r\n"The rest, eh, Pip?" said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searching eye,\r\n"One, two, three. Why, here\'s three Js, and three Os, and three J-O,\r\nJoes in it, Pip!"\r\n\r\nI leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him the whole\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n"Astonishing!" said Joe, when I had finished. "You ARE a scholar."\r\n\r\n"How do you spell Gargery, Joe?" I asked him, with a modest patronage.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t spell it at all," said Joe.\r\n\r\n"But supposing you did?"\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be supposed," said Joe. "Tho\' I\'m uncommon fond of reading,\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\n"Are you, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"On-common. Give me," said Joe, "a good book, or a good newspaper, and\r\nsit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. Lord!" he continued,\r\nafter rubbing his knees a little, "when you do come to a J and a O, and\r\nsays you, \'Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,\' how interesting reading is!"\r\n\r\nI derived from this, that Joe\'s education, like Steam, was yet in its\r\ninfancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired,--\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?"\r\n\r\n"No, Pip."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?"\r\n\r\n"Well, Pip," said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to\r\nhis usual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire\r\nbetween the lower bars; "I\'ll tell you. My father, Pip, he were given\r\nto drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at\r\nmy mother, most onmerciful. It were a\'most the only hammering he did,\r\nindeed, \'xcepting at myself. And he hammered at me with a wigor only\r\nto be equalled by the wigor with which he didn\'t hammer at his\r\nanwil.--You\'re a listening and understanding, Pip?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Joe."\r\n\r\n"\'Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several\r\ntimes; and then my mother she\'d go out to work, and she\'d say, "Joe,"\r\nshe\'d say, "now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child," and\r\nshe\'d put me to school. But my father were that good in his hart that\r\nhe couldn\'t abear to be without us. So, he\'d come with a most tremenjous\r\ncrowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where we was, that\r\nthey used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us\r\nup to him. And then he took us home and hammered us. Which, you see,\r\nPip," said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of the fire, and\r\nlooking at me, "were a drawback on my learning."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, poor Joe!"\r\n\r\n"Though mind you, Pip," said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the\r\npoker on the top bar, "rendering unto all their doo, and maintaining\r\nequal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in his hart,\r\ndon\'t you see?"\r\n\r\nI didn\'t see; but I didn\'t say so.\r\n\r\n"Well!" Joe pursued, "somebody must keep the pot a biling, Pip, or the\r\npot won\'t bile, don\'t you know?"\r\n\r\nI saw that, and said so.\r\n\r\n"\'Consequence, my father didn\'t make objections to my going to work; so\r\nI went to work at my present calling, which were his too, if he\r\nwould have followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I assure you, Pip.\r\nIn time I were able to keep him, and I kep him till he went off in a\r\npurple leptic fit. And it were my intentions to have had put upon his\r\ntombstone that, Whatsume\'er the failings on his part, Remember reader he\r\nwere that good in his heart."\r\n\r\nJoe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful\r\nperspicuity, that I asked him if he had made it himself.\r\n\r\n"I made it," said Joe, "my own self. I made it in a moment. It was like\r\nstriking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow. I never was so much\r\nsurprised in all my life,--couldn\'t credit my own ed,--to tell you the\r\ntruth, hardly believed it were my own ed. As I was saying, Pip, it were\r\nmy intentions to have had it cut over him; but poetry costs money, cut\r\nit how you will, small or large, and it were not done. Not to mention\r\nbearers, all the money that could be spared were wanted for my mother.\r\nShe were in poor elth, and quite broke. She weren\'t long of following,\r\npoor soul, and her share of peace come round at last."\r\n\r\nJoe\'s blue eyes turned a little watery; he rubbed first one of them, and\r\nthen the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner, with the\r\nround knob on the top of the poker.\r\n\r\n"It were but lonesome then," said Joe, "living here alone, and I got\r\nacquainted with your sister. Now, Pip,"--Joe looked firmly at me as\r\nif he knew I was not going to agree with him;--"your sister is a fine\r\nfigure of a woman."\r\n\r\nI could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.\r\n\r\n"Whatever family opinions, or whatever the world\'s opinions, on that\r\nsubject may be, Pip, your sister is," Joe tapped the top bar with the\r\npoker after every word following, "a-fine-figure--of--a--woman!"\r\n\r\nI could think of nothing better to say than "I am glad you think so,\r\nJoe."\r\n\r\n"So am I," returned Joe, catching me up. "I am glad I think so, Pip. A\r\nlittle redness or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what does it\r\nsignify to Me?"\r\n\r\nI sagaciously observed, if it didn\'t signify to him, to whom did it\r\nsignify?\r\n\r\n"Certainly!" assented Joe. "That\'s it. You\'re right, old chap! When I\r\ngot acquainted with your sister, it were the talk how she was bringing\r\nyou up by hand. Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and I said,\r\nalong with all the folks. As to you," Joe pursued with a countenance\r\nexpressive of seeing something very nasty indeed, "if you could have\r\nbeen aware how small and flabby and mean you was, dear me, you\'d have\r\nformed the most contemptible opinion of yourself!"\r\n\r\nNot exactly relishing this, I said, "Never mind me, Joe."\r\n\r\n"But I did mind you, Pip," he returned with tender simplicity. "When\r\nI offered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked in church at\r\nsuch times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge, I said to\r\nher, \'And bring the poor little child. God bless the poor little child,\'\r\nI said to your sister, \'there\'s room for him at the forge!\'"\r\n\r\nI broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck:\r\nwho dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, "Ever the best of friends;\r\nan\'t us, Pip? Don\'t cry, old chap!"\r\n\r\nWhen this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:--\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, Pip, and here we are! That\'s about where it lights; here\r\nwe are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and I tell\r\nyou beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe mustn\'t see\r\ntoo much of what we\'re up to. It must be done, as I may say, on the sly.\r\nAnd why on the sly? I\'ll tell you why, Pip."\r\n\r\nHe had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he could have\r\nproceeded in his demonstration.\r\n\r\n"Your sister is given to government."\r\n\r\n"Given to government, Joe?" I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea\r\n(and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had divorced her in a favor\r\nof the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.\r\n\r\n"Given to government," said Joe. "Which I meantersay the government of\r\nyou and myself."\r\n\r\n"Oh!"\r\n\r\n"And she an\'t over partial to having scholars on the premises," Joe\r\ncontinued, "and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a\r\nscholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, don\'t you see?"\r\n\r\nI was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as "Why--"\r\nwhen Joe stopped me.\r\n\r\n"Stay a bit. I know what you\'re a going to say, Pip; stay a bit! I don\'t\r\ndeny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us, now and again. I don\'t\r\ndeny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do drop down upon us\r\nheavy. At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page, Pip," Joe\r\nsank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, "candor compels fur\r\nto admit that she is a Buster."\r\n\r\nJoe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital\r\nBs.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off, Pip?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Joe."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Joe, passing the poker in to his left hand, that he might\r\nfeel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that\r\nplacid occupation; "your sister\'s a master-mind. A master-mind."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand. But\r\nJoe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completely\r\nstopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look,\r\n"Her."\r\n\r\n"And I ain\'t a master-mind," Joe resumed, when he had unfixed his look,\r\nand got back to his whisker. "And last of all, Pip,--and this I want to\r\nsay very serious to you, old chap,--I see so much in my poor mother,\r\nof a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never\r\ngetting no peace in her mortal days, that I\'m dead afeerd of going wrong\r\nin the way of not doing what\'s right by a woman, and I\'d fur rather\r\nof the two go wrong the t\'other way, and be a little ill-conwenienced\r\nmyself. I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I wish there warn\'t\r\nno Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it all on myself;\r\nbut this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and I hope you\'ll\r\noverlook shortcomings."\r\n\r\nYoung as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from that\r\nnight. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but, afterwards\r\nat quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about him, I had\r\na new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up to Joe in my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"However," said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; "here\'s the\r\nDutch-clock a working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of \'em,\r\nand she\'s not come home yet! I hope Uncle Pumblechook\'s mare mayn\'t have\r\nset a forefoot on a piece o\' ice, and gone down."\r\n\r\nMrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days,\r\nto assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a\r\nwoman\'s judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no\r\nconfidences in his domestic servant. This was market-day, and Mrs. Joe\r\nwas out on one of these expeditions.\r\n\r\nJoe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to\r\nlisten for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew\r\nkeenly, and the frost was white and hard. A man would die to-night of\r\nlying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I looked at the stars, and\r\nconsidered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to them\r\nas he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering\r\nmultitude.\r\n\r\n"Here comes the mare," said Joe, "ringing like a peal of bells!"\r\n\r\nThe sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as she\r\ncame along at a much brisker trot than usual. We got a chair out, ready\r\nfor Mrs. Joe\'s alighting, and stirred up the fire that they might see a\r\nbright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might\r\nbe out of its place. When we had completed these preparations, they\r\ndrove up, wrapped to the eyes. Mrs. Joe was soon landed, and Uncle\r\nPumblechook was soon down too, covering the mare with a cloth, and we\r\nwere soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold air in with us that\r\nit seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, and\r\nthrowing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings,\r\n"if this boy ain\'t grateful this night, he never will be!"\r\n\r\nI looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was wholly\r\nuninformed why he ought to assume that expression.\r\n\r\n"It\'s only to be hoped," said my sister, "that he won\'t be Pompeyed. But\r\nI have my fears."\r\n\r\n"She ain\'t in that line, Mum," said Mr. Pumblechook. "She knows better."\r\n\r\nShe? I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows,\r\n"She?" Joe looked at me, making the motion with his lips and eyebrows,\r\n"She?" My sister catching him in the act, he drew the back of his hand\r\nacross his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such occasions, and\r\nlooked at her.\r\n\r\n"Well?" said my sister, in her snappish way. "What are you staring at?\r\nIs the house afire?"\r\n\r\n"--Which some individual," Joe politely hinted, "mentioned--she."\r\n\r\n"And she is a she, I suppose?" said my sister. "Unless you call Miss\r\nHavisham a he. And I doubt if even you\'ll go so far as that."\r\n\r\n"Miss Havisham, up town?" said Joe.\r\n\r\n"Is there any Miss Havisham down town?" returned my sister.\r\n\r\n"She wants this boy to go and play there. And of course he\'s going. And\r\nhe had better play there," said my sister, shaking her head at me as an\r\nencouragement to be extremely light and sportive, "or I\'ll work him."\r\n\r\nI had heard of Miss Havisham up town,--everybody for miles round had\r\nheard of Miss Havisham up town,--as an immensely rich and grim lady who\r\nlived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers, and who\r\nled a life of seclusion.\r\n\r\n"Well to be sure!" said Joe, astounded. "I wonder how she come to know\r\nPip!"\r\n\r\n"Noodle!" cried my sister. "Who said she knew him?"\r\n\r\n"--Which some individual," Joe again politely hinted, "mentioned that\r\nshe wanted him to go and play there."\r\n\r\n"And couldn\'t she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and\r\nplay there? Isn\'t it just barely possible that Uncle Pumblechook may be\r\na tenant of hers, and that he may sometimes--we won\'t say quarterly\r\nor half-yearly, for that would be requiring too much of you--but\r\nsometimes--go there to pay his rent? And couldn\'t she then ask Uncle\r\nPumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there? And couldn\'t Uncle\r\nPumblechook, being always considerate and thoughtful for us--though you\r\nmay not think it, Joseph," in a tone of the deepest reproach, as if\r\nhe were the most callous of nephews, "then mention this boy, standing\r\nPrancing here"--which I solemnly declare I was not doing--"that I have\r\nfor ever been a willing slave to?"\r\n\r\n"Good again!" cried Uncle Pumblechook. "Well put! Prettily pointed! Good\r\nindeed! Now Joseph, you know the case."\r\n\r\n"No, Joseph," said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while Joe\r\napologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose,\r\n"you do not yet--though you may not think it--know the case. You may\r\nconsider that you do, but you do not, Joseph. For you do not know that\r\nUncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything we can tell, this\r\nboy\'s fortune may be made by his going to Miss Havisham\'s, has offered\r\nto take him into town to-night in his own chaise-cart, and to keep\r\nhim to-night, and to take him with his own hands to Miss Havisham\'s\r\nto-morrow morning. And Lor-a-mussy me!" cried my sister, casting off her\r\nbonnet in sudden desperation, "here I stand talking to mere Mooncalfs,\r\nwith Uncle Pumblechook waiting, and the mare catching cold at the door,\r\nand the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of his head to the\r\nsole of his foot!"\r\n\r\nWith that, she pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and my face was\r\nsqueezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head was put under taps of\r\nwater-butts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, and towelled, and thumped,\r\nand harrowed, and rasped, until I really was quite beside myself. (I\r\nmay here remark that I suppose myself to be better acquainted than\r\nany living authority, with the ridgy effect of a wedding-ring, passing\r\nunsympathetically over the human countenance.)\r\n\r\nWhen my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of the\r\nstiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was\r\ntrussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit. I was then delivered\r\nover to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were the\r\nSheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been\r\ndying to make all along: "Boy, be forever grateful to all friends, but\r\nespecially unto them which brought you up by hand!"\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Joe!"\r\n\r\n"God bless you, Pip, old chap!"\r\n\r\nI had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings and what\r\nwith soapsuds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart.\r\nBut they twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on the\r\nquestions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havisham\'s, and what\r\non earth I was expected to play at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook\'s premises in the High Street of the market town,\r\nwere of a peppercorny and farinaceous character, as the premises of a\r\ncornchandler and seedsman should be. It appeared to me that he must be a\r\nvery happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop; and\r\nI wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and saw the\r\ntied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds and bulbs\r\never wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and bloom.\r\n\r\nIt was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this\r\nspeculation. On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in\r\nan attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the\r\nbedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my\r\neyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity\r\nbetween seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did\r\nhis shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavor about the\r\ncorduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and flavor\r\nabout the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I hardly knew\r\nwhich was which. The same opportunity served me for noticing that Mr.\r\nPumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the\r\nstreet at the saddler, who appeared to transact his business by keeping\r\nhis eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to get on in life by putting his\r\nhands in his pockets and contemplating the baker, who in his turn folded\r\nhis arms and stared at the grocer, who stood at his door and yawned at\r\nthe chemist. The watchmaker, always poring over a little desk with\r\na magnifying-glass at his eye, and always inspected by a group of\r\nsmock-frocks poring over him through the glass of his shop-window,\r\nseemed to be about the only person in the High Street whose trade\r\nengaged his attention.\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o\'clock in the parlor behind\r\nthe shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread\r\nand butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered Mr.\r\nPumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my sister\'s\r\nidea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted\r\nto my diet,--besides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination\r\nwith as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm water into\r\nmy milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out\r\naltogether,--his conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic. On\r\nmy politely bidding him Good morning, he said, pompously, "Seven times\r\nnine, boy?" And how should I be able to answer, dodged in that way, in\r\na strange place, on an empty stomach! I was hungry, but before I had\r\nswallowed a morsel, he began a running sum that lasted all through the\r\nbreakfast. "Seven?" "And four?" "And eight?" "And six?" "And two?" "And\r\nten?" And so on. And after each figure was disposed of, it was as much\r\nas I could do to get a bite or a sup, before the next came; while he sat\r\nat his ease guessing nothing, and eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I\r\nmay be allowed the expression) a gorging and gormandizing manner.\r\n\r\nFor such reasons, I was very glad when ten o\'clock came and we started\r\nfor Miss Havisham\'s; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the\r\nmanner in which I should acquit myself under that lady\'s roof. Within\r\na quarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham\'s house, which was of old\r\nbrick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it. Some of the\r\nwindows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower were\r\nrustily barred. There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; so\r\nwe had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come\r\nto open it. While we waited at the gate, I peeped in (even then Mr.\r\nPumblechook said, "And fourteen?" but I pretended not to hear him), and\r\nsaw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery. No brewing\r\nwas going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nA window was raised, and a clear voice demanded "What name?" To which my\r\nconductor replied, "Pumblechook." The voice returned, "Quite right," and\r\nthe window was shut again, and a young lady came across the court-yard,\r\nwith keys in her hand.\r\n\r\n"This," said Mr. Pumblechook, "is Pip."\r\n\r\n"This is Pip, is it?" returned the young lady, who was very pretty and\r\nseemed very proud; "come in, Pip."\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with the gate.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she said. "Did you wish to see Miss Havisham?"\r\n\r\n"If Miss Havisham wished to see me," returned Mr. Pumblechook,\r\ndiscomfited.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said the girl; "but you see she don\'t."\r\n\r\nShe said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.\r\nPumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not\r\nprotest. But he eyed me severely,--as if I had done anything to\r\nhim!--and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: "Boy! Let\r\nyour behavior here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand!"\r\nI was not free from apprehension that he would come back to propound\r\nthrough the gate, "And sixteen?" But he didn\'t.\r\n\r\nMy young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard.\r\nIt was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice. The\r\nbrewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the\r\nwooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stood\r\nopen, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.\r\nThe cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate; and\r\nit made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the\r\nbrewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.\r\n\r\nShe saw me looking at it, and she said, "You could drink without hurt\r\nall the strong beer that\'s brewed there now, boy."\r\n\r\n"I should think I could, miss," said I, in a shy way.\r\n\r\n"Better not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, boy;\r\ndon\'t you think so?"\r\n\r\n"It looks like it, miss."\r\n\r\n"Not that anybody means to try," she added, "for that\'s all done with,\r\nand the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls. As to strong\r\nbeer, there\'s enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the Manor\r\nHouse."\r\n\r\n"Is that the name of this house, miss?"\r\n\r\n"One of its names, boy."\r\n\r\n"It has more than one, then, miss?"\r\n\r\n"One more. Its other name was Satis; which is Greek, or Latin, or\r\nHebrew, or all three--or all one to me--for enough."\r\n\r\n"Enough House," said I; "that\'s a curious name, miss."\r\n\r\n"Yes," she replied; "but it meant more than it said. It meant, when it\r\nwas given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else. They\r\nmust have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think. But don\'t\r\nloiter, boy."\r\n\r\nThough she called me "boy" so often, and with a carelessness that was\r\nfar from complimentary, she was of about my own age. She seemed much\r\nolder than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful and self-possessed;\r\nand she was as scornful of me as if she had been one-and-twenty, and a\r\nqueen.\r\n\r\nWe went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had two\r\nchains across it outside,--and the first thing I noticed was, that the\r\npassages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.\r\nShe took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase,\r\nand still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.\r\n\r\nAt last we came to the door of a room, and she said, "Go in."\r\n\r\nI answered, more in shyness than politeness, "After you, miss."\r\n\r\nTo this she returned: "Don\'t be ridiculous, boy; I am not going in." And\r\nscornfully walked away, and--what was worse--took the candle with her.\r\n\r\nThis was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the only\r\nthing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told\r\nfrom within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a pretty\r\nlarge room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of daylight was to\r\nbe seen in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposed from the furniture,\r\nthough much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me. But\r\nprominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking-glass, and that\r\nI made out at first sight to be a fine lady\'s dressing-table.\r\n\r\nWhether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no\r\nfine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an arm-chair, with an\r\nelbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat the\r\nstrangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in rich materials,--satins, and lace, and silks,--all\r\nof white. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent\r\nfrom her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was\r\nwhite. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and\r\nsome other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid\r\nthan the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about.\r\nShe had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,--the\r\nother was on the table near her hand,--her veil was but half arranged,\r\nher watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay\r\nwith those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and\r\nsome flowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the\r\nlooking-glass.\r\n\r\nIt was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though\r\nI saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I\r\nsaw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been\r\nwhite long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw\r\nthat the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and\r\nlike the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her\r\nsunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure\r\nof a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had\r\nshrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly\r\nwaxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage\r\nlying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches\r\nto see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of\r\na vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to\r\nhave dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if\r\nI could.\r\n\r\n"Who is it?" said the lady at the table.\r\n\r\n"Pip, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Pip?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Pumblechook\'s boy, ma\'am. Come--to play."\r\n\r\n"Come nearer; let me look at you. Come close."\r\n\r\nIt was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of\r\nthe surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped\r\nat twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at\r\ntwenty minutes to nine.\r\n\r\n"Look at me," said Miss Havisham. "You are not afraid of a woman who has\r\nnever seen the sun since you were born?"\r\n\r\nI regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie\r\ncomprehended in the answer "No."\r\n\r\n"Do you know what I touch here?" she said, laying her hands, one upon\r\nthe other, on her left side.\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am." (It made me think of the young man.)\r\n\r\n"What do I touch?"\r\n\r\n"Your heart."\r\n\r\n"Broken!"\r\n\r\nShe uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and\r\nwith a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards she kept\r\nher hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if they\r\nwere heavy.\r\n\r\n"I am tired," said Miss Havisham. "I want diversion, and I have done\r\nwith men and women. Play."\r\n\r\nI think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she\r\ncould hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide\r\nworld more difficult to be done under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n"I sometimes have sick fancies," she went on, "and I have a sick fancy\r\nthat I want to see some play. There, there!" with an impatient movement\r\nof the fingers of her right hand; "play, play, play!"\r\n\r\nFor a moment, with the fear of my sister\'s working me before my eyes, I\r\nhad a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character\r\nof Mr. Pumblechook\'s chaise-cart. But I felt myself so unequal to the\r\nperformance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Miss Havisham in\r\nwhat I suppose she took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as she said, when\r\nwe had taken a good look at each other,--\r\n\r\n"Are you sullen and obstinate?"\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can\'t play just\r\nnow. If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, so\r\nI would do it if I could; but it\'s so new here, and so strange, and so\r\nfine,--and melancholy--." I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or\r\nhad already said it, and we took another look at each other.\r\n\r\nBefore she spoke again, she turned her eyes from me, and looked at the\r\ndress she wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself in the\r\nlooking-glass.\r\n\r\n"So new to him," she muttered, "so old to me; so strange to him, so\r\nfamiliar to me; so melancholy to both of us! Call Estella."\r\n\r\nAs she was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she was\r\nstill talking to herself, and kept quiet.\r\n\r\n"Call Estella," she repeated, flashing a look at me. "You can do that.\r\nCall Estella. At the door."\r\n\r\nTo stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house,\r\nbawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive,\r\nand feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name, was almost\r\nas bad as playing to order. But she answered at last, and her light came\r\nalong the dark passage like a star.\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from the\r\ntable, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her\r\npretty brown hair. "Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use it\r\nwell. Let me see you play cards with this boy."\r\n\r\n"With this boy? Why, he is a common laboring boy!"\r\n\r\nI thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,--only it seemed so\r\nunlikely,--"Well? You can break his heart."\r\n\r\n"What do you play, boy?" asked Estella of myself, with the greatest\r\ndisdain.\r\n\r\n"Nothing but beggar my neighbor, miss."\r\n\r\n"Beggar him," said Miss Havisham to Estella. So we sat down to cards.\r\n\r\nIt was then I began to understand that everything in the room had\r\nstopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed that\r\nMiss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had\r\ntaken it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the dressing-table\r\nagain, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now yellow, had never\r\nbeen worn. I glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent,\r\nand saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now yellow, had been\r\ntrodden ragged. Without this arrest of everything, this standing still\r\nof all the pale decayed objects, not even the withered bridal dress on\r\nthe collapsed form could have looked so like grave-clothes, or the long\r\nveil so like a shroud.\r\n\r\nSo she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and\r\ntrimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knew nothing\r\nthen of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in\r\nancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly\r\nseen; but, I have often thought since, that she must have looked as if\r\nthe admission of the natural light of day would have struck her to dust.\r\n\r\n"He calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!" said Estella with disdain, before\r\nour first game was out. "And what coarse hands he has! And what thick\r\nboots!"\r\n\r\nI had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began\r\nto consider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so\r\nstrong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.\r\n\r\nShe won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as was only natural, when I\r\nknew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she denounced me for\r\na stupid, clumsy laboring-boy.\r\n\r\n"You say nothing of her," remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she looked\r\non. "She says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her. What\r\ndo you think of her?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to say," I stammered.\r\n\r\n"Tell me in my ear," said Miss Havisham, bending down.\r\n\r\n"I think she is very proud," I replied, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n"Anything else?"\r\n\r\n"I think she is very pretty."\r\n\r\n"Anything else?"\r\n\r\n"I think she is very insulting." (She was looking at me then with a look\r\nof supreme aversion.)\r\n\r\n"Anything else?"\r\n\r\n"I think I should like to go home."\r\n\r\n"And never see her again, though she is so pretty?"\r\n\r\n"I am not sure that I shouldn\'t like to see her again, but I should like\r\nto go home now."\r\n\r\n"You shall go soon," said Miss Havisham, aloud. "Play the game out."\r\n\r\nSaving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost\r\nsure that Miss Havisham\'s face could not smile. It had dropped into a\r\nwatchful and brooding expression,--most likely when all the things about\r\nher had become transfixed,--and it looked as if nothing could ever lift\r\nit up again. Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped; and her voice\r\nhad dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her;\r\naltogether, she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul,\r\nwithin and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.\r\n\r\nI played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me. She\r\nthrew the cards down on the table when she had won them all, as if she\r\ndespised them for having been won of me.\r\n\r\n"When shall I have you here again?" said Miss Havisham. "Let me think."\r\n\r\nI was beginning to remind her that to-day was Wednesday, when she\r\nchecked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her\r\nright hand.\r\n\r\n"There, there! I know nothing of days of the week; I know nothing of\r\nweeks of the year. Come again after six days. You hear?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Estella, take him down. Let him have something to eat, and let him roam\r\nand look about him while he eats. Go, Pip."\r\n\r\nI followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and she\r\nstood it in the place where we had found it. Until she opened the\r\nside entrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must\r\nnecessarily be night-time. The rush of the daylight quite confounded me,\r\nand made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange room\r\nmany hours.\r\n\r\n"You are to wait here, you boy," said Estella; and disappeared and\r\nclosed the door.\r\n\r\nI took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my\r\ncoarse hands and my common boots. My opinion of those accessories was\r\nnot favorable. They had never troubled me before, but they troubled\r\nme now, as vulgar appendages. I determined to ask Joe why he had ever\r\ntaught me to call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be called\r\nknaves. I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and then\r\nI should have been so too.\r\n\r\nShe came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer. She\r\nput the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread\r\nand meat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in\r\ndisgrace. I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,--I\r\ncannot hit upon the right name for the smart--God knows what its name\r\nwas,--that tears started to my eyes. The moment they sprang there, the\r\ngirl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them.\r\nThis gave me power to keep them back and to look at her: so, she gave a\r\ncontemptuous toss--but with a sense, I thought, of having made too sure\r\nthat I was so wounded--and left me.\r\n\r\nBut when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face\r\nin, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my\r\nsleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.\r\nAs I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; so\r\nbitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name, that\r\nneeded counteraction.\r\n\r\nMy sister\'s bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world in\r\nwhich children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is\r\nnothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice. It may be\r\nonly small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child\r\nis small, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as many\r\nhands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter. Within\r\nmyself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with\r\ninjustice. I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my\r\nsister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me. I had\r\ncherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave her\r\nno right to bring me up by jerks. Through all my punishments, disgraces,\r\nfasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had nursed\r\nthis assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in a solitary and\r\nunprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I was morally timid\r\nand very sensitive.\r\n\r\nI got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the\r\nbrewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my\r\nface with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate. The bread and meat\r\nwere acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon\r\nin spirits to look about me.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the\r\nbrewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high\r\nwind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there\r\nhad been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were no pigeons\r\nin the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty, no malt in\r\nthe storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat.\r\nAll the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its\r\nlast reek of smoke. In a by-yard, there was a wilderness of empty casks,\r\nwhich had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about\r\nthem; but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that\r\nwas gone,--and in this respect I remember those recluses as being like\r\nmost others.\r\n\r\nBehind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old\r\nwall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough\r\nto look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the\r\nhouse, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was\r\na track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes walked\r\nthere, and that Estella was walking away from me even then. But she\r\nseemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation presented\r\nby the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw her walking on them at\r\nthe end of the yard of casks. She had her back towards me, and held her\r\npretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and never looked round,\r\nand passed out of my view directly. So, in the brewery itself,--by which\r\nI mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer,\r\nand where the brewing utensils still were. When I first went into it,\r\nand, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the door looking about\r\nme, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, and ascend some light\r\niron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead, as if she were going\r\nout into the sky.\r\n\r\nIt was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened\r\nto my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a\r\nstranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes--a little dimmed by\r\nlooking up at the frosty light--towards a great wooden beam in a low\r\nnook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure\r\nhanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but\r\none shoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded\r\ntrimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was\r\nMiss Havisham\'s, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if\r\nshe were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure,\r\nand in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment\r\nbefore, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terror\r\nwas greatest of all when I found no figure there.\r\n\r\nNothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of\r\npeople passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving\r\ninfluence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have brought\r\nme round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself as soon\r\nas I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to let\r\nme out. She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I\r\nthought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.\r\n\r\nShe gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced that\r\nmy hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she opened the\r\ngate, and stood holding it. I was passing out without looking at her,\r\nwhen she touched me with a taunting hand.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you cry?"\r\n\r\n"Because I don\'t want to."\r\n\r\n"You do," said she. "You have been crying till you are half blind, and\r\nyou are near crying again now."\r\n\r\nShe laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me.\r\nI went straight to Mr. Pumblechook\'s, and was immensely relieved to find\r\nhim not at home. So, leaving word with the shopman on what day I was\r\nwanted at Miss Havisham\'s again, I set off on the four-mile walk to\r\nour forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply\r\nrevolving that I was a common laboring-boy; that my hands were coarse;\r\nthat my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit\r\nof calling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I had\r\nconsidered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-lived\r\nbad way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\nWhen I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about Miss\r\nHavisham\'s, and asked a number of questions. And I soon found myself\r\ngetting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small\r\nof the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen\r\nwall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficient length.\r\n\r\nIf a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other\r\nyoung people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden\r\nin mine,--which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason\r\nto suspect myself of having been a monstrosity,--it is the key to many\r\nreservations. I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham\'s as my\r\neyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Not only that, but I felt\r\nconvinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; and although\r\nshe was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an impression\r\nthat there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging\r\nher as she really was (to say nothing of Miss Estella) before the\r\ncontemplation of Mrs. Joe. Consequently, I said as little as I could,\r\nand had my face shoved against the kitchen wall.\r\n\r\nThe worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon by\r\na devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, came\r\ngaping over in his chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the details divulged\r\nto him. And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyes and mouth\r\nopen, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoat heaving\r\nwith windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.\r\n\r\n"Well, boy," Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated in the\r\nchair of honor by the fire. "How did you get on up town?"\r\n\r\nI answered, "Pretty well, sir," and my sister shook her fist at me.\r\n\r\n"Pretty well?" Mr. Pumblechook repeated. "Pretty well is no answer. Tell\r\nus what you mean by pretty well, boy?"\r\n\r\nWhitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy\r\nperhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, my\r\nobstinacy was adamantine. I reflected for some time, and then answered\r\nas if I had discovered a new idea, "I mean pretty well."\r\n\r\nMy sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,--I\r\nhad no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,--when Mr.\r\nPumblechook interposed with "No! Don\'t lose your temper. Leave this\r\nlad to me, ma\'am; leave this lad to me." Mr. Pumblechook then turned me\r\ntowards him, as if he were going to cut my hair, and said,--\r\n\r\n"First (to get our thoughts in order): Forty-three pence?"\r\n\r\nI calculated the consequences of replying "Four Hundred Pound," and\r\nfinding them against me, went as near the answer as I could--which was\r\nsomewhere about eightpence off. Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my\r\npence-table from "twelve pence make one shilling," up to "forty pence\r\nmake three and fourpence," and then triumphantly demanded, as if he had\r\ndone for me, "Now! How much is forty-three pence?" To which I replied,\r\nafter a long interval of reflection, "I don\'t know." And I was so\r\naggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me,\r\nand said, "Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for\r\ninstance?"\r\n\r\n"Yes!" said I. And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it was\r\nhighly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke, and\r\nbrought him to a dead stop.\r\n\r\n"Boy! What like is Miss Havisham?" Mr. Pumblechook began again when\r\nhe had recovered; folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the\r\nscrew.\r\n\r\n"Very tall and dark," I told him.\r\n\r\n"Is she, uncle?" asked my sister.\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that he had\r\nnever seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the kind.\r\n\r\n"Good!" said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly. ("This is the way to have him!\r\nWe are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?")\r\n\r\n"I am sure, uncle," returned Mrs. Joe, "I wish you had him always; you\r\nknow so well how to deal with him."\r\n\r\n"Now, boy! What was she a doing of, when you went in today?" asked Mr.\r\nPumblechook.\r\n\r\n"She was sitting," I answered, "in a black velvet coach."\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another--as they well\r\nmight--and both repeated, "In a black velvet coach?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said I. "And Miss Estella--that\'s her niece, I think--handed her\r\nin cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate. And we all had\r\ncake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eat mine,\r\nbecause she told me to."\r\n\r\n"Was anybody else there?" asked Mr. Pumblechook.\r\n\r\n"Four dogs," said I.\r\n\r\n"Large or small?"\r\n\r\n"Immense," said I. "And they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silver\r\nbasket."\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utter\r\namazement. I was perfectly frantic,--a reckless witness under the\r\ntorture,--and would have told them anything.\r\n\r\n"Where was this coach, in the name of gracious?" asked my sister.\r\n\r\n"In Miss Havisham\'s room." They stared again. "But there weren\'t any\r\nhorses to it." I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting\r\nfour richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of\r\nharnessing.\r\n\r\n"Can this be possible, uncle?" asked Mrs. Joe. "What can the boy mean?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you, Mum," said Mr. Pumblechook. "My opinion is, it\'s a\r\nsedan-chair. She\'s flighty, you know,--very flighty,--quite flighty\r\nenough to pass her days in a sedan-chair."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see her in it, uncle?" asked Mrs. Joe.\r\n\r\n"How could I," he returned, forced to the admission, "when I never see\r\nher in my life? Never clapped eyes upon her!"\r\n\r\n"Goodness, uncle! And yet you have spoken to her?"\r\n\r\n"Why, don\'t you know," said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, "that when I have\r\nbeen there, I have been took up to the outside of her door, and the door\r\nhas stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way. Don\'t say you don\'t\r\nknow that, Mum. Howsever, the boy went there to play. What did you play\r\nat, boy?"\r\n\r\n"We played with flags," I said. (I beg to observe that I think of myself\r\nwith amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)\r\n\r\n"Flags!" echoed my sister.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said I. "Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and\r\nMiss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out\r\nat the coach-window. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed."\r\n\r\n"Swords!" repeated my sister. "Where did you get swords from?"\r\n\r\n"Out of a cupboard," said I. "And I saw pistols in it,--and jam,--and\r\npills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up\r\nwith candles."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true, Mum," said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. "That\'s the\r\nstate of the case, for that much I\'ve seen myself." And then they\r\nboth stared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my\r\ncountenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers\r\nwith my right hand.\r\n\r\nIf they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly have\r\nbetrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that\r\nthere was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement\r\nbut for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear\r\nin the brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the\r\nmarvels I had already presented for their consideration, that I escaped.\r\nThe subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to have a cup\r\nof tea. To whom my sister, more for the relief of her own mind than for\r\nthe gratification of his, related my pretended experiences.\r\n\r\nNow, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the\r\nkitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only as\r\nregarded him,--not in the least as regarded the other two. Towards\r\nJoe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat\r\ndebating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham\'s acquaintance\r\nand favor. They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would "do something"\r\nfor me; their doubts related to the form that something would take.\r\nMy sister stood out for "property." Mr. Pumblechook was in favor of a\r\nhandsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel trade,--say,\r\nthe corn and seed trade, for instance. Joe fell into the deepest\r\ndisgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I might only\r\nbe presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the veal-cutlets.\r\n"If a fool\'s head can\'t express better opinions than that," said my\r\nsister, "and you have got any work to do, you had better go and do it."\r\nSo he went.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washing up,\r\nI stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him until he had done for\r\nthe night. Then I said, "Before the fire goes out, Joe, I should like to\r\ntell you something."\r\n\r\n"Should you, Pip?" said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge.\r\n"Then tell us. What is it, Pip?"\r\n\r\n"Joe," said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting\r\nit between my finger and thumb, "you remember all that about Miss\r\nHavisham\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Remember?" said Joe. "I believe you! Wonderful!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a terrible thing, Joe; it ain\'t true."\r\n\r\n"What are you telling of, Pip?" cried Joe, falling back in the greatest\r\namazement. "You don\'t mean to say it\'s--"\r\n\r\n"Yes I do; it\'s lies, Joe."\r\n\r\n"But not all of it? Why sure you don\'t mean to say, Pip, that there was\r\nno black welwet co--eh?" For, I stood shaking my head. "But at least\r\nthere was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip," said Joe, persuasively, "if there\r\nwarn\'t no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?"\r\n\r\n"No, Joe."\r\n\r\n"A dog?" said Joe. "A puppy? Come?"\r\n\r\n"No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind."\r\n\r\nAs I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.\r\n"Pip, old chap! This won\'t do, old fellow! I say! Where do you expect to\r\ngo to?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s terrible, Joe; ain\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Terrible?" cried Joe. "Awful! What possessed you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what possessed me, Joe," I replied, letting his shirt\r\nsleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head;\r\n"but I wish you hadn\'t taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I\r\nwish my boots weren\'t so thick nor my hands so coarse."\r\n\r\nAnd then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn\'t been\r\nable to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to\r\nme, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham\'s\r\nwho was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that I\r\nknew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the lies\r\nhad come of it somehow, though I didn\'t know how.\r\n\r\nThis was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal\r\nwith as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of\r\nmetaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.\r\n\r\n"There\'s one thing you may be sure of, Pip," said Joe, after some\r\nrumination, "namely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they didn\'t\r\nought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to\r\nthe same. Don\'t you tell no more of \'em, Pip. That ain\'t the way to get\r\nout of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I don\'t make\r\nit out at all clear. You are oncommon in some things. You\'re oncommon\r\nsmall. Likewise you\'re a oncommon scholar."\r\n\r\n"No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe."\r\n\r\n"Why, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! I\'ve\r\nseen letters--Ah! and from gentlefolks!--that I\'ll swear weren\'t wrote\r\nin print," said Joe.\r\n\r\n"I have learnt next to nothing, Joe. You think much of me. It\'s only\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Well, Pip," said Joe, "be it so or be it son\'t, you must be a common\r\nscholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! The king upon\r\nhis throne, with his crown upon his ed, can\'t sit and write his acts\r\nof Parliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromoted\r\nPrince, with the alphabet.--Ah!" added Joe, with a shake of the head\r\nthat was full of meaning, "and begun at A too, and worked his way to Z.\r\nAnd I know what that is to do, though I can\'t say I\'ve exactly done it."\r\n\r\nThere was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged\r\nme.\r\n\r\n"Whether common ones as to callings and earnings," pursued Joe,\r\nreflectively, "mightn\'t be the better of continuing for to keep\r\ncompany with common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon\r\nones,--which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?"\r\n\r\n"No, Joe."\r\n\r\n"(I\'m sorry there weren\'t a flag, Pip). Whether that might be or\r\nmightn\'t be, is a thing as can\'t be looked into now, without putting\r\nyour sister on the Rampage; and that\'s a thing not to be thought of as\r\nbeing done intentional. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by a\r\ntrue friend. Which this to you the true friend say. If you can\'t get to\r\nbe oncommon through going straight, you\'ll never get to do it through\r\ngoing crooked. So don\'t tell no more on \'em, Pip, and live well and die\r\nhappy."\r\n\r\n"You are not angry with me, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"No, old chap. But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay\r\nof a stunning and outdacious sort,--alluding to them which bordered on\r\nweal-cutlets and dog-fighting,--a sincere well-wisher would adwise, Pip,\r\ntheir being dropped into your meditations, when you go upstairs to bed.\r\nThat\'s all, old chap, and don\'t never do it no more."\r\n\r\nWhen I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not forget\r\nJoe\'s recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and\r\nunthankful state, that I thought long after I laid me down, how common\r\nEstella would consider Joe, a mere blacksmith; how thick his boots, and\r\nhow coarse his hands. I thought how Joe and my sister were then sitting\r\nin the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and how\r\nMiss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen, but were far above the\r\nlevel of such common doings. I fell asleep recalling what I "used to\r\ndo" when I was at Miss Havisham\'s; as though I had been there weeks or\r\nmonths, instead of hours; and as though it were quite an old subject of\r\nremembrance, instead of one that had arisen only that day.\r\n\r\nThat was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But it\r\nis the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out of it,\r\nand think how different its course would have been. Pause you who read\r\nthis, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold,\r\nof thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the\r\nformation of the first link on one memorable day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\nThe felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke,\r\nthat the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to\r\nget out of Biddy everything she knew. In pursuance of this luminous\r\nconception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle\'s great-aunt\'s\r\nat night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life,\r\nand that I should feel very much obliged to her if she would impart\r\nall her learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging of girls,\r\nimmediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out her promise\r\nwithin five minutes.\r\n\r\nThe Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle\'s great-aunt\r\nmay be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples\r\nand put straws down one another\'s backs, until Mr. Wopsle\'s great-aunt\r\ncollected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with\r\na birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision, the\r\npupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to\r\nhand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and\r\na little spelling,--that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this\r\nvolume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle\'s great-aunt fell into a state of\r\ncoma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils then\r\nentered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject\r\nof Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon\r\nwhose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a rush at\r\nthem and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they had been\r\nunskilfully cut off the chump end of something), more illegibly printed\r\nat the best than any curiosities of literature I have since met with,\r\nspeckled all over with ironmould, and having various specimens of the\r\ninsect world smashed between their leaves. This part of the Course was\r\nusually lightened by several single combats between Biddy and refractory\r\nstudents. When the fights were over, Biddy gave out the number of a\r\npage, and then we all read aloud what we could,--or what we couldn\'t--in\r\na frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high, shrill, monotonous voice,\r\nand none of us having the least notion of, or reverence for, what we\r\nwere reading about. When this horrible din had lasted a certain time,\r\nit mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle\'s great-aunt, who staggered at a boy\r\nfortuitously, and pulled his ears. This was understood to terminate\r\nthe Course for the evening, and we emerged into the air with shrieks of\r\nintellectual victory. It is fair to remark that there was no prohibition\r\nagainst any pupil\'s entertaining himself with a slate or even with the\r\nink (when there was any), but that it was not easy to pursue that branch\r\nof study in the winter season, on account of the little general shop\r\nin which the classes were holden--and which was also Mr. Wopsle\'s\r\ngreat-aunt\'s sitting-room and bedchamber--being but faintly illuminated\r\nthrough the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle and no snuffers.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under\r\nthese circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that\r\nvery evening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some\r\ninformation from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head of moist\r\nsugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D which she\r\nhad imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which I supposed,\r\nuntil she told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle.\r\n\r\nOf course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joe\r\nliked sometimes to smoke his pipe there. I had received strict orders\r\nfrom my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen, that\r\nevening, on my way from school, and bring him home at my peril. To the\r\nThree Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.\r\n\r\nThere was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalk\r\nscores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to\r\nbe never paid off. They had been there ever since I could remember, and\r\nhad grown more than I had. But there was a quantity of chalk about our\r\ncountry, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it\r\nto account.\r\n\r\nIt being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly\r\nat these records; but as my business was with Joe and not with him, I\r\nmerely wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at the\r\nend of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire,\r\nand where Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a\r\nstranger. Joe greeted me as usual with "Halloa, Pip, old chap!" and the\r\nmoment he said that, the stranger turned his head and looked at me.\r\n\r\nHe was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His head was\r\nall on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were\r\ntaking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in his\r\nmouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away\r\nand looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then he\r\nnodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit\r\ndown there.\r\n\r\nBut as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of\r\nresort, I said "No, thank you, sir," and fell into the space Joe made\r\nfor me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,\r\nand seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again\r\nwhen I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg--in a very odd way, as\r\nit struck me.\r\n\r\n"You was saying," said the strange man, turning to Joe, "that you was a\r\nblacksmith."\r\n\r\n"Yes. I said it, you know," said Joe.\r\n\r\n"What\'ll you drink, Mr.--? You didn\'t mention your name, by the bye."\r\n\r\nJoe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it. "What\'ll you\r\ndrink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Joe, "to tell you the truth, I ain\'t much in the habit of\r\ndrinking at anybody\'s expense but my own."\r\n\r\n"Habit? No," returned the stranger, "but once and away, and on a\r\nSaturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t wish to be stiff company," said Joe. "Rum."\r\n\r\n"Rum," repeated the stranger. "And will the other gentleman originate a\r\nsentiment."\r\n\r\n"Rum," said Mr. Wopsle.\r\n\r\n"Three Rums!" cried the stranger, calling to the landlord. "Glasses\r\nround!"\r\n\r\n"This other gentleman," observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,\r\n"is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk at\r\nchurch."\r\n\r\n"Aha!" said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. "The\r\nlonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s it," said Joe.\r\n\r\nThe stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put\r\nhis legs up on the settle that he had to himself. He wore a flapping\r\nbroad-brimmed traveller\'s hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over his\r\nhead in the manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair. As he looked\r\nat the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a\r\nhalf-laugh, come into his face.\r\n\r\n"I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a\r\nsolitary country towards the river."\r\n\r\n"Most marshes is solitary," said Joe.\r\n\r\n"No doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or\r\nvagrants of any sort, out there?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Joe; "none but a runaway convict now and then. And we don\'t\r\nfind them, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?"\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented;\r\nbut not warmly.\r\n\r\n"Seems you have been out after such?" asked the stranger.\r\n\r\n"Once," returned Joe. "Not that we wanted to take them, you understand;\r\nwe went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip. Didn\'t us, Pip?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Joe."\r\n\r\nThe stranger looked at me again,--still cocking his eye, as if he were\r\nexpressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,--and said, "He\'s a\r\nlikely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?"\r\n\r\n"Pip," said Joe.\r\n\r\n"Christened Pip?"\r\n\r\n"No, not christened Pip."\r\n\r\n"Surname Pip?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Joe, "it\'s a kind of family name what he gave himself when a\r\ninfant, and is called by."\r\n\r\n"Son of yours?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in\r\nanywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at\r\nthe Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was\r\ndiscussed over pipes,--"well--no. No, he ain\'t."\r\n\r\n"Nevvy?" said the strange man.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, "he\r\nis not--no, not to deceive you, he is not--my nevvy."\r\n\r\n"What the Blue Blazes is he?" asked the stranger. Which appeared to me\r\nto be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about relationships,\r\nhaving professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man\r\nmight not marry; and expounded the ties between me and Joe. Having\r\nhis hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling\r\npassage from Richard the Third, and seemed to think he had done quite\r\nenough to account for it when he added, "--as the poet says."\r\n\r\nAnd here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he considered\r\nit a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into\r\nmy eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing who visited\r\nat our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory\r\nprocess under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call to mind that I\r\nwas ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family\r\ncircle, but some large-handed person took some such ophthalmic steps to\r\npatronize me.\r\n\r\nAll this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at\r\nme as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me\r\ndown. But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation,\r\nuntil the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he made his\r\nshot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.\r\n\r\nIt was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was\r\npointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum and water pointedly at me,\r\nand he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me. And he stirred it and\r\nhe tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but with a file.\r\n\r\nHe did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it\r\nhe wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be\r\nJoe\'s file, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the\r\ninstrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound. But he now reclined on his\r\nsettle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally about\r\nturnips.\r\n\r\nThere was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause\r\nbefore going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights, which\r\nstimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on Saturdays\r\nthan at other times. The half-hour and the rum and water running out\r\ntogether, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.\r\n\r\n"Stop half a moment, Mr. Gargery," said the strange man. "I think I\'ve\r\ngot a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, the boy\r\nshall have it."\r\n\r\nHe looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some\r\ncrumpled paper, and gave it to me. "Yours!" said he. "Mind! Your own."\r\n\r\nI thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners,\r\nand holding tight to Joe. He gave Joe good-night, and he gave Mr. Wopsle\r\ngood-night (who went out with us), and he gave me only a look with his\r\naiming eye,--no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders may be done\r\nwith an eye by hiding it.\r\n\r\nOn the way home, if I had been in a humor for talking, the talk must\r\nhave been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of\r\nthe Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wide\r\nopen, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible. But I was in\r\na manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old\r\nacquaintance, and could think of nothing else.\r\n\r\nMy sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in\r\nthe kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell\r\nher about the bright shilling. "A bad un, I\'ll be bound," said Mrs. Joe\r\ntriumphantly, "or he wouldn\'t have given it to the boy! Let\'s look at\r\nit."\r\n\r\nI took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one. "But what\'s\r\nthis?" said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up the\r\npaper. "Two One-Pound notes?"\r\n\r\nNothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to have\r\nbeen on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-markets in\r\nthe county. Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to the Jolly\r\nBargemen to restore them to their owner. While he was gone, I sat down\r\non my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty sure\r\nthat the man would not be there.\r\n\r\nPresently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he,\r\nJoe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.\r\nThen my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them under\r\nsome dried rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in\r\nthe state parlor. There they remained, a nightmare to me, many and many\r\na night and day.\r\n\r\nI had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the\r\nstrange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of the guiltily\r\ncoarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of conspiracy with\r\nconvicts,--a feature in my low career that I had previously forgotten.\r\nI was haunted by the file too. A dread possessed me that when I least\r\nexpected it, the file would reappear. I coaxed myself to sleep by\r\nthinking of Miss Havisham\'s, next Wednesday; and in my sleep I saw\r\nthe file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who held it, and I\r\nscreamed myself awake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham\'s, and my hesitating\r\nring at the gate brought out Estella. She locked it after admitting\r\nme, as she had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passage\r\nwhere her candle stood. She took no notice of me until she had the\r\ncandle in her hand, when she looked over her shoulder, superciliously\r\nsaying, "You are to come this way to-day," and took me to quite another\r\npart of the house.\r\n\r\nThe passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square\r\nbasement of the Manor House. We traversed but one side of the square,\r\nhowever, and at the end of it she stopped, and put her candle down and\r\nopened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in\r\na small paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by a\r\ndetached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to the\r\nmanager or head clerk of the extinct brewery. There was a clock in the\r\nouter wall of this house. Like the clock in Miss Havisham\'s room, and\r\nlike Miss Havisham\'s watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.\r\n\r\nWe went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a\r\nlow ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back. There was some company in\r\nthe room, and Estella said to me as she joined it, "You are to go and\r\nstand there boy, till you are wanted." "There", being the window, I\r\ncrossed to it, and stood "there," in a very uncomfortable state of mind,\r\nlooking out.\r\n\r\nIt opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the\r\nneglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box-tree\r\nthat had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new\r\ngrowth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different color, as if\r\nthat part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt. This\r\nwas my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. There had been\r\nsome light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge;\r\nbut, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden,\r\nand the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window,\r\nas if it pelted me for coming there.\r\n\r\nI divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that\r\nits other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing of the room\r\nexcept the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened in\r\nall my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.\r\n\r\nThere were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I had been\r\nstanding at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me that\r\nthey were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended not\r\nto know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the admission\r\nthat he or she did know it, would have made him or her out to be a toady\r\nand humbug.\r\n\r\nThey all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody\'s pleasure,\r\nand the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to\r\nrepress a yawn. This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded\r\nme of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and (as I found\r\nwhen I caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features. Indeed, when\r\nI knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had any features\r\nat all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of her face.\r\n\r\n"Poor dear soul!" said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite my\r\nsister\'s. "Nobody\'s enemy but his own!"\r\n\r\n"It would be much more commendable to be somebody else\'s enemy," said\r\nthe gentleman; "far more natural."\r\n\r\n"Cousin Raymond," observed another lady, "we are to love our neighbor."\r\n\r\n"Sarah Pocket," returned Cousin Raymond, "if a man is not his own\r\nneighbor, who is?"\r\n\r\nMiss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said (checking a yawn),\r\n"The idea!" But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good\r\nidea too. The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and\r\nemphatically, "Very true!"\r\n\r\n"Poor soul!" Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all been looking\r\nat me in the mean time), "he is so very strange! Would anyone believe\r\nthat when Tom\'s wife died, he actually could not be induced to see the\r\nimportance of the children\'s having the deepest of trimmings to their\r\nmourning? \'Good Lord!\' says he, \'Camilla, what can it signify so long\r\nas the poor bereaved little things are in black?\' So like Matthew! The\r\nidea!"\r\n\r\n"Good points in him, good points in him," said Cousin Raymond; "Heaven\r\nforbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had, and he never\r\nwill have, any sense of the proprieties."\r\n\r\n"You know I was obliged," said Camilla,--"I was obliged to be firm. I\r\nsaid, \'It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.\' I told him that,\r\nwithout deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from\r\nbreakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last he flung out\r\nin his violent way, and said, with a D, \'Then do as you like.\' Thank\r\nGoodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly\r\nwent out in a pouring rain and bought the things."\r\n\r\n"He paid for them, did he not?" asked Estella.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not the question, my dear child, who paid for them," returned\r\nCamilla. "I bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace,\r\nwhen I wake up in the night."\r\n\r\nThe ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or\r\ncall along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the conversation\r\nand caused Estella to say to me, "Now, boy!" On my turning round, they\r\nall looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went out, I heard\r\nSarah Pocket say, "Well I am sure! What next!" and Camilla add, with\r\nindignation, "Was there ever such a fancy! The i-de-a!"\r\n\r\nAs we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Estella stopped\r\nall of a sudden, and, facing round, said in her taunting manner, with\r\nher face quite close to mine,--\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"Well, miss?" I answered, almost falling over her and checking myself.\r\n\r\nShe stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her.\r\n\r\n"Am I pretty?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I think you are very pretty."\r\n\r\n"Am I insulting?"\r\n\r\n"Not so much so as you were last time," said I.\r\n\r\n"Not so much so?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nShe fired when she asked the last question, and she slapped my face with\r\nsuch force as she had, when I answered it.\r\n\r\n"Now?" said she. "You little coarse monster, what do you think of me\r\nnow?"\r\n\r\n"I shall not tell you."\r\n\r\n"Because you are going to tell upstairs. Is that it?"\r\n\r\n"No," said I, "that\'s not it."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you cry again, you little wretch?"\r\n\r\n"Because I\'ll never cry for you again," said I. Which was, I suppose, as\r\nfalse a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying for her\r\nthen, and I know what I know of the pain she cost me afterwards.\r\n\r\nWe went on our way upstairs after this episode; and, as we were going\r\nup, we met a gentleman groping his way down.\r\n\r\n"Whom have we here?" asked the gentleman, stopping and looking at me.\r\n\r\n"A boy," said Estella.\r\n\r\nHe was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with an\r\nexceedingly large head, and a corresponding large hand. He took my chin\r\nin his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the\r\nlight of the candle. He was prematurely bald on the top of his head, and\r\nhad bushy black eyebrows that wouldn\'t lie down but stood up bristling.\r\nHis eyes were set very deep in his head, and were disagreeably sharp and\r\nsuspicious. He had a large watch-chain, and strong black dots where his\r\nbeard and whiskers would have been if he had let them. He was nothing\r\nto me, and I could have had no foresight then, that he ever would be\r\nanything to me, but it happened that I had this opportunity of observing\r\nhim well.\r\n\r\n"Boy of the neighborhood? Hey?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said I.\r\n\r\n"How do you come here?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Havisham sent for me, sir," I explained.\r\n\r\n"Well! Behave yourself. I have a pretty large experience of boys, and\r\nyou\'re a bad set of fellows. Now mind!" said he, biting the side of his\r\ngreat forefinger as he frowned at me, "you behave yourself!"\r\n\r\nWith those words, he released me--which I was glad of, for his hand\r\nsmelt of scented soap--and went his way downstairs. I wondered whether\r\nhe could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he couldn\'t be a doctor, or he\r\nwould have a quieter and more persuasive manner. There was not much time\r\nto consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havisham\'s room, where\r\nshe and everything else were just as I had left them. Estella left me\r\nstanding near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havisham cast her\r\neyes upon me from the dressing-table.\r\n\r\n"So!" she said, without being startled or surprised: "the days have worn\r\naway, have they?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am. To-day is--"\r\n\r\n"There, there, there!" with the impatient movement of her fingers. "I\r\ndon\'t want to know. Are you ready to play?"\r\n\r\nI was obliged to answer in some confusion, "I don\'t think I am, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Not at cards again?" she demanded, with a searching look.\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am; I could do that, if I was wanted."\r\n\r\n"Since this house strikes you old and grave, boy," said Miss Havisham,\r\nimpatiently, "and you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?"\r\n\r\nI could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to\r\nfind for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.\r\n\r\n"Then go into that opposite room," said she, pointing at the door behind\r\nme with her withered hand, "and wait there till I come."\r\n\r\nI crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated.\r\nFrom that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had an\r\nairless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled in\r\nthe damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than\r\nto burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder\r\nthan the clearer air,--like our own marsh mist. Certain wintry branches\r\nof candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the chamber; or it\r\nwould be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its darkness. It was\r\nspacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but every discernible\r\nthing in it was covered with dust and mould, and dropping to pieces. The\r\nmost prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it,\r\nas if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all\r\nstopped together. An epergne or centre-piece of some kind was in the\r\nmiddle of this cloth; it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its\r\nform was quite undistinguishable; and, as I looked along the yellow\r\nexpanse out of which I remember its seeming to grow, like a black\r\nfungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home\r\nto it, and running out from it, as if some circumstances of the greatest\r\npublic importance had just transpired in the spider community.\r\n\r\nI heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same\r\noccurrence were important to their interests. But the black beetles took\r\nno notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a ponderous\r\nelderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of hearing, and not\r\non terms with one another.\r\n\r\nThese crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching\r\nthem from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.\r\nIn her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned, and\r\nshe looked like the Witch of the place.\r\n\r\n"This," said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, "is where I\r\nwill be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here."\r\n\r\nWith some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and\r\nthere and die at once, the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork\r\nat the Fair, I shrank under her touch.\r\n\r\n"What do you think that is?" she asked me, again pointing with her\r\nstick; "that, where those cobwebs are?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t guess what it is, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine!"\r\n\r\nShe looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said,\r\nleaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, "Come, come, come!\r\nWalk me, walk me!"\r\n\r\nI made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss\r\nHavisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and\r\nshe leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have\r\nbeen an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr.\r\nPumblechook\'s chaise-cart.\r\n\r\nShe was not physically strong, and after a little time said, "Slower!"\r\nStill, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she\r\ntwitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me to\r\nbelieve that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast. After a\r\nwhile she said, "Call Estella!" so I went out on the landing and\r\nroared that name as I had done on the previous occasion. When her light\r\nappeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round\r\nand round the room.\r\n\r\nIf only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should\r\nhave felt sufficiently discontented; but as she brought with her the\r\nthree ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn\'t know\r\nwhat to do. In my politeness, I would have stopped; but Miss\r\nHavisham twitched my shoulder, and we posted on,--with a shame-faced\r\nconsciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing.\r\n\r\n"Dear Miss Havisham," said Miss Sarah Pocket. "How well you look!"\r\n\r\n"I do not," returned Miss Havisham. "I am yellow skin and bone."\r\n\r\nCamilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and she\r\nmurmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, "Poor dear\r\nsoul! Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing. The idea!"\r\n\r\n"And how are you?" said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As we were close to\r\nCamilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss\r\nHavisham wouldn\'t stop. We swept on, and I felt that I was highly\r\nobnoxious to Camilla.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Miss Havisham," she returned, "I am as well as can be\r\nexpected."\r\n\r\n"Why, what\'s the matter with you?" asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding\r\nsharpness.\r\n\r\n"Nothing worth mentioning," replied Camilla. "I don\'t wish to make a\r\ndisplay of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in the\r\nnight than I am quite equal to."\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t think of me," retorted Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n"Very easily said!" remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a\r\nhitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed. "Raymond is a\r\nwitness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.\r\nRaymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokings\r\nand nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think with\r\nanxiety of those I love. If I could be less affectionate and sensitive,\r\nI should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure\r\nI wish it could be so. But as to not thinking of you in the night--The\r\nidea!" Here, a burst of tears.\r\n\r\nThe Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and\r\nhim I understood to be Mr. Camilla. He came to the rescue at this point,\r\nand said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, "Camilla, my dear, it\r\nis well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to\r\nthe extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other."\r\n\r\n"I am not aware," observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but\r\nonce, "that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that\r\nperson, my dear."\r\n\r\nMiss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugated\r\nold woman, with a small face that might have been made of walnut-shells,\r\nand a large mouth like a cat\'s without the whiskers, supported this\r\nposition by saying, "No, indeed, my dear. Hem!"\r\n\r\n"Thinking is easy enough," said the grave lady.\r\n\r\n"What is easier, you know?" assented Miss Sarah Pocket.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, yes!" cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to\r\nrise from her legs to her bosom. "It\'s all very true! It\'s a weakness\r\nto be so affectionate, but I can\'t help it. No doubt my health would be\r\nmuch better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn\'t change my disposition\r\nif I could. It\'s the cause of much suffering, but it\'s a consolation to\r\nknow I posses it, when I wake up in the night." Here another burst of\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going\r\nround and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of the\r\nvisitors, now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.\r\n\r\n"There\'s Matthew!" said Camilla. "Never mixing with any natural ties,\r\nnever coming here to see how Miss Havisham is! I have taken to the sofa\r\nwith my staylace cut, and have lain there hours insensible, with my head\r\nover the side, and my hair all down, and my feet I don\'t know where--"\r\n\r\n("Much higher than your head, my love," said Mr. Camilla.)\r\n\r\n"I have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account of\r\nMatthew\'s strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has thanked me."\r\n\r\n"Really I must say I should think not!" interposed the grave lady.\r\n\r\n"You see, my dear," added Miss Sarah Pocket (a blandly vicious\r\npersonage), "the question to put to yourself is, who did you expect to\r\nthank you, my love?"\r\n\r\n"Without expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort," resumed\r\nCamilla, "I have remained in that state, hours and hours, and Raymond\r\nis a witness of the extent to which I have choked, and what the total\r\ninefficacy of ginger has been, and I have been heard at the piano-forte\r\ntuner\'s across the street, where the poor mistaken children have even\r\nsupposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance,--and now to be told--"\r\nHere Camilla put her hand to her throat, and began to be quite chemical\r\nas to the formation of new combinations there.\r\n\r\nWhen this same Matthew was mentioned, Miss Havisham stopped me and\r\nherself, and stood looking at the speaker. This change had a great\r\ninfluence in bringing Camilla\'s chemistry to a sudden end.\r\n\r\n"Matthew will come and see me at last," said Miss Havisham, sternly,\r\n"when I am laid on that table. That will be his place,--there," striking\r\nthe table with her stick, "at my head! And yours will be there! And your\r\nhusband\'s there! And Sarah Pocket\'s there! And Georgiana\'s there! Now\r\nyou all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me.\r\nAnd now go!"\r\n\r\nAt the mention of each name, she had struck the table with her stick in\r\na new place. She now said, "Walk me, walk me!" and we went on again.\r\n\r\n"I suppose there\'s nothing to be done," exclaimed Camilla, "but comply\r\nand depart. It\'s something to have seen the object of one\'s love and\r\nduty for even so short a time. I shall think of it with a melancholy\r\nsatisfaction when I wake up in the night. I wish Matthew could have\r\nthat comfort, but he sets it at defiance. I am determined not to make a\r\ndisplay of my feelings, but it\'s very hard to be told one wants to feast\r\non one\'s relations,--as if one was a Giant,--and to be told to go. The\r\nbare idea!"\r\n\r\nMr. Camilla interposing, as Mrs. Camilla laid her hand upon her heaving\r\nbosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I\r\nsupposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of\r\nview, and kissing her hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth. Sarah\r\nPocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last; but Sarah was\r\ntoo knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artful\r\nslipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence. Sarah\r\nPocket then made her separate effect of departing with, "Bless you, Miss\r\nHavisham dear!" and with a smile of forgiving pity on her walnut-shell\r\ncountenance for the weaknesses of the rest.\r\n\r\nWhile Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still walked\r\nwith her hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly. At last she\r\nstopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it\r\nsome seconds,--\r\n\r\n"This is my birthday, Pip."\r\n\r\nI was going to wish her many happy returns, when she lifted her stick.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suffer it to be spoken of. I don\'t suffer those who were here\r\njust now, or any one to speak of it. They come here on the day, but they\r\ndare not refer to it."\r\n\r\nOf course I made no further effort to refer to it.\r\n\r\n"On this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap of\r\ndecay," stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the\r\ntable, but not touching it, "was brought here. It and I have worn away\r\ntogether. The mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth of\r\nmice have gnawed at me."\r\n\r\nShe held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking\r\nat the table; she in her once white dress, all yellow and withered; the\r\nonce white cloth all yellow and withered; everything around in a state\r\nto crumble under a touch.\r\n\r\n"When the ruin is complete," said she, with a ghastly look, "and when\r\nthey lay me dead, in my bride\'s dress on the bride\'s table,--which shall\r\nbe done, and which will be the finished curse upon him,--so much the\r\nbetter if it is done on this day!"\r\n\r\nShe stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own figure\r\nlying there. I remained quiet. Estella returned, and she too remained\r\nquiet. It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time. In\r\nthe heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that brooded in its\r\nremoter corners, I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and I might\r\npresently begin to decay.\r\n\r\nAt length, not coming out of her distraught state by degrees, but in an\r\ninstant, Miss Havisham said, "Let me see you two play cards; why have\r\nyou not begun?" With that, we returned to her room, and sat down as\r\nbefore; I was beggared, as before; and again, as before, Miss Havisham\r\nwatched us all the time, directed my attention to Estella\'s beauty, and\r\nmade me notice it the more by trying her jewels on Estella\'s breast and\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nEstella, for her part, likewise treated me as before, except that she\r\ndid not condescend to speak. When we had played some half-dozen games,\r\na day was appointed for my return, and I was taken down into the yard\r\nto be fed in the former dog-like manner. There, too, I was again left to\r\nwander about as I liked.\r\n\r\nIt is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which\r\nI had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that last\r\noccasion, open or shut. Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I\r\nsaw one now. As it stood open, and as I knew that Estella had let\r\nthe visitors out,--for she had returned with the keys in her hand,--I\r\nstrolled into the garden, and strolled all over it. It was quite a\r\nwilderness, and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it,\r\nwhich seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of\r\nweak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now and then a weedy\r\noffshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan.\r\n\r\nWhen I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but\r\na fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismal\r\ncorner upon which I had looked out of the window. Never questioning for\r\na moment that the house was now empty, I looked in at another window,\r\nand found myself, to my great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with a\r\npale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair.\r\n\r\nThis pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared beside me.\r\nHe had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him, and I\r\nnow saw that he was inky.\r\n\r\n"Halloa!" said he, "young fellow!"\r\n\r\nHalloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to\r\nbe best answered by itself, I said, "Halloa!" politely omitting young\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\n"Who let you in?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Miss Estella."\r\n\r\n"Who gave you leave to prowl about?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Estella."\r\n\r\n"Come and fight," said the pale young gentleman.\r\n\r\nWhat could I do but follow him? I have often asked myself the question\r\nsince; but what else could I do? His manner was so final, and I was\r\nso astonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been under a\r\nspell.\r\n\r\n"Stop a minute, though," he said, wheeling round before we had gone many\r\npaces. "I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too. There it is!"\r\nIn a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against one\r\nanother, daintily flung one of his legs up behind him, pulled my hair,\r\nslapped his hands again, dipped his head, and butted it into my stomach.\r\n\r\nThe bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was\r\nunquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was\r\nparticularly disagreeable just after bread and meat. I therefore hit out\r\nat him and was going to hit out again, when he said, "Aha! Would you?"\r\nand began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled\r\nwithin my limited experience.\r\n\r\n"Laws of the game!" said he. Here, he skipped from his left leg on to\r\nhis right. "Regular rules!" Here, he skipped from his right leg on to\r\nhis left. "Come to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!" Here,\r\nhe dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I\r\nlooked helplessly at him.\r\n\r\nI was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous; but I felt\r\nmorally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have\r\nhad no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to\r\nconsider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, I\r\nfollowed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by\r\nthe junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On his asking me\r\nif I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he begged my\r\nleave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned with a bottle\r\nof water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. "Available for both," he said,\r\nplacing these against the wall. And then fell to pulling off, not\r\nonly his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in a manner at once\r\nlight-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.\r\n\r\nAlthough he did not look very healthy,--having pimples on his face, and\r\na breaking out at his mouth,--these dreadful preparations quite appalled\r\nme. I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller, and he\r\nhad a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance. For\r\nthe rest, he was a young gentleman in a gray suit (when not denuded\r\nfor battle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in\r\nadvance of the rest of him as to development.\r\n\r\nMy heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every\r\ndemonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he were\r\nminutely choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in my life,\r\nas I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his\r\nback, looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly\r\nfore-shortened.\r\n\r\nBut, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with\r\na great show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest\r\nsurprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again,\r\nlooking up at me out of a black eye.\r\n\r\nHis spirit inspired me with great respect. He seemed to have no\r\nstrength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked down;\r\nbut he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or drinking out\r\nof the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself\r\naccording to form, and then came at me with an air and a show that made\r\nme believe he really was going to do for me at last. He got heavily\r\nbruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I hit him, the harder I\r\nhit him; but he came up again and again and again, until at last he got\r\na bad fall with the back of his head against the wall. Even after that\r\ncrisis in our affairs, he got up and turned round and round confusedly a\r\nfew times, not knowing where I was; but finally went on his knees to his\r\nsponge and threw it up: at the same time panting out, "That means you\r\nhave won."\r\n\r\nHe seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the\r\ncontest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I go\r\nso far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of\r\nsavage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darkly\r\nwiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, "Can I help you?"\r\nand he said "No thankee," and I said "Good afternoon," and he said "Same\r\nto you."\r\n\r\nWhen I got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys.\r\nBut she neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept her\r\nwaiting; and there was a bright flush upon her face, as though something\r\nhad happened to delight her. Instead of going straight to the gate, too,\r\nshe stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.\r\n\r\n"Come here! You may kiss me, if you like."\r\n\r\nI kissed her cheek as she turned it to me. I think I would have gone\r\nthrough a great deal to kiss her cheek. But I felt that the kiss was\r\ngiven to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, and\r\nthat it was worth nothing.\r\n\r\nWhat with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what with\r\nthe fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home the light\r\non the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against\r\na black night-sky, and Joe\'s furnace was flinging a path of fire across\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\nMy mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman. The\r\nmore I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentleman on\r\nhis back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the\r\nmore certain it appeared that something would be done to me. I felt that\r\nthe pale young gentleman\'s blood was on my head, and that the Law would\r\navenge it. Without having any definite idea of the penalties I had\r\nincurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not go stalking\r\nabout the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into\r\nthe studious youth of England, without laying themselves open to severe\r\npunishment. For some days, I even kept close at home, and looked out at\r\nthe kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going\r\non an errand, lest the officers of the County Jail should pounce upon\r\nme. The pale young gentleman\'s nose had stained my trousers, and I tried\r\nto wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night. I had cut\r\nmy knuckles against the pale young gentleman\'s teeth, and I twisted my\r\nimagination into a thousand tangles, as I devised incredible ways of\r\naccounting for that damnatory circumstance when I should be haled before\r\nthe Judges.\r\n\r\nWhen the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of\r\nviolence, my terrors reached their height. Whether myrmidons of Justice,\r\nspecially sent down from London, would be lying in ambush behind the\r\ngate;--whether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personal vengeance for\r\nan outrage done to her house, might rise in those grave-clothes of hers,\r\ndraw a pistol, and shoot me dead:--whether suborned boys--a numerous\r\nband of mercenaries--might be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery,\r\nand cuff me until I was no more;--it was high testimony to my confidence\r\nin the spirit of the pale young gentleman, that I never imagined him\r\naccessory to these retaliations; they always came into my mind as the\r\nacts of injudicious relatives of his, goaded on by the state of his\r\nvisage and an indignant sympathy with the family features.\r\n\r\nHowever, go to Miss Havisham\'s I must, and go I did. And behold! nothing\r\ncame of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any way, and no pale\r\nyoung gentleman was to be discovered on the premises. I found the same\r\ngate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked in at the windows\r\nof the detached house; but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed\r\nshutters within, and all was lifeless. Only in the corner where\r\nthe combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the young\r\ngentleman\'s existence. There were traces of his gore in that spot, and I\r\ncovered them with garden-mould from the eye of man.\r\n\r\nOn the broad landing between Miss Havisham\'s own room and that other\r\nroom in which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair,--a\r\nlight chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind. It had been placed\r\nthere since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular\r\noccupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tired of\r\nwalking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, and across\r\nthe landing, and round the other room. Over and over and over again,\r\nwe would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as long as\r\nthree hours at a stretch. I insensibly fall into a general mention of\r\nthese journeys as numerous, because it was at once settled that I should\r\nreturn every alternate day at noon for these purposes, and because I am\r\nnow going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months.\r\n\r\nAs we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more\r\nto me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was\r\nI going to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I\r\nbelieved; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know\r\neverything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that\r\ndesirable end. But she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer my\r\nbeing ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money,--or anything\r\nbut my daily dinner,--nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nEstella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told\r\nme I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me;\r\nsometimes, she would condescend to me; sometimes, she would be quite\r\nfamiliar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she\r\nhated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we were\r\nalone, "Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?" And when I said yes\r\n(for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when we\r\nplayed at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish of\r\nEstella\'s moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods were\r\nso many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what\r\nto say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness,\r\nmurmuring something in her ear that sounded like "Break their hearts my\r\npride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!"\r\n\r\nThere was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which the\r\nburden was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way of rendering\r\nhomage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in that relation\r\ntowards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon\r\niron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of Old Clem\'s\r\nrespected name. Thus, you were to hammer boys round--Old Clem! With a\r\nthump and a sound--Old Clem! Beat it out, beat it out--Old Clem! With a\r\nclink for the stout--Old Clem! Blow the fire, blow the fire--Old\r\nClem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher--Old Clem! One day soon after the\r\nappearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly saying to me, with the\r\nimpatient movement of her fingers, "There, there, there! Sing!" I was\r\nsurprised into crooning this ditty as I pushed her over the floor. It\r\nhappened so to catch her fancy that she took it up in a low brooding\r\nvoice as if she were singing in her sleep. After that, it became\r\ncustomary with us to have it as we moved about, and Estella would often\r\njoin in; though the whole strain was so subdued, even when there were\r\nthree of us, that it made less noise in the grim old house than the\r\nlightest breath of wind.\r\n\r\nWhat could I become with these surroundings? How could my character fail\r\nto be influenced by them? Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were\r\ndazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light from the\r\nmisty yellow rooms?\r\n\r\nPerhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I had\r\nnot previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which\r\nI had confessed. Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly\r\nfail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger\r\nto be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of him.\r\nBesides, that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella discussed,\r\nwhich had come upon me in the beginning, grew much more potent as time\r\nwent on. I reposed complete confidence in no one but Biddy; but I told\r\npoor Biddy everything. Why it came natural to me to do so, and why Biddy\r\nhad a deep concern in everything I told her, I did not know then, though\r\nI think I know now.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with\r\nalmost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. That ass,\r\nPumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of\r\ndiscussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (to\r\nthis hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if these hands\r\ncould have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they would have done\r\nit. The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind, that\r\nhe could not discuss my prospects without having me before him,--as it\r\nwere, to operate upon,--and he would drag me up from my stool (usually\r\nby the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me before the\r\nfire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying, "Now, Mum,\r\nhere is this boy! Here is this boy which you brought up by hand. Hold up\r\nyour head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which so did do. Now,\r\nMum, with respections to this boy!" And then he would rumple my hair\r\nthe wrong way,--which from my earliest remembrance, as already hinted,\r\nI have in my soul denied the right of any fellow-creature to do,--and\r\nwould hold me before him by the sleeve,--a spectacle of imbecility only\r\nto be equalled by himself.\r\n\r\nThen, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations\r\nabout Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me,\r\nthat I used to want--quite painfully--to burst into spiteful tears, fly\r\nat Pumblechook, and pummel him all over. In these dialogues, my sister\r\nspoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at\r\nevery reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron,\r\nwould sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of\r\nmy fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.\r\n\r\nIn these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he was often talked at,\r\nwhile they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe\'s perceiving that\r\nhe was not favorable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old\r\nenough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on\r\nhis knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my\r\nsister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition\r\non his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker out of his\r\nhands, shake him, and put it away. There was a most irritating end to\r\nevery one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to lead up to\r\nit, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching sight of me as\r\nit were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, "Come! there\'s enough of\r\nyou! You get along to bed; you\'ve given trouble enough for one night, I\r\nhope!" As if I had besought them as a favor to bother my life out.\r\n\r\nWe went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we\r\nshould continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss\r\nHavisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she leaning on my\r\nshoulder; and said with some displeasure,--\r\n\r\n"You are growing tall, Pip!"\r\n\r\nI thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look, that\r\nthis might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no control.\r\n\r\nShe said no more at the time; but she presently stopped and looked at me\r\nagain; and presently again; and after that, looked frowning and moody.\r\nOn the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise was over, and\r\nI had landed her at her dressing-table, she stayed me with a movement of\r\nher impatient fingers:--\r\n\r\n"Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours."\r\n\r\n"Joe Gargery, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Havisham."\r\n\r\n"You had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come here with\r\nyou, and bring your indentures, do you think?"\r\n\r\nI signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honor to be\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"Then let him come."\r\n\r\n"At any particular time, Miss Havisham?"\r\n\r\n"There, there! I know nothing about times. Let him come soon, and come\r\nalong with you."\r\n\r\nWhen I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister\r\n"went on the Rampage," in a more alarming degree than at any previous\r\nperiod. She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was door-mats under\r\nour feet, and how we dared to use her so, and what company we graciously\r\nthought she was fit for? When she had exhausted a torrent of such\r\ninquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loud sobbing,\r\ngot out the dustpan,--which was always a very bad sign,--put on her\r\ncoarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent. Not satisfied\r\nwith a dry cleaning, she took to a pail and scrubbing-brush, and cleaned\r\nus out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in the back-yard.\r\nIt was ten o\'clock at night before we ventured to creep in again, and\r\nthen she asked Joe why he hadn\'t married a Negress Slave at once?\r\nJoe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his whisker and\r\nlooking dejectedly at me, as if he thought it really might have been a\r\nbetter speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\n\r\nIt was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see\r\nJoe arraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss\r\nHavisham\'s. However, as he thought his court-suit necessary to the\r\noccasion, it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in his\r\nworking-dress; the rather, because I knew he made himself so dreadfully\r\nuncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was for me he pulled\r\nup his shirt-collar so very high behind, that it made the hair on the\r\ncrown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast-time my sister declared her intention of going to town with\r\nus, and being left at Uncle Pumblechook\'s and called for "when we had\r\ndone with our fine ladies"--a way of putting the case, from which Joe\r\nappeared inclined to augur the worst. The forge was shut up for the day,\r\nand Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door (as it was his custom to do on\r\nthe very rare occasions when he was not at work) the monosyllable\r\nHOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the\r\ndirection he had taken.\r\n\r\nWe walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large beaver\r\nbonnet, and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaited\r\nStraw, a pair of pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, though it\r\nwas a fine bright day. I am not quite clear whether these articles were\r\ncarried penitentially or ostentatiously; but I rather think they were\r\ndisplayed as articles of property,--much as Cleopatra or any other\r\nsovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to Pumblechook\'s, my sister bounced in and left us. As it\r\nwas almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham\'s house.\r\nEstella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she appeared, Joe took\r\nhis hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands; as if\r\nhe had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a\r\nquarter of an ounce.\r\n\r\nEstella took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I knew\r\nso well. I followed next to her, and Joe came last. When I looked back\r\nat Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with the\r\ngreatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of\r\nhis toes.\r\n\r\nEstella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coat-cuff\r\nand conducted him into Miss Havisham\'s presence. She was seated at her\r\ndressing-table, and looked round at us immediately.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said she to Joe. "You are the husband of the sister of this boy?"\r\n\r\nI could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or\r\nso like some extraordinary bird; standing as he did speechless, with his\r\ntuft of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open as if he wanted a worm.\r\n\r\n"You are the husband," repeated Miss Havisham, "of the sister of this\r\nboy?"\r\n\r\nIt was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview, Joe persisted in\r\naddressing Me instead of Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n"Which I meantersay, Pip," Joe now observed in a manner that was at\r\nonce expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and great\r\npoliteness, "as I hup and married your sister, and I were at the time\r\nwhat you might call (if you was anyways inclined) a single man."\r\n\r\n"Well!" said Miss Havisham. "And you have reared the boy, with the\r\nintention of taking him for your apprentice; is that so, Mr. Gargery?"\r\n\r\n"You know, Pip," replied Joe, "as you and me were ever friends, and it\r\nwere looked for\'ard to betwixt us, as being calc\'lated to lead to\r\nlarks. Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the\r\nbusiness,--such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like,--not\r\nbut what they would have been attended to, don\'t you see?"\r\n\r\n"Has the boy," said Miss Havisham, "ever made any objection? Does he\r\nlike the trade?"\r\n\r\n"Which it is well beknown to yourself, Pip," returned Joe, strengthening\r\nhis former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and politeness, "that\r\nit were the wish of your own hart." (I saw the idea suddenly break upon\r\nhim that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion, before he went on\r\nto say) "And there weren\'t no objection on your part, and Pip it were\r\nthe great wish of your hart!"\r\n\r\nIt was quite in vain for me to endeavor to make him sensible that he\r\nought to speak to Miss Havisham. The more I made faces and gestures\r\nto him to do it, the more confidential, argumentative, and polite, he\r\npersisted in being to Me.\r\n\r\n"Have you brought his indentures with you?" asked Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n"Well, Pip, you know," replied Joe, as if that were a little\r\nunreasonable, "you yourself see me put \'em in my \'at, and therefore you\r\nknow as they are here." With which he took them out, and gave them, not\r\nto Miss Havisham, but to me. I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good\r\nfellow,--I know I was ashamed of him,--when I saw that Estella stood\r\nat the back of Miss Havisham\'s chair, and that her eyes laughed\r\nmischievously. I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to\r\nMiss Havisham.\r\n\r\n"You expected," said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over, "no premium\r\nwith the boy?"\r\n\r\n"Joe!" I remonstrated, for he made no reply at all. "Why don\'t you\r\nanswer--"\r\n\r\n"Pip," returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt, "which I\r\nmeantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself\r\nand me, and which you know the answer to be full well No. You know it to\r\nbe No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?"\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was\r\nbetter than I had thought possible, seeing what he was there; and took\r\nup a little bag from the table beside her.\r\n\r\n"Pip has earned a premium here," she said, "and here it is. There are\r\nfive-and-twenty guineas in this bag. Give it to your master, Pip."\r\n\r\nAs if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in\r\nhim by her strange figure and the strange room, Joe, even at this pass,\r\npersisted in addressing me.\r\n\r\n"This is wery liberal on your part, Pip," said Joe, "and it is as such\r\nreceived and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near,\r\nnor nowheres. And now, old chap," said Joe, conveying to me a sensation,\r\nfirst of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that familiar\r\nexpression were applied to Miss Havisham,--"and now, old chap, may we\r\ndo our duty! May you and me do our duty, both on us, by one and another,\r\nand by them which your liberal present--have-conweyed--to be--for the\r\nsatisfaction of mind-of--them as never--" here Joe showed that he felt\r\nhe had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he triumphantly rescued\r\nhimself with the words, "and from myself far be it!" These words had\r\nsuch a round and convincing sound for him that he said them twice.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Pip!" said Miss Havisham. "Let them out, Estella."\r\n\r\n"Am I to come again, Miss Havisham?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"No. Gargery is your master now. Gargery! One word!"\r\n\r\nThus calling him back as I went out of the door, I heard her say to Joe\r\nin a distinct emphatic voice, "The boy has been a good boy here, and\r\nthat is his reward. Of course, as an honest man, you will expect no\r\nother and no more."\r\n\r\nHow Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but\r\nI know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs\r\ninstead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went\r\nafter him and laid hold of him. In another minute we were outside the\r\ngate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone. When we stood in the\r\ndaylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me,\r\n"Astonishing!" And there he remained so long saying, "Astonishing" at\r\nintervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never coming\r\nback. At length he prolonged his remark into "Pip, I do assure you this\r\nis as-TON-ishing!" and so, by degrees, became conversational and able to\r\nwalk away.\r\n\r\nI have reason to think that Joe\'s intellects were brightened by the\r\nencounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook\'s\r\nhe invented a subtle and deep design. My reason is to be found in\r\nwhat took place in Mr. Pumblechook\'s parlor: where, on our presenting\r\nourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.\r\n\r\n"Well?" cried my sister, addressing us both at once. "And what\'s\r\nhappened to you? I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor\r\nsociety as this, I am sure I do!"\r\n\r\n"Miss Havisham," said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of\r\nremembrance, "made it wery partick\'ler that we should give her--were it\r\ncompliments or respects, Pip?"\r\n\r\n"Compliments," I said.\r\n\r\n"Which that were my own belief," answered Joe; "her compliments to Mrs.\r\nJ. Gargery--"\r\n\r\n"Much good they\'ll do me!" observed my sister; but rather gratified too.\r\n\r\n"And wishing," pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like another\r\neffort of remembrance, "that the state of Miss Havisham\'s elth were\r\nsitch as would have--allowed, were it, Pip?"\r\n\r\n"Of her having the pleasure," I added.\r\n\r\n"Of ladies\' company," said Joe. And drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n"Well!" cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook.\r\n"She might have had the politeness to send that message at first, but\r\nit\'s better late than never. And what did she give young Rantipole\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\n"She giv\' him," said Joe, "nothing."\r\n\r\nMrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.\r\n\r\n"What she giv\'," said Joe, "she giv\' to his friends. \'And by his\r\nfriends,\' were her explanation, \'I mean into the hands of his sister\r\nMrs. J. Gargery.\' Them were her words; \'Mrs. J. Gargery.\' She mayn\'t\r\nhave know\'d," added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, "whether it\r\nwere Joe, or Jorge."\r\n\r\nMy sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his wooden\r\narm-chair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had known all\r\nabout it beforehand.\r\n\r\n"And how much have you got?" asked my sister, laughing. Positively\r\nlaughing!\r\n\r\n"What would present company say to ten pound?" demanded Joe.\r\n\r\n"They\'d say," returned my sister, curtly, "pretty well. Not too much,\r\nbut pretty well."\r\n\r\n"It\'s more than that, then," said Joe.\r\n\r\nThat fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he\r\nrubbed the arms of his chair, "It\'s more than that, Mum."\r\n\r\n"Why, you don\'t mean to say--" began my sister.\r\n\r\n"Yes I do, Mum," said Pumblechook; "but wait a bit. Go on, Joseph. Good\r\nin you! Go on!"\r\n\r\n"What would present company say," proceeded Joe, "to twenty pound?"\r\n\r\n"Handsome would be the word," returned my sister.\r\n\r\n"Well, then," said Joe, "It\'s more than twenty pound."\r\n\r\nThat abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a\r\npatronizing laugh, "It\'s more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow her up,\r\nJoseph!"\r\n\r\n"Then to make an end of it," said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to my\r\nsister; "it\'s five-and-twenty pound."\r\n\r\n"It\'s five-and-twenty pound, Mum," echoed that basest of swindlers,\r\nPumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; "and it\'s no more than your\r\nmerits (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joy of the\r\nmoney!"\r\n\r\nIf the villain had stopped here, his case would have been sufficiently\r\nawful, but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody,\r\nwith a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n"Now you see, Joseph and wife," said Pumblechook, as he took me by the\r\narm above the elbow, "I am one of them that always go right through with\r\nwhat they\'ve begun. This boy must be bound, out of hand. That\'s my way.\r\nBound out of hand."\r\n\r\n"Goodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook," said my sister (grasping the\r\nmoney), "we\'re deeply beholden to you."\r\n\r\n"Never mind me, Mum," returned that diabolical cornchandler. "A\r\npleasure\'s a pleasure all the world over. But this boy, you know; we\r\nmust have him bound. I said I\'d see to it--to tell you the truth."\r\n\r\nThe Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at\r\nonce went over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial\r\npresence. I say we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook,\r\nexactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick; indeed,\r\nit was the general impression in Court that I had been taken red-handed;\r\nfor, as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd, I heard some\r\npeople say, "What\'s he done?" and others, "He\'s a young \'un, too, but\r\nlooks bad, don\'t he?" One person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave\r\nme a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted\r\nup with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, and entitled TO BE READ IN MY\r\nCELL.\r\n\r\nThe Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than a\r\nchurch,--and with people hanging over the pews looking on,--and with\r\nmighty Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning back in chairs, with\r\nfolded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or reading\r\nthe newspapers,--and with some shining black portraits on the walls,\r\nwhich my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and\r\nsticking-plaster. Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed and\r\nattested, and I was "bound"; Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the while\r\nas if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those little\r\npreliminaries disposed of.\r\n\r\nWhen we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had been put\r\ninto great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured,\r\nand who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely\r\nrallying round me, we went back to Pumblechook\'s. And there my sister\r\nbecame so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would serve\r\nher but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue Boar, and\r\nthat Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart, and bring the Hubbles\r\nand Mr. Wopsle.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. For,\r\nit inscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole\r\ncompany, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to make it\r\nworse, they all asked me from time to time,--in short, whenever they\r\nhad nothing else to do,--why I didn\'t enjoy myself? And what could I\r\npossibly do then, but say I was enjoying myself,--when I wasn\'t!\r\n\r\nHowever, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the\r\nmost of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent\r\ncontriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table;\r\nand, when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had\r\nfiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I\r\nplayed at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company,\r\nor indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared\r\nto contemplate as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chair\r\nbeside him to illustrate his remarks.\r\n\r\nMy only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they wouldn\'t\r\nlet me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off, woke me up\r\nand told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in the evening Mr. Wopsle\r\ngave us Collins\'s ode, and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder\r\ndown, with such effect, that a waiter came in and said, "The Commercials\r\nunderneath sent up their compliments, and it wasn\'t the Tumblers\' Arms."\r\nThat, they were all in excellent spirits on the road home, and sang, O\r\nLady Fair! Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and asserting with a tremendously\r\nstrong voice (in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece\r\nof music in a most impertinent manner, by wanting to know all about\r\neverybody\'s private affairs) that he was the man with his white locks\r\nflowing, and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going.\r\n\r\nFinally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly\r\nwretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like\r\nJoe\'s trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\n\r\nIt is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. There may be black\r\ningratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributive and well\r\ndeserved; but that it is a miserable thing, I can testify.\r\n\r\nHome had never been a very pleasant place to me, because of my sister\'s\r\ntemper. But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it. I had\r\nbelieved in the best parlor as a most elegant saloon; I had believed\r\nin the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose\r\nsolemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls; I had\r\nbelieved in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment;\r\nI had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and\r\nindependence. Within a single year all this was changed. Now it was all\r\ncoarse and common, and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella\r\nsee it on any account.\r\n\r\nHow much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault,\r\nhow much Miss Havisham\'s, how much my sister\'s, is now of no moment to\r\nme or to any one. The change was made in me; the thing was done. Well or\r\nill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done.\r\n\r\nOnce, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my\r\nshirt-sleeves and go into the forge, Joe\'s \'prentice, I should be\r\ndistinguished and happy. Now the reality was in my hold, I only felt\r\nthat I was dusty with the dust of small-coal, and that I had a weight\r\nupon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather. There have\r\nbeen occasions in my later life (I suppose as in most lives) when I have\r\nfelt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest\r\nand romance, to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more.\r\nNever has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when my way in\r\nlife lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road\r\nof apprenticeship to Joe.\r\n\r\nI remember that at a later period of my "time," I used to stand about\r\nthe churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling, comparing my\r\nown perspective with the windy marsh view, and making out some likeness\r\nbetween them by thinking how flat and low both were, and how on both\r\nthere came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea. I was quite\r\nas dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that\r\nafter-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe\r\nwhile my indentures lasted. It is about the only thing I am glad to know\r\nof myself in that connection.\r\n\r\nFor, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what I\r\nproceed to add was Joe\'s. It was not because I was faithful, but because\r\nJoe was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldier or\r\na sailor. It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of\r\nindustry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry,\r\nthat I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain. It is not possible\r\nto know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing\r\nman flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it has\r\ntouched one\'s self in going by, and I know right well that any good that\r\nintermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented Joe,\r\nand not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted, who can say? How can I say, when I never knew? What\r\nI dreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest and\r\ncommonest, should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one\r\nof the wooden windows of the forge. I was haunted by the fear that she\r\nwould, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doing\r\nthe coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me.\r\nOften after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we were\r\nsinging Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss\r\nHavisham\'s would seem to show me Estella\'s face in the fire, with her\r\npretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me,--often at\r\nsuch a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the wall\r\nwhich the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her just\r\ndrawing her face away, and would believe that she had come at last.\r\n\r\nAfter that, when we went into supper, the place and the meal would have\r\na more homely look than ever, and I would feel more ashamed of home than\r\never, in my own ungracious breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\n\r\nAs I was getting too big for Mr. Wopsle\'s great-aunt\'s room, my\r\neducation under that preposterous female terminated. Not, however, until\r\nBiddy had imparted to me everything she knew, from the little catalogue\r\nof prices, to a comic song she had once bought for a half-penny.\r\nAlthough the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were\r\nthe opening lines.\r\n\r\n     When I went to Lunnon town sirs,\r\n     Too rul loo rul\r\n     Too rul loo rul\r\n     Wasn\'t I done very brown sirs?\r\n     Too rul loo rul\r\n     Too rul loo rul\r\n\r\n--still, in my desire to be wiser, I got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit, except that I\r\nthought (as I still do) the amount of Too rul somewhat in excess of the\r\npoetry. In my hunger for information, I made proposals to Mr. Wopsle to\r\nbestow some intellectual crumbs upon me, with which he kindly complied.\r\nAs it turned out, however, that he only wanted me for a dramatic\r\nlay-figure, to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied\r\nand clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways, I soon\r\ndeclined that course of instruction; though not until Mr. Wopsle in his\r\npoetic fury had severely mauled me.\r\n\r\nWhatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Joe. This statement sounds so\r\nwell, that I cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained. I wanted\r\nto make Joe less ignorant and common, that he might be worthier of my\r\nsociety and less open to Estella\'s reproach.\r\n\r\nThe old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study, and a broken\r\nslate and a short piece of slate-pencil were our educational implements:\r\nto which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco. I never knew Joe to\r\nremember anything from one Sunday to another, or to acquire, under my\r\ntuition, any piece of information whatever. Yet he would smoke his pipe\r\nat the Battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere else,--even\r\nwith a learned air,--as if he considered himself to be advancing\r\nimmensely. Dear fellow, I hope he did.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant and quiet, out there with the sails on the river passing\r\nbeyond the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was low, looking\r\nas if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the\r\nbottom of the water. Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea\r\nwith their white sails spread, I somehow thought of Miss Havisham and\r\nEstella; and whenever the light struck aslant, afar off, upon a cloud\r\nor sail or green hillside or water-line, it was just the same.--Miss\r\nHavisham and Estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared\r\nto have something to do with everything that was picturesque.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his pipe, had so plumed himself on\r\nbeing "most awful dull," that I had given him up for the day, I lay on\r\nthe earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descrying traces of\r\nMiss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect, in the sky and in the\r\nwater, until at last I resolved to mention a thought concerning them\r\nthat had been much in my head.\r\n\r\n"Joe," said I; "don\'t you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a visit?"\r\n\r\n"Well, Pip," returned Joe, slowly considering. "What for?"\r\n\r\n"What for, Joe? What is any visit made for?"\r\n\r\n"There is some wisits p\'r\'aps," said Joe, "as for ever remains open to\r\nthe question, Pip. But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham. She might\r\nthink you wanted something,--expected something of her."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think I might say that I did not, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"You might, old chap," said Joe. "And she might credit it. Similarly she\r\nmightn\'t."\r\n\r\nJoe felt, as I did, that he had made a point there, and he pulled hard\r\nat his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.\r\n\r\n"You see, Pip," Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger, "Miss\r\nHavisham done the handsome thing by you. When Miss Havisham done the\r\nhandsome thing by you, she called me back to say to me as that were\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Joe. I heard her."\r\n\r\n"ALL," Joe repeated, very emphatically.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Joe. I tell you, I heard her."\r\n\r\n"Which I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her meaning were,--Make a\r\nend on it!--As you was!--Me to the North, and you to the South!--Keep in\r\nsunders!"\r\n\r\nI had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me\r\nto find that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\n"But, Joe."\r\n\r\n"Yes, old chap."\r\n\r\n"Here am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the day\r\nof my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked after\r\nher, or shown that I remember her."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes\r\nall four round,--and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all\r\nfour round might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of\r\nhoofs--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don\'t mean a present."\r\n\r\nBut Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it.\r\n"Or even," said he, "if you was helped to knocking her up a new chain\r\nfor the front door,--or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws for\r\ngeneral use,--or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-fork\r\nwhen she took her muffins,--or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such\r\nlike--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean any present at all, Joe," I interposed.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly\r\npressed it, "if I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn\'t. No, I would not. For\r\nwhat\'s a door-chain when she\'s got one always up? And shark-headers is\r\nopen to misrepresentations. And if it was a toasting-fork, you\'d go into\r\nbrass and do yourself no credit. And the oncommonest workman can\'t show\r\nhimself oncommon in a gridiron,--for a gridiron IS a gridiron," said\r\nJoe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouring to\r\nrouse me from a fixed delusion, "and you may haim at what you like, but\r\na gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again your leave,\r\nand you can\'t help yourself--"\r\n\r\n"My dear Joe," I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat, "don\'t\r\ngo on in that way. I never thought of making Miss Havisham any present."\r\n\r\n"No, Pip," Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, all\r\nalong; "and what I say to you is, you are right, Pip."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack\r\njust now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I would\r\ngo uptown and make a call on Miss Est--Havisham."\r\n\r\n"Which her name," said Joe, gravely, "ain\'t Estavisham, Pip, unless she\r\nhave been rechris\'ened."\r\n\r\n"I know, Joe, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it,\r\nJoe?"\r\n\r\nIn brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well of\r\nit. But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received\r\nwith cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a\r\nvisit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a\r\nfavor received, then this experimental trip should have no successor. By\r\nthese conditions I promised to abide.\r\n\r\nNow, Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick.\r\nHe pretended that his Christian name was Dolge,--a clear\r\nImpossibility,--but he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I\r\nbelieve him to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular, but\r\nwilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its\r\nunderstanding. He was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of\r\ngreat strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching. He never even\r\nseemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by mere\r\naccident; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his dinner, or\r\nwent away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or the Wandering Jew,\r\nas if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever\r\ncoming back. He lodged at a sluice-keeper\'s out on the marshes, and on\r\nworking-days would come slouching from his hermitage, with his hands in\r\nhis pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck\r\nand dangling on his back. On Sundays he mostly lay all day on the\r\nsluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns. He always slouched,\r\nlocomotively, with his eyes on the ground; and, when accosted or\r\notherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a half-resentful,\r\nhalf-puzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had was, that it\r\nwas rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking.\r\n\r\nThis morose journeyman had no liking for me. When I was very small and\r\ntimid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner\r\nof the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well: also that it was\r\nnecessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy, and\r\nthat I might consider myself fuel. When I became Joe\'s \'prentice, Orlick\r\nwas perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace him;\r\nhowbeit, he liked me still less. Not that he ever said anything, or did\r\nanything, openly importing hostility; I only noticed that he always beat\r\nhis sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang Old Clem, he came\r\nin out of time.\r\n\r\nDolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded Joe of\r\nmy half-holiday. He said nothing at the moment, for he and Joe had just\r\ngot a piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the bellows; but by\r\nand by he said, leaning on his hammer,--\r\n\r\n"Now, master! Sure you\'re not a going to favor only one of us. If Young\r\nPip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick." I suppose he was\r\nabout five-and-twenty, but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n"Why, what\'ll you do with a half-holiday, if you get it?" said Joe.\r\n\r\n"What\'ll I do with it! What\'ll he do with it? I\'ll do as much with it as\r\nhim," said Orlick.\r\n\r\n"As to Pip, he\'s going up town," said Joe.\r\n\r\n"Well then, as to Old Orlick, he\'s a going up town," retorted that\r\nworthy. "Two can go up town. Tain\'t only one wot can go up town.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t lose your temper," said Joe.\r\n\r\n"Shall if I like," growled Orlick. "Some and their uptowning! Now,\r\nmaster! Come. No favoring in this shop. Be a man!"\r\n\r\nThe master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in\r\na better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a red-hot\r\nbar, made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body,\r\nwhisked it round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it out,--as\r\nif it were I, I thought, and the sparks were my spirting blood,--and\r\nfinally said, when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold, and he\r\nagain leaned on his hammer,--\r\n\r\n"Now, master!"\r\n\r\n"Are you all right now?" demanded Joe.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I am all right," said gruff Old Orlick.\r\n\r\n"Then, as in general you stick to your work as well as most men," said\r\nJoe, "let it be a half-holiday for all."\r\n\r\nMy sister had been standing silent in the yard, within hearing,--she was\r\na most unscrupulous spy and listener,--and she instantly looked in at\r\none of the windows.\r\n\r\n"Like you, you fool!" said she to Joe, "giving holidays to great idle\r\nhulkers like that. You are a rich man, upon my life, to waste wages in\r\nthat way. I wish I was his master!"\r\n\r\n"You\'d be everybody\'s master, if you durst," retorted Orlick, with an\r\nill-favored grin.\r\n\r\n("Let her alone," said Joe.)\r\n\r\n"I\'d be a match for all noodles and all rogues," returned my sister,\r\nbeginning to work herself into a mighty rage. "And I couldn\'t be a\r\nmatch for the noodles, without being a match for your master, who\'s the\r\ndunder-headed king of the noodles. And I couldn\'t be a match for the\r\nrogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackest-looking and\r\nthe worst rogue between this and France. Now!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re a foul shrew, Mother Gargery," growled the journeyman. "If that\r\nmakes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a good\'un."\r\n\r\n("Let her alone, will you?" said Joe.)\r\n\r\n"What did you say?" cried my sister, beginning to scream. "What did you\r\nsay? What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip? What did he call me,\r\nwith my husband standing by? Oh! oh! oh!" Each of these exclamations was\r\na shriek; and I must remark of my sister, what is equally true of all\r\nthe violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse for\r\nher, because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, she\r\nconsciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself\r\ninto it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; "what was the\r\nname he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me? Oh! Hold me!\r\nOh!"\r\n\r\n"Ah-h-h!" growled the journeyman, between his teeth, "I\'d hold you, if\r\nyou was my wife. I\'d hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you."\r\n\r\n("I tell you, let her alone," said Joe.)\r\n\r\n"Oh! To hear him!" cried my sister, with a clap of her hands and a\r\nscream together,--which was her next stage. "To hear the names he\'s\r\ngiving me! That Orlick! In my own house! Me, a married woman! With my\r\nhusband standing by! Oh! Oh!" Here my sister, after a fit of clappings\r\nand screamings, beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees, and\r\nthrew her cap off, and pulled her hair down,--which were the last stages\r\non her road to frenzy. Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete\r\nsuccess, she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.\r\n\r\nWhat could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parenthetical\r\ninterruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what he meant\r\nby interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whether he was\r\nman enough to come on? Old Orlick felt that the situation admitted of\r\nnothing less than coming on, and was on his defence straightway; so,\r\nwithout so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons, they went\r\nat one another, like two giants. But, if any man in that neighborhood\r\ncould stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man. Orlick, as if he\r\nhad been of no more account than the pale young gentleman, was very\r\nsoon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to come out of it. Then Joe\r\nunlocked the door and picked up my sister, who had dropped insensible\r\nat the window (but who had seen the fight first, I think), and who was\r\ncarried into the house and laid down, and who was recommended to revive,\r\nand would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in Joe\'s hair.\r\nThen, came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars; and\r\nthen, with the vague sensation which I have always connected with such\r\na lull,--namely, that it was Sunday, and somebody was dead,--I went upstairs\r\nto dress myself.\r\n\r\nWhen I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without any\r\nother traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick\'s nostrils,\r\nwhich was neither expressive nor ornamental. A pot of beer had appeared\r\nfrom the Jolly Bargemen, and they were sharing it by turns in a\r\npeaceable manner. The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on\r\nJoe, who followed me out into the road to say, as a parting observation\r\nthat might do me good, "On the Rampage, Pip, and off the Rampage,\r\nPip:--such is Life!"\r\n\r\nWith what absurd emotions (for we think the feelings that are very\r\nserious in a man quite comical in a boy) I found myself again going to\r\nMiss Havisham\'s, matters little here. Nor, how I passed and repassed\r\nthe gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring. Nor, how\r\nI debated whether I should go away without ringing; nor, how I should\r\nundoubtedly have gone, if my time had been my own, to come back.\r\n\r\nMiss Sarah Pocket came to the gate. No Estella.\r\n\r\n"How, then? You here again?" said Miss Pocket. "What do you want?"\r\n\r\nWhen I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was, Sarah\r\nevidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my\r\nbusiness. But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she let me in, and\r\npresently brought the sharp message that I was to "come up."\r\n\r\nEverything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone.\r\n\r\n"Well?" said she, fixing her eyes upon me. "I hope you want nothing?\r\nYou\'ll get nothing."\r\n\r\n"No indeed, Miss Havisham. I only wanted you to know that I am doing\r\nvery well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged to you."\r\n\r\n"There, there!" with the old restless fingers. "Come now and then; come\r\non your birthday.--Ay!" she cried suddenly, turning herself and her\r\nchair towards me, "You are looking round for Estella? Hey?"\r\n\r\nI had been looking round,--in fact, for Estella,--and I stammered that I\r\nhoped she was well.\r\n\r\n"Abroad," said Miss Havisham; "educating for a lady; far out of reach;\r\nprettier than ever; admired by all who see her. Do you feel that you\r\nhave lost her?"\r\n\r\nThere was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last words,\r\nand she broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at a loss what\r\nto say. She spared me the trouble of considering, by dismissing me. When\r\nthe gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the walnut-shell countenance, I\r\nfelt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with\r\neverything; and that was all I took by that motion.\r\n\r\nAs I was loitering along the High Street, looking in disconsolately at\r\nthe shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman,\r\nwho should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle. Mr. Wopsle had in\r\nhis hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he had that\r\nmoment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it on\r\nthe head of Pumblechook, with whom he was going to drink tea. No sooner\r\ndid he see me, than he appeared to consider that a special Providence\r\nhad put a \'prentice in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me,\r\nand insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlor. As I\r\nknew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the\r\nway was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was better\r\nthan none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned into\r\nPumblechook\'s just as the street and the shops were lighting up.\r\n\r\nAs I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, I\r\ndon\'t know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that it\r\ntook until half-past nine o\' clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopsle\r\ngot into Newgate, I thought he never would go to the scaffold, he became\r\nso much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful career. I\r\nthought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short\r\nin his flower after all, as if he had not been running to seed, leaf\r\nafter leaf, ever since his course began. This, however, was a\r\nmere question of length and wearisomeness. What stung me, was the\r\nidentification of the whole affair with my unoffending self. When\r\nBarnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively apologetic,\r\nPumblechook\'s indignant stare so taxed me with it. Wopsle, too, took\r\npains to present me in the worst light. At once ferocious and maudlin, I\r\nwas made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstances whatever;\r\nMillwood put me down in argument, on every occasion; it became sheer\r\nmonomania in my master\'s daughter to care a button for me; and all I can\r\nsay for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning, is,\r\nthat it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character. Even after\r\nI was happily hanged and Wopsle had closed the book, Pumblechook sat\r\nstaring at me, and shaking his head, and saying, "Take warning, boy,\r\ntake warning!" as if it were a well-known fact that I contemplated\r\nmurdering a near relation, provided I could only induce one to have the\r\nweakness to become my benefactor.\r\n\r\nIt was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out with\r\nMr. Wopsle on the walk home. Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out, and\r\nit fell wet and thick. The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out of the\r\nlamp\'s usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substance on\r\nthe fog. We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose with a\r\nchange of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we came upon\r\na man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.\r\n\r\n"Halloa!" we said, stopping. "Orlick there?"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he answered, slouching out. "I was standing by a minute, on the\r\nchance of company."\r\n\r\n"You are late," I remarked.\r\n\r\nOrlick not unnaturally answered, "Well? And you\'re late."\r\n\r\n"We have been," said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his late performance,--"we\r\nhave been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening."\r\n\r\nOld Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we all\r\nwent on together. I asked him presently whether he had been spending his\r\nhalf-holiday up and down town?\r\n\r\n"Yes," said he, "all of it. I come in behind yourself. I didn\'t see you,\r\nbut I must have been pretty close behind you. By the by, the guns is\r\ngoing again."\r\n\r\n"At the Hulks?" said I.\r\n\r\n"Ay! There\'s some of the birds flown from the cages. The guns have been\r\ngoing since dark, about. You\'ll hear one presently."\r\n\r\nIn effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the\r\nwell-remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily\r\nrolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing\r\nand threatening the fugitives.\r\n\r\n"A good night for cutting off in," said Orlick. "We\'d be puzzled how to\r\nbring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night."\r\n\r\nThe subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in\r\nsilence. Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening\'s tragedy,\r\nfell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell. Orlick, with his\r\nhands in his pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was very dark,\r\nvery wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and then, the sound\r\nof the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled sulkily along\r\nthe course of the river. I kept myself to myself and my thoughts. Mr.\r\nWopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly game on Bosworth\r\nField, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury. Orlick sometimes\r\ngrowled, "Beat it out, beat it out,--Old Clem! With a clink for the\r\nstout,--Old Clem!" I thought he had been drinking, but he was not drunk.\r\n\r\nThus, we came to the village. The way by which we approached it took us\r\npast the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to find--it being\r\neleven o\'clock--in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, and\r\nunwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered\r\nabout. Mr. Wopsle dropped into ask what was the matter (surmising that\r\na convict had been taken), but came running out in a great hurry.\r\n\r\n"There\'s something wrong," said he, without stopping, "up at your place,\r\nPip. Run all!"\r\n\r\n"What is it?" I asked, keeping up with him. So did Orlick, at my side.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t quite understand. The house seems to have been violently\r\nentered when Joe Gargery was out. Supposed by convicts. Somebody has\r\nbeen attacked and hurt."\r\n\r\nWe were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made no\r\nstop until we got into our kitchen. It was full of people; the whole\r\nvillage was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and there\r\nwas Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midst\r\nof the kitchen. The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me,\r\nand so I became aware of my sister,--lying without sense or movement on\r\nthe bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow\r\non the back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her face was\r\nturned towards the fire,--destined never to be on the Rampage again,\r\nwhile she was the wife of Joe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\n\r\nWith my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to believe\r\nthat I must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister, or at\r\nall events that as her near relation, popularly known to be under\r\nobligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than\r\nany one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began to\r\nreconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides, I\r\ntook another view of the case, which was more reasonable.\r\n\r\nJoe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from a\r\nquarter after eight o\'clock to a quarter before ten. While he was there,\r\nmy sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had exchanged\r\nGood Night with a farm-laborer going home. The man could not be more\r\nparticular as to the time at which he saw her (he got into dense\r\nconfusion when he tried to be), than that it must have been before nine.\r\nWhen Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he found her struck down\r\non the floor, and promptly called in assistance. The fire had not then\r\nburnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle very long; the\r\ncandle, however, had been blown out.\r\n\r\nNothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond\r\nthe blowing out of the candle,--which stood on a table between the door\r\nand my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was\r\nstruck,--was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such\r\nas she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one\r\nremarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She had been struck with\r\nsomething blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were\r\ndealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable\r\nviolence, as she lay on her face. And on the ground beside her, when Joe\r\npicked her up, was a convict\'s leg-iron which had been filed asunder.\r\n\r\nNow, Joe, examining this iron with a smith\'s eye, declared it to have\r\nbeen filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to the\r\nHulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe\'s opinion\r\nwas corroborated. They did not undertake to say when it had left the\r\nprison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they claimed\r\nto know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by\r\neither of the two convicts who had escaped last night. Further, one of\r\nthose two was already retaken, and had not freed himself of his iron.\r\n\r\nKnowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believed\r\nthe iron to be my convict\'s iron,--the iron I had seen and heard him\r\nfiling at, on the marshes,--but my mind did not accuse him of having put\r\nit to its latest use. For I believed one of two other persons to have\r\nbecome possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.\r\nEither Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file.\r\n\r\nNow, as to Orlick; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we\r\npicked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all the\r\nevening, he had been in divers companies in several public-houses, and\r\nhe had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle. There was nothing against\r\nhim, save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him, and with\r\neverybody else about her, ten thousand times. As to the strange man; if\r\nhe had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no dispute\r\nabout them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore them.\r\nBesides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in so\r\nsilently and suddenly, that she had been felled before she could look\r\nround.\r\n\r\nIt was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however\r\nundesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered unspeakable\r\ntrouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I should at last\r\ndissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the story. For\r\nmonths afterwards, I every day settled the question finally in the\r\nnegative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. The contention\r\ncame, after all, to this;--the secret was such an old one now, had so\r\ngrown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not tear it\r\naway. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much mischief,\r\nit would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me if he\r\nbelieved it, I had a further restraining dread that he would not believe\r\nit, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets as a\r\nmonstrous invention. However, I temporized with myself, of course--for,\r\nwas I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing is always\r\ndone?--and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see any\r\nsuch new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the\r\nassailant.\r\n\r\nThe Constables and the Bow Street men from London--for, this happened in\r\nthe days of the extinct red-waistcoated police--were about the house for\r\na week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like\r\nauthorities doing in other such cases. They took up several obviously\r\nwrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas,\r\nand persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead\r\nof trying to extract ideas from the circumstances. Also, they stood\r\nabout the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks\r\nthat filled the whole neighborhood with admiration; and they had a\r\nmysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as\r\ntaking the culprit. But not quite, for they never did it.\r\n\r\nLong after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay very\r\nill in bed. Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objects multiplied,\r\nand grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the\r\nrealities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and her\r\nspeech was unintelligible. When, at last, she came round so far as to\r\nbe helped downstairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always by\r\nher, that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in\r\nspeech. As she was (very bad handwriting apart) a more than indifferent\r\nspeller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader, extraordinary\r\ncomplications arose between them which I was always called in to solve.\r\nThe administration of mutton instead of medicine, the substitution of\r\nTea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among the mildest of my own\r\nmistakes.\r\n\r\nHowever, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient. A\r\ntremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a\r\npart of her regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three\r\nmonths, she would often put her hands to her head, and would then remain\r\nfor about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind. We were\r\nat a loss to find a suitable attendant for her, until a circumstance\r\nhappened conveniently to relieve us. Mr. Wopsle\'s great-aunt conquered a\r\nconfirmed habit of living into which she had fallen, and Biddy became a\r\npart of our establishment.\r\n\r\nIt may have been about a month after my sister\'s reappearance in the\r\nkitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the\r\nwhole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.\r\nAbove all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly\r\ncut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had\r\nbeen accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to me\r\nevery now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, "Such a fine\r\nfigure of a woman as she once were, Pip!" Biddy instantly taking the\r\ncleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy; Joe\r\nbecame able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life,\r\nand to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that did\r\nhim good. It was characteristic of the police people that they had all\r\nmore or less suspected poor Joe (though he never knew it), and that they\r\nhad to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits\r\nthey had ever encountered.\r\n\r\nBiddy\'s first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty\r\nthat had completely vanquished me. I had tried hard at it, but had made\r\nnothing of it. Thus it was:--\r\n\r\nAgain and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a\r\ncharacter that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost\r\neagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly\r\nwanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,\r\nfrom tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the\r\nsign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my\r\nsister\'s ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a\r\nqualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one after\r\nanother, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the shape\r\nbeing much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and displayed\r\nit to my sister with considerable confidence. But she shook her head to\r\nthat extent when she was shown it, that we were terrified lest in her\r\nweak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck.\r\n\r\nWhen my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this\r\nmysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully\r\nat it, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked\r\nthoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by his\r\ninitial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.\r\n\r\n"Why, of course!" cried Biddy, with an exultant face. "Don\'t you see?\r\nIt\'s him!"\r\n\r\nOrlick, without a doubt! She had lost his name, and could only signify\r\nhim by his hammer. We told him why we wanted him to come into the\r\nkitchen, and he slowly laid down his hammer, wiped his brow with his\r\narm, took another wipe at it with his apron, and came slouching\r\nout, with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly\r\ndistinguished him.\r\n\r\nI confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him, and that I\r\nwas disappointed by the different result. She manifested the greatest\r\nanxiety to be on good terms with him, was evidently much pleased by his\r\nbeing at length produced, and motioned that she would have him\r\ngiven something to drink. She watched his countenance as if she were\r\nparticularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception,\r\nshe showed every possible desire to conciliate him, and there was an air\r\nof humble propitiation in all she did, such as I have seen pervade the\r\nbearing of a child towards a hard master. After that day, a day rarely\r\npassed without her drawing the hammer on her slate, and without Orlick\'s\r\nslouching in and standing doggedly before her, as if he knew no more\r\nthan I did what to make of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII\r\n\r\nI now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which was\r\nvaried beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no more\r\nremarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying\r\nanother visit to Miss Havisham. I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty\r\nat the gate; I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her, and she spoke\r\nof Estella in the very same way, if not in the very same words. The\r\ninterview lasted but a few minutes, and she gave me a guinea when I was\r\ngoing, and told me to come again on my next birthday. I may mention at\r\nonce that this became an annual custom. I tried to decline taking the\r\nguinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than causing her\r\nto ask me very angrily, if I expected more? Then, and after that, I took\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSo unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkened\r\nroom, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass, that\r\nI felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that\r\nmysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it grew\r\nolder, it stood still. Daylight never entered the house as to my\r\nthoughts and remembrances of it, any more than as to the actual fact. It\r\nbewildered me, and under its influence I continued at heart to hate my\r\ntrade and to be ashamed of home.\r\n\r\nImperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however. Her\r\nshoes came up at the heel, her hair grew bright and neat, her hands were\r\nalways clean. She was not beautiful,--she was common, and could not be\r\nlike Estella,--but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered.\r\nShe had not been with us more than a year (I remember her being newly\r\nout of mourning at the time it struck me), when I observed to myself one\r\nevening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes; eyes that\r\nwere very pretty and very good.\r\n\r\nIt came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring\r\nat--writing some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at\r\nonce by a sort of stratagem--and seeing Biddy observant of what I was\r\nabout. I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework without\r\nlaying it down.\r\n\r\n"Biddy," said I, "how do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or you\r\nare very clever."\r\n\r\n"What is it that I manage? I don\'t know," returned Biddy, smiling.\r\n\r\nShe managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not\r\nmean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.\r\n\r\n"How do you manage, Biddy," said I, "to learn everything that I learn,\r\nand always to keep up with me?" I was beginning to be rather vain of\r\nmy knowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the\r\ngreater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have no\r\ndoubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.\r\n\r\n"I might as well ask you," said Biddy, "how you manage?"\r\n\r\n"No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see\r\nme turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I must catch it like a cough," said Biddy, quietly; and went\r\non with her sewing.\r\n\r\nPursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at\r\nBiddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her rather\r\nan extraordinary girl. For I called to mind now, that she was equally\r\naccomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our different\r\nsorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I knew, Biddy\r\nknew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith as I, or\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n"You are one of those, Biddy," said I, "who make the most of every\r\nchance. You never had a chance before you came here, and see how\r\nimproved you are!"\r\n\r\nBiddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing. "I was\r\nyour first teacher though; wasn\'t I?" said she, as she sewed.\r\n\r\n"Biddy!" I exclaimed, in amazement. "Why, you are crying!"\r\n\r\n"No I am not," said Biddy, looking up and laughing. "What put that in\r\nyour head?"\r\n\r\nWhat could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it\r\ndropped on her work? I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had been\r\nuntil Mr. Wopsle\'s great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of\r\nliving, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalled\r\nthe hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the\r\nmiserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school,\r\nwith that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and\r\nshouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there must\r\nhave been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first\r\nuneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of\r\ncourse. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I\r\nlooked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps\r\nI had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been too\r\nreserved, and should have patronized her more (though I did not use that\r\nprecise word in my meditations) with my confidence.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Biddy," I observed, when I had done turning it over, "you were my\r\nfirst teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being\r\ntogether like this, in this kitchen."\r\n\r\n"Ah, poor thing!" replied Biddy. It was like her self-forgetfulness to\r\ntransfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her,\r\nmaking her more comfortable; "that\'s sadly true!"\r\n\r\n"Well!" said I, "we must talk together a little more, as we used to do.\r\nAnd I must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let us have a\r\nquiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat."\r\n\r\nMy sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertook\r\nthe care of her on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went out\r\ntogether. It was summer-time, and lovely weather. When we had passed the\r\nvillage and the church and the churchyard, and were out on the marshes\r\nand began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, I began to\r\ncombine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in my usual way.\r\nWhen we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank, with the water\r\nrippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than it would have been\r\nwithout that sound, I resolved that it was a good time and place for the\r\nadmission of Biddy into my inner confidence.\r\n\r\n"Biddy," said I, after binding her to secrecy, "I want to be a\r\ngentleman."\r\n\r\n"O, I wouldn\'t, if I was you!" she returned. "I don\'t think it would\r\nanswer."\r\n\r\n"Biddy," said I, with some severity, "I have particular reasons for\r\nwanting to be a gentleman."\r\n\r\n"You know best, Pip; but don\'t you think you are happier as you are?"\r\n\r\n"Biddy," I exclaimed, impatiently, "I am not at all happy as I am. I\r\nam disgusted with my calling and with my life. I have never taken to\r\neither, since I was bound. Don\'t be absurd."\r\n\r\n"Was I absurd?" said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows; "I am sorry\r\nfor that; I didn\'t mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to be\r\ncomfortable."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be\r\ncomfortable--or anything but miserable--there, Biddy!--unless I can lead\r\na very different sort of life from the life I lead now."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a pity!" said Biddy, shaking her head with a sorrowful air.\r\n\r\nNow, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kind of\r\nquarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half inclined\r\nto shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave utterance to her\r\nsentiment and my own. I told her she was right, and I knew it was much\r\nto be regretted, but still it was not to be helped.\r\n\r\n"If I could have settled down," I said to Biddy, plucking up the short\r\ngrass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings\r\nout of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,--"if I could have\r\nsettled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was\r\nlittle, I know it would have been much better for me. You and I and Joe\r\nwould have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I would perhaps have gone\r\npartners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up to\r\nkeep company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine\r\nSunday, quite different people. I should have been good enough for you;\r\nshouldn\'t I, Biddy?"\r\n\r\nBiddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on, and returned for\r\nanswer, "Yes; I am not over-particular." It scarcely sounded flattering,\r\nbut I knew she meant well.\r\n\r\n"Instead of that," said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or\r\ntwo, "see how I am going on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable, and--what\r\nwould it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody had told me\r\nso!"\r\n\r\nBiddy turned her face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more\r\nattentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships.\r\n\r\n"It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say," she\r\nremarked, directing her eyes to the ships again. "Who said it?"\r\n\r\nI was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where\r\nI was going to. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I\r\nanswered, "The beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham\'s, and she\'s more\r\nbeautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully, and I want\r\nto be a gentleman on her account." Having made this lunatic confession,\r\nI began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if I had some\r\nthoughts of following it.\r\n\r\n"Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?" Biddy\r\nquietly asked me, after a pause.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," I moodily answered.\r\n\r\n"Because, if it is to spite her," Biddy pursued, "I should think--but\r\nyou know best--that might be better and more independently done by\r\ncaring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should\r\nthink--but you know best--she was not worth gaining over."\r\n\r\nExactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was\r\nperfectly manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor dazed\r\nvillage lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and\r\nwisest of men fall every day?\r\n\r\n"It may be all quite true," said I to Biddy, "but I admire her\r\ndreadfully."\r\n\r\nIn short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good\r\ngrasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well. All the\r\nwhile knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced,\r\nthat I was quite conscious it would have served my face right, if I\r\nhad lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the pebbles as a\r\npunishment for belonging to such an idiot.\r\n\r\nBiddy was the wisest of girls, and she tried to reason no more with me.\r\nShe put her hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work,\r\nupon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of my hair.\r\nThen she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while with my face\r\nupon my sleeve I cried a little,--exactly as I had done in the brewery\r\nyard,--and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill-used by\r\nsomebody, or by everybody; I can\'t say which.\r\n\r\n"I am glad of one thing," said Biddy, "and that is, that you have felt\r\nyou could give me your confidence, Pip. And I am glad of another thing,\r\nand that is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it\r\nand always so far deserving it. If your first teacher (dear! such a poor\r\none, and so much in need of being taught herself!) had been your teacher\r\nat the present time, she thinks she knows what lesson she would set. But\r\nit would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her, and it\'s\r\nof no use now." So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose from the bank,\r\nand said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, "Shall we walk a\r\nlittle farther, or go home?"\r\n\r\n"Biddy," I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and giving\r\nher a kiss, "I shall always tell you everything."\r\n\r\n"Till you\'re a gentleman," said Biddy.\r\n\r\n"You know I never shall be, so that\'s always. Not that I have any\r\noccasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,--as I\r\ntold you at home the other night."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the ships.\r\nAnd then repeated, with her former pleasant change, "shall we walk a\r\nlittle farther, or go home?"\r\n\r\nI said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and the\r\nsummer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very\r\nbeautiful. I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and\r\nwholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing\r\nbeggar my neighbor by candle-light in the room with the stopped clocks,\r\nand being despised by Estella. I thought it would be very good for me if\r\nI could get her out of my head, with all the rest of those remembrances\r\nand fancies, and could go to work determined to relish what I had to do,\r\nand stick to it, and make the best of it. I asked myself the question\r\nwhether I did not surely know that if Estella were beside me at that\r\nmoment instead of Biddy, she would make me miserable? I was obliged to\r\nadmit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said to myself, "Pip,\r\nwhat a fool you are!"\r\n\r\nWe talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed\r\nright. Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and\r\nsomebody else to-morrow; she would have derived only pain, and no\r\npleasure, from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded her own\r\nbreast than mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like her much\r\nthe better of the two?\r\n\r\n"Biddy," said I, when we were walking homeward, "I wish you could put me\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could!" said Biddy.\r\n\r\n"If I could only get myself to fall in love with you,--you don\'t mind my\r\nspeaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, not at all!" said Biddy. "Don\'t mind me."\r\n\r\n"If I could only get myself to do it, that would be the thing for me."\r\n\r\n"But you never will, you see," said Biddy.\r\n\r\nIt did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as it would have\r\ndone if we had discussed it a few hours before. I therefore observed\r\nI was not quite sure of that. But Biddy said she was, and she said it\r\ndecisively. In my heart I believed her to be right; and yet I took it\r\nrather ill, too, that she should be so positive on the point.\r\n\r\nWhen we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and\r\nget over a stile near a sluice-gate. There started up, from the gate, or\r\nfrom the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his stagnant way),\r\nOld Orlick.\r\n\r\n"Halloa!" he growled, "where are you two going?"\r\n\r\n"Where should we be going, but home?"\r\n\r\n"Well, then," said he, "I\'m jiggered if I don\'t see you home!"\r\n\r\nThis penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of\r\nhis. He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of, but\r\nused it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind, and\r\nconvey an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger, I\r\nhad had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, he would\r\nhave done it with a sharp and twisted hook.\r\n\r\nBiddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper,\r\n"Don\'t let him come; I don\'t like him." As I did not like him either,\r\nI took the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didn\'t want\r\nseeing home. He received that piece of information with a yell of\r\nlaughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nCurious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in\r\nthat murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any\r\naccount, I asked her why she did not like him.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us,\r\n"because I--I am afraid he likes me."\r\n\r\n"Did he ever tell you he liked you?" I asked indignantly.\r\n\r\n"No," said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, "he never told me\r\nso; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye."\r\n\r\nHowever novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not\r\ndoubt the accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed upon\r\nOld Orlick\'s daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage on\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n"But it makes no difference to you, you know," said Biddy, calmly.\r\n\r\n"No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don\'t like it; I don\'t\r\napprove of it."\r\n\r\n"Nor I neither," said Biddy. "Though that makes no difference to you."\r\n\r\n"Exactly," said I; "but I must tell you I should have no opinion of you,\r\nBiddy, if he danced at you with your own consent."\r\n\r\nI kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances\r\nwere favorable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure that\r\ndemonstration. He had struck root in Joe\'s establishment, by reason\r\nof my sister\'s sudden fancy for him, or I should have tried to get him\r\ndismissed. He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as I\r\nhad reason to know thereafter.\r\n\r\nAnd now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated\r\nits confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when I\r\nwas clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that the\r\nplain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to\r\nbe ashamed of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect\r\nand happiness. At those times, I would decide conclusively that my\r\ndisaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that I was\r\ngrowing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company\r\nwith Biddy,--when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the\r\nHavisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and scatter\r\nmy wits again. Scattered wits take a long time picking up; and often\r\nbefore I had got them well together, they would be dispersed in all\r\ndirections by one stray thought, that perhaps after all Miss Havisham\r\nwas going to make my fortune when my time was out.\r\n\r\nIf my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of my\r\nperplexities, I dare say. It never did run out, however, but was brought\r\nto a premature end, as I proceed to relate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\n\r\nIt was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe, and it was a\r\nSaturday night. There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three\r\nJolly Bargemen, attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud.\r\nOf that group I was one.\r\n\r\nA highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr. Wopsle was imbrued\r\nin blood to the eyebrows. He gloated over every abhorrent adjective\r\nin the description, and identified himself with every witness at the\r\nInquest. He faintly moaned, "I am done for," as the victim, and he\r\nbarbarously bellowed, "I\'ll serve you out," as the murderer. He gave the\r\nmedical testimony, in pointed imitation of our local practitioner; and\r\nhe piped and shook, as the aged turnpike-keeper who had heard blows, to\r\nan extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental\r\ncompetency of that witness. The coroner, in Mr. Wopsle\'s hands, became\r\nTimon of Athens; the beadle, Coriolanus. He enjoyed himself thoroughly,\r\nand we all enjoyed ourselves, and were delightfully comfortable. In this\r\ncosey state of mind we came to the verdict Wilful Murder.\r\n\r\nThen, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over\r\nthe back of the settle opposite me, looking on. There was an expression\r\nof contempt on his face, and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he\r\nwatched the group of faces.\r\n\r\n"Well!" said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done, "you\r\nhave settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?"\r\n\r\nEverybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer. He looked\r\nat everybody coldly and sarcastically.\r\n\r\n"Guilty, of course?" said he. "Out with it. Come!"\r\n\r\n"Sir," returned Mr. Wopsle, "without having the honor of your\r\nacquaintance, I do say Guilty." Upon this we all took courage to unite\r\nin a confirmatory murmur.\r\n\r\n"I know you do," said the stranger; "I knew you would. I told you so.\r\nBut now I\'ll ask you a question. Do you know, or do you not know,\r\nthat the law of England supposes every man to be innocent, until he is\r\nproved--proved--to be guilty?"\r\n\r\n"Sir," Mr. Wopsle began to reply, "as an Englishman myself, I--"\r\n\r\n"Come!" said the stranger, biting his forefinger at him. "Don\'t evade\r\nthe question. Either you know it, or you don\'t know it. Which is it to\r\nbe?"\r\n\r\nHe stood with his head on one side and himself on one side, in a\r\nbullying, interrogative manner, and he threw his forefinger at Mr.\r\nWopsle,--as it were to mark him out--before biting it again.\r\n\r\n"Now!" said he. "Do you know it, or don\'t you know it?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I know it," replied Mr. Wopsle.\r\n\r\n"Certainly you know it. Then why didn\'t you say so at first? Now, I\'ll\r\nask you another question,"--taking possession of Mr. Wopsle, as if he\r\nhad a right to him,--"do you know that none of these witnesses have yet\r\nbeen cross-examined?"\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle was beginning, "I can only say--" when the stranger stopped\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"What? You won\'t answer the question, yes or no? Now, I\'ll try you\r\nagain." Throwing his finger at him again. "Attend to me. Are you\r\naware, or are you not aware, that none of these witnesses have yet been\r\ncross-examined? Come, I only want one word from you. Yes, or no?"\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion\r\nof him.\r\n\r\n"Come!" said the stranger, "I\'ll help you. You don\'t deserve help, but\r\nI\'ll help you. Look at that paper you hold in your hand. What is it?"\r\n\r\n"What is it?" repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.\r\n\r\n"Is it," pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious\r\nmanner, "the printed paper you have just been reading from?"\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly."\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly. Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it distinctly\r\nstates that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers\r\ninstructed him altogether to reserve his defence?"\r\n\r\n"I read that just now," Mr. Wopsle pleaded.\r\n\r\n"Never mind what you read just now, sir; I don\'t ask you what you read\r\njust now. You may read the Lord\'s Prayer backwards, if you like,--and,\r\nperhaps, have done it before to-day. Turn to the paper. No, no, no my\r\nfriend; not to the top of the column; you know better than that; to\r\nthe bottom, to the bottom." (We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full of\r\nsubterfuge.) "Well? Have you found it?"\r\n\r\n"Here it is," said Mr. Wopsle.\r\n\r\n"Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it\r\ndistinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was\r\ninstructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence? Come! Do\r\nyou make that of it?"\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle answered, "Those are not the exact words."\r\n\r\n"Not the exact words!" repeated the gentleman bitterly. "Is that the\r\nexact substance?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mr. Wopsle.\r\n\r\n"Yes," repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company\r\nwith his right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle. "And now I ask\r\nyou what you say to the conscience of that man who, with that passage\r\nbefore his eyes, can lay his head upon his pillow after having\r\npronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?"\r\n\r\nWe all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought\r\nhim, and that he was beginning to be found out.\r\n\r\n"And that same man, remember," pursued the gentleman, throwing his\r\nfinger at Mr. Wopsle heavily,--"that same man might be summoned as a\r\njuryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed himself,\r\nmight return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his\r\npillow, after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the\r\nissue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the prisoner at the\r\nbar, and would a true verdict give according to the evidence, so help\r\nhim God!"\r\n\r\nWe were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too\r\nfar, and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and\r\nwith a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of\r\nus that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose\r\nit, left the back of the settle, and came into the space between the two\r\nsettles, in front of the fire, where he remained standing, his left hand\r\nin his pocket, and he biting the forefinger of his right.\r\n\r\n"From information I have received," said he, looking round at us as we\r\nall quailed before him, "I have reason to believe there is a blacksmith\r\namong you, by name Joseph--or Joe--Gargery. Which is the man?"\r\n\r\n"Here is the man," said Joe.\r\n\r\nThe strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place, and Joe went.\r\n\r\n"You have an apprentice," pursued the stranger, "commonly known as Pip?\r\nIs he here?"\r\n\r\n"I am here!" I cried.\r\n\r\nThe stranger did not recognize me, but I recognized him as the gentleman\r\nI had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visit to Miss\r\nHavisham. I had known him the moment I saw him looking over the settle,\r\nand now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder,\r\nI checked off again in detail his large head, his dark complexion, his\r\ndeep-set eyes, his bushy black eyebrows, his large watch-chain, his\r\nstrong black dots of beard and whisker, and even the smell of scented\r\nsoap on his great hand.\r\n\r\n"I wish to have a private conference with you two," said he, when he had\r\nsurveyed me at his leisure. "It will take a little time. Perhaps we\r\nhad better go to your place of residence. I prefer not to anticipate my\r\ncommunication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as you\r\nplease to your friends afterwards; I have nothing to do with that."\r\n\r\nAmidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen,\r\nand in a wondering silence walked home. While going along, the strange\r\ngentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of\r\nhis finger. As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as\r\nan impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front door.\r\nOur conference was held in the state parlor, which was feebly lighted by\r\none candle.\r\n\r\nIt began with the strange gentleman\'s sitting down at the table, drawing\r\nthe candle to him, and looking over some entries in his pocket-book.\r\nHe then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little aside, after\r\npeering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to ascertain which was\r\nwhich.\r\n\r\n"My name," he said, "is Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London. I am\r\npretty well known. I have unusual business to transact with you, and I\r\ncommence by explaining that it is not of my originating. If my advice\r\nhad been asked, I should not have been here. It was not asked, and you\r\nsee me here. What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, I\r\ndo. No less, no more."\r\n\r\nFinding that he could not see us very well from where he sat, he got\r\nup, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thus\r\nhaving one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.\r\n\r\n"Now, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of\r\nthis young fellow your apprentice. You would not object to cancel his\r\nindentures at his request and for his good? You would want nothing for\r\nso doing?"\r\n\r\n"Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip\'s way,"\r\nsaid Joe, staring.\r\n\r\n"Lord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose," returned Mr.\r\nJaggers. "The question is, Would you want anything? Do you want\r\nanything?"\r\n\r\n"The answer is," returned Joe, sternly, "No."\r\n\r\nI thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a fool for\r\nhis disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between breathless\r\ncuriosity and surprise, to be sure of it.\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Mr. Jaggers. "Recollect the admission you have made,\r\nand don\'t try to go from it presently."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s a going to try?" retorted Joe.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do keep a dog."\r\n\r\n"Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.\r\nBear that in mind, will you?" repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his eyes\r\nand nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him something.\r\n"Now, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got to\r\nmake is, that he has great expectations."\r\n\r\nJoe and I gasped, and looked at one another.\r\n\r\n"I am instructed to communicate to him," said Mr. Jaggers, throwing\r\nhis finger at me sideways, "that he will come into a handsome property.\r\nFurther, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that\r\nproperty, that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of life\r\nand from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman,--in a word, as a\r\nyoung fellow of great expectations."\r\n\r\nMy dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; Miss\r\nHavisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale.\r\n\r\n"Now, Mr. Pip," pursued the lawyer, "I address the rest of what I have\r\nto say, to you. You are to understand, first, that it is the request\r\nof the person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear\r\nthe name of Pip. You will have no objection, I dare say, to your great\r\nexpectations being encumbered with that easy condition. But if you have\r\nany objection, this is the time to mention it."\r\n\r\nMy heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears,\r\nthat I could scarcely stammer I had no objection.\r\n\r\n"I should think not! Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, that\r\nthe name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound\r\nsecret, until the person chooses to reveal it. I am empowered to mention\r\nthat it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by\r\nword of mouth to yourself. When or where that intention may be carried\r\nout, I cannot say; no one can say. It may be years hence. Now, you are\r\ndistinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from\r\nmaking any inquiry on this head, or any allusion or reference, however\r\ndistant, to any individual whomsoever as the individual, in all the\r\ncommunications you may have with me. If you have a suspicion in your own\r\nbreast, keep that suspicion in your own breast. It is not the least to\r\nthe purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are; they may be the\r\nstrongest and gravest reasons, or they may be mere whim. This is not for\r\nyou to inquire into. The condition is laid down. Your acceptance of it,\r\nand your observance of it as binding, is the only remaining condition\r\nthat I am charged with, by the person from whom I take my instructions,\r\nand for whom I am not otherwise responsible. That person is the person\r\nfrom whom you derive your expectations, and the secret is solely held by\r\nthat person and by me. Again, not a very difficult condition with which\r\nto encumber such a rise in fortune; but if you have any objection to it,\r\nthis is the time to mention it. Speak out."\r\n\r\nOnce more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection.\r\n\r\n"I should think not! Now, Mr. Pip, I have done with stipulations."\r\nThough he called me Mr. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, he still\r\ncould not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; and even now\r\nhe occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he\r\nspoke, as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my\r\ndisparagement, if he only chose to mention them. "We come next, to mere\r\ndetails of arrangement. You must know that, although I have used\r\nthe term \'expectations\' more than once, you are not endowed with\r\nexpectations only. There is already lodged in my hands a sum of money\r\namply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance. You will\r\nplease consider me your guardian. Oh!" for I was going to thank him, "I\r\ntell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldn\'t render them.\r\nIt is considered that you must be better educated, in accordance with\r\nyour altered position, and that you will be alive to the importance and\r\nnecessity of at once entering on that advantage."\r\n\r\nI said I had always longed for it.\r\n\r\n"Never mind what you have always longed for, Mr. Pip," he retorted;\r\n"keep to the record. If you long for it now, that\'s enough. Am I\r\nanswered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper\r\ntutor? Is that it?"\r\n\r\nI stammered yes, that was it.\r\n\r\n"Good. Now, your inclinations are to be consulted. I don\'t think that\r\nwise, mind, but it\'s my trust. Have you ever heard of any tutor whom you\r\nwould prefer to another?"\r\n\r\nI had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle\'s great-aunt;\r\nso, I replied in the negative.\r\n\r\n"There is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I think\r\nmight suit the purpose," said Mr. Jaggers. "I don\'t recommend him,\r\nobserve; because I never recommend anybody. The gentleman I speak of is\r\none Mr. Matthew Pocket."\r\n\r\nAh! I caught at the name directly. Miss Havisham\'s relation. The Matthew\r\nwhom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of. The Matthew whose place was to\r\nbe at Miss Havisham\'s head, when she lay dead, in her bride\'s dress on\r\nthe bride\'s table.\r\n\r\n"You know the name?" said Mr. Jaggers, looking shrewdly at me, and then\r\nshutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer.\r\n\r\nMy answer was, that I had heard of the name.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said he. "You have heard of the name. But the question is, what do\r\nyou say of it?"\r\n\r\nI said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to him for his\r\nrecommendation--\r\n\r\n"No, my young friend!" he interrupted, shaking his great head very\r\nslowly. "Recollect yourself!"\r\n\r\nNot recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to him\r\nfor his recommendation--\r\n\r\n"No, my young friend," he interrupted, shaking his head and frowning and\r\nsmiling both at once,--"no, no, no; it\'s very well done, but it won\'t\r\ndo; you are too young to fix me with it. Recommendation is not the word,\r\nMr. Pip. Try another."\r\n\r\nCorrecting myself, I said that I was much obliged to him for his mention\r\nof Mr. Matthew Pocket--\r\n\r\n"That\'s more like it!" cried Mr. Jaggers.--And (I added), I would\r\ngladly try that gentleman.\r\n\r\n"Good. You had better try him in his own house. The way shall be\r\nprepared for you, and you can see his son first, who is in London. When\r\nwill you come to London?"\r\n\r\nI said (glancing at Joe, who stood looking on, motionless), that I\r\nsupposed I could come directly.\r\n\r\n"First," said Mr. Jaggers, "you should have some new clothes to come in,\r\nand they should not be working-clothes. Say this day week. You\'ll want\r\nsome money. Shall I leave you twenty guineas?"\r\n\r\nHe produced a long purse, with the greatest coolness, and counted them\r\nout on the table and pushed them over to me. This was the first time he\r\nhad taken his leg from the chair. He sat astride of the chair when he\r\nhad pushed the money over, and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe.\r\n\r\n"Well, Joseph Gargery? You look dumbfoundered?"\r\n\r\n"I am!" said Joe, in a very decided manner.\r\n\r\n"It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?"\r\n\r\n"It were understood," said Joe. "And it are understood. And it ever will\r\nbe similar according."\r\n\r\n"But what," said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his purse,--"what if it was in my\r\ninstructions to make you a present, as compensation?"\r\n\r\n"As compensation what for?" Joe demanded.\r\n\r\n"For the loss of his services."\r\n\r\nJoe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman. I have\r\noften thought him since, like the steam-hammer that can crush a man or\r\npat an egg-shell, in his combination of strength with gentleness. "Pip\r\nis that hearty welcome," said Joe, "to go free with his services, to\r\nhonor and fortun\', as no words can tell him. But if you think as Money\r\ncan make compensation to me for the loss of the little child--what come\r\nto the forge--and ever the best of friends!--"\r\n\r\nO dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, I\r\nsee you again, with your muscular blacksmith\'s arm before your eyes,\r\nand your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away. O dear good\r\nfaithful tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm,\r\nas solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel\'s wing!\r\n\r\nBut I encouraged Joe at the time. I was lost in the mazes of my future\r\nfortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together. I\r\nbegged Joe to be comforted, for (as he said) we had ever been the best\r\nof friends, and (as I said) we ever would be so. Joe scooped his eyes\r\nwith his disengaged wrist, as if he were bent on gouging himself, but\r\nsaid not another word.\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognized in Joe the\r\nvillage idiot, and in me his keeper. When it was over, he said, weighing\r\nin his hand the purse he had ceased to swing:--\r\n\r\n"Now, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance. No half\r\nmeasures with me. If you mean to take a present that I have it in charge\r\nto make you, speak out, and you shall have it. If on the contrary you\r\nmean to say--" Here, to his great amazement, he was stopped by Joe\'s\r\nsuddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n"Which I meantersay," cried Joe, "that if you come into my place\r\nbull-baiting and badgering me, come out! Which I meantersay as sech if\r\nyou\'re a man, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay\r\nand stand or fall by!"\r\n\r\nI drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable; merely stating to\r\nme, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any\r\none whom it might happen to concern, that he were not a going to be\r\nbull-baited and badgered in his own place. Mr. Jaggers had risen when\r\nJoe demonstrated, and had backed near the door. Without evincing\r\nany inclination to come in again, he there delivered his valedictory\r\nremarks. They were these.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here--as you are to be a\r\ngentleman--the better. Let it stand for this day week, and you shall\r\nreceive my printed address in the meantime. You can take a hackney-coach\r\nat the stage-coach office in London, and come straight to me.\r\nUnderstand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on the trust\r\nI undertake. I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so. Now, understand\r\nthat, finally. Understand that!"\r\n\r\nHe was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have gone\r\non, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.\r\n\r\nSomething came into my head which induced me to run after him, as he was\r\ngoing down to the Jolly Bargemen, where he had left a hired carriage.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers."\r\n\r\n"Halloa!" said he, facing round, "what\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"I wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions;\r\nso I thought I had better ask. Would there be any objection to my taking\r\nleave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?"\r\n\r\n"No," said he, looking as if he hardly understood me.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean in the village only, but up town?"\r\n\r\n"No," said he. "No objection."\r\n\r\nI thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had already\r\nlocked the front door and vacated the state parlor, and was seated\r\nby the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at the\r\nburning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals,\r\nand nothing was said for a long time.\r\n\r\nMy sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat at her\r\nneedle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next Joe\r\nin the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into the glowing\r\ncoals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the longer the\r\nsilence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.\r\n\r\nAt length I got out, "Joe, have you told Biddy?"\r\n\r\n"No, Pip," returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his\r\nknees tight, as if he had private information that they intended to make\r\noff somewhere, "which I left it to yourself, Pip."\r\n\r\n"I would rather you told, Joe."\r\n\r\n"Pip\'s a gentleman of fortun\' then," said Joe, "and God bless him in\r\nit!"\r\n\r\nBiddy dropped her work, and looked at me. Joe held his knees and looked\r\nat me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both heartily\r\ncongratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their\r\ncongratulations that I rather resented.\r\n\r\nI took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe) with the\r\ngrave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and say\r\nnothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all come out in good\r\ntime, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said, save\r\nthat I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron. Biddy\r\nnodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again,\r\nand said she would be very particular; and Joe, still detaining his\r\nknees, said, "Ay, ay, I\'ll be ekervally partickler, Pip;" and then they\r\ncongratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at the\r\nnotion of my being a gentleman that I didn\'t half like it.\r\n\r\nInfinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some idea\r\nof what had happened. To the best of my belief, those efforts entirely\r\nfailed. She laughed and nodded her head a great many times, and even\r\nrepeated after Biddy, the words "Pip" and "Property." But I doubt if\r\nthey had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I cannot suggest\r\na darker picture of her state of mind.\r\n\r\nI never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and\r\nBiddy became more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.\r\nDissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it is\r\npossible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied\r\nwith myself.\r\n\r\nAny how, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand,\r\nlooking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, and\r\nabout what they should do without me, and all that. And whenever I\r\ncaught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they\r\noften looked at me,--particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if they\r\nwere expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows they never did\r\nby word or sign.\r\n\r\nAt those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchen\r\ndoor opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings to\r\nair the room. The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am afraid\r\nI took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic\r\nobjects among which I had passed my life.\r\n\r\n"Saturday night," said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese\r\nand beer. "Five more days, and then the day before the day! They\'ll soon\r\ngo."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Pip," observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer-mug.\r\n"They\'ll soon go."\r\n\r\n"Soon, soon go," said Biddy.\r\n\r\n"I have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, and\r\norder my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I\'ll come and put\r\nthem on there, or that I\'ll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook\'s. It\r\nwould be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here."\r\n\r\n"Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure\r\ntoo, Pip," said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his cheese on\r\nit, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper\r\nas if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices. "So might\r\nWopsle. And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I don\'t want, Joe. They would make such a business of\r\nit,--such a coarse and common business,--that I couldn\'t bear myself."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that indeed, Pip!" said Joe. "If you couldn\'t abear yourself--"\r\n\r\nBiddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sister\'s plate, "Have you\r\nthought about when you\'ll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister\r\nand me? You will show yourself to us; won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Biddy," I returned with some resentment, "you are so exceedingly quick\r\nthat it\'s difficult to keep up with you."\r\n\r\n("She always were quick," observed Joe.)\r\n\r\n"If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say\r\nthat I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,--most likely\r\non the evening before I go away."\r\n\r\nBiddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged an\r\naffectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed. When I got\r\ninto my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a mean\r\nlittle room that I should soon be parted from and raised above, for\r\never. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even at\r\nthe same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind\r\nbetween it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in\r\nso often between the forge and Miss Havisham\'s, and Biddy and Estella.\r\n\r\nThe sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and\r\nthe room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, I saw\r\nJoe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or two\r\nin the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and light\r\nit for him. He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me that he\r\nwanted comforting, for some reason or other.\r\n\r\nHe presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his pipe,\r\nand Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knew that they\r\ntalked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both\r\nof them more than once. I would not have listened for more, if I could\r\nhave heard more; so I drew away from the window, and sat down in my one\r\nchair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this\r\nfirst night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest I had ever\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nLooking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe\'s pipe\r\nfloating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,--not\r\nobtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared\r\ntogether. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy\r\nbed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX\r\n\r\nMorning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life,\r\nand brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same. What lay\r\nheaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened\r\nbetween me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of\r\na misgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, and\r\nthat, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nJoe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our\r\napproaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did. After\r\nbreakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best\r\nparlor, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free. With\r\nall the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe, and\r\nthought perhaps the clergyman wouldn\'t have read that about the rich man\r\nand the kingdom of Heaven, if he had known all.\r\n\r\nAfter our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off\r\nthe marshes at once, and get them done with. As I passed the church, I\r\nfelt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassion\r\nfor the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after\r\nSunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the\r\nlow green mounds. I promised myself that I would do something for them\r\none of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a\r\ndinner of roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of\r\ncondescension, upon everybody in the village.\r\n\r\nIf I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my\r\ncompanionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among those\r\ngraves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place recalled\r\nthe wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon iron and badge! My\r\ncomfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that he had doubtless\r\nbeen transported a long way off, and that he was dead to me, and might\r\nbe veritably dead into the bargain.\r\n\r\nNo more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of these\r\ngrazing cattle,--though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a\r\nmore respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they\r\nmight stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great\r\nexpectations,--farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood,\r\nhenceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith\'s work in\r\ngeneral, and for you! I made my exultant way to the old Battery, and,\r\nlying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham intended\r\nme for Estella, fell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke, I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me,\r\nsmoking his pipe. He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my\r\neyes, and said,--\r\n\r\n"As being the last time, Pip, I thought I\'d foller."\r\n\r\n"And Joe, I am very glad you did so."\r\n\r\n"Thankee, Pip."\r\n\r\n"You may be sure, dear Joe," I went on, after we had shaken hands, "that\r\nI shall never forget you."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Pip!" said Joe, in a comfortable tone, "I\'m sure of that. Ay,\r\nay, old chap! Bless you, it were only necessary to get it well round in\r\na man\'s mind, to be certain on it. But it took a bit of time to get it\r\nwell round, the change come so oncommon plump; didn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nSomehow, I was not best pleased with Joe\'s being so mightily secure of\r\nme. I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion, or to have said,\r\n"It does you credit, Pip," or something of that sort. Therefore, I made\r\nno remark on Joe\'s first head; merely saying as to his second, that the\r\ntidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a\r\ngentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I\r\nwere one.\r\n\r\n"Have you though?" said Joe. "Astonishing!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity now, Joe," said I, "that you did not get on a little more,\r\nwhen we had our lessons here; isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know," returned Joe. "I\'m so awful dull. I\'m only master\r\nof my own trade. It were always a pity as I was so awful dull; but it\'s\r\nno more of a pity now, than it was--this day twelvemonth--don\'t you\r\nsee?"\r\n\r\nWhat I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able to\r\ndo something for Joe, it would have been much more agreeable if he\r\nhad been better qualified for a rise in station. He was so perfectly\r\ninnocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to\r\nBiddy in preference.\r\n\r\nSo, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into our\r\nlittle garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a\r\ngeneral way for the elevation of her spirits, that I should never forget\r\nher, said I had a favor to ask of her.\r\n\r\n"And it is, Biddy," said I, "that you will not omit any opportunity of\r\nhelping Joe on, a little."\r\n\r\n"How helping him on?" asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance.\r\n\r\n"Well! Joe is a dear good fellow,--in fact, I think he is the dearest\r\nfellow that ever lived,--but he is rather backward in some things. For\r\ninstance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners."\r\n\r\nAlthough I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened her\r\neyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me.\r\n\r\n"O, his manners! won\'t his manners do then?" asked Biddy, plucking a\r\nblack-currant leaf.\r\n\r\n"My dear Biddy, they do very well here--"\r\n\r\n"O! they do very well here?" interrupted Biddy, looking closely at the\r\nleaf in her hand.\r\n\r\n"Hear me out,--but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I\r\nshall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they would\r\nhardly do him justice."\r\n\r\n"And don\'t you think he knows that?" asked Biddy.\r\n\r\nIt was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the most\r\ndistant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly,--\r\n\r\n"Biddy, what do you mean?"\r\n\r\nBiddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,--and the\r\nsmell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening\r\nin the little garden by the side of the lane,--said, "Have you never\r\nconsidered that he may be proud?"\r\n\r\n"Proud?" I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.\r\n\r\n"O! there are many kinds of pride," said Biddy, looking full at me and\r\nshaking her head; "pride is not all of one kind--"\r\n\r\n"Well? What are you stopping for?" said I.\r\n\r\n"Not all of one kind," resumed Biddy. "He may be too proud to let any\r\none take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and fills well\r\nand with respect. To tell you the truth, I think he is; though it sounds\r\nbold in me to say so, for you must know him far better than I do."\r\n\r\n"Now, Biddy," said I, "I am very sorry to see this in you. I did not\r\nexpect to see this in you. You are envious, Biddy, and grudging. You\r\nare dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can\'t help\r\nshowing it."\r\n\r\n"If you have the heart to think so," returned Biddy, "say so. Say so\r\nover and over again, if you have the heart to think so."\r\n\r\n"If you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy," said I, in a virtuous\r\nand superior tone; "don\'t put it off upon me. I am very sorry to see it,\r\nand it\'s a--it\'s a bad side of human nature. I did intend to ask you\r\nto use any little opportunities you might have after I was gone, of\r\nimproving dear Joe. But after this I ask you nothing. I am extremely\r\nsorry to see this in you, Biddy," I repeated. "It\'s a--it\'s a bad side\r\nof human nature."\r\n\r\n"Whether you scold me or approve of me," returned poor Biddy, "you may\r\nequally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here,\r\nat all times. And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make\r\nno difference in my remembrance of you. Yet a gentleman should not be\r\nunjust neither," said Biddy, turning away her head.\r\n\r\nI again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature (in which\r\nsentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to think I\r\nwas right), and I walked down the little path away from Biddy, and\r\nBiddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and took a\r\ndejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very sorrowful and\r\nstrange that this, the second night of my bright fortunes, should be as\r\nlonely and unsatisfactory as the first.\r\n\r\nBut, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency to\r\nBiddy, and we dropped the subject. Putting on the best clothes I had,\r\nI went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open,\r\nand presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor, who was having his\r\nbreakfast in the parlor behind his shop, and who did not think it worth\r\nhis while to come out to me, but called me into him.\r\n\r\n"Well!" said Mr. Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way. "How are\r\nyou, and what can I do for you?"\r\n\r\nMr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather-beds, and was\r\nslipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up. He was a\r\nprosperous old bachelor, and his open window looked into a prosperous\r\nlittle garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe let into\r\nthe wall at the side of his fireplace, and I did not doubt that heaps of\r\nhis prosperity were put away in it in bags.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Trabb," said I, "it\'s an unpleasant thing to have to mention,\r\nbecause it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsome\r\nproperty."\r\n\r\nA change passed over Mr. Trabb. He forgot the butter in bed, got up from\r\nthe bedside, and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming, "Lord\r\nbless my soul!"\r\n\r\n"I am going up to my guardian in London," said I, casually drawing some\r\nguineas out of my pocket and looking at them; "and I want a fashionable\r\nsuit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them," I added--otherwise I\r\nthought he might only pretend to make them, "with ready money."\r\n\r\n"My dear sir," said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, opened\r\nhis arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each\r\nelbow, "don\'t hurt me by mentioning that. May I venture to congratulate\r\nyou? Would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop?"\r\n\r\nMr. Trabb\'s boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side.\r\nWhen I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened his\r\nlabors by sweeping over me. He was still sweeping when I came out into\r\nthe shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possible\r\ncorners and obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality with any\r\nblacksmith, alive or dead.\r\n\r\n"Hold that noise," said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, "or I\'ll\r\nknock your head off!--Do me the favor to be seated, sir. Now, this,"\r\nsaid Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out in a\r\nflowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand under\r\nit to show the gloss, "is a very sweet article. I can recommend it for\r\nyour purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But you shall\r\nsee some others. Give me Number Four, you!" (To the boy, and with a\r\ndreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant\'s\r\nbrushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)\r\n\r\nMr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had\r\ndeposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.\r\nThen he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight. "And let\r\nme have none of your tricks here," said Mr. Trabb, "or you shall repent\r\nit, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live."\r\n\r\nMr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential\r\nconfidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an\r\narticle much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that\r\nit would ever be an honor to him to reflect upon a distinguished\r\nfellow-townsman\'s (if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman) having\r\nworn. "Are you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond," said Mr.\r\nTrabb to the boy after that, "or shall I kick you out of the shop and\r\nbring them myself?"\r\n\r\nI selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb\'s\r\njudgment, and re-entered the parlor to be measured. For although Mr.\r\nTrabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented\r\nwith it, he said apologetically that it "wouldn\'t do under existing\r\ncircumstances, sir,--wouldn\'t do at all." So, Mr. Trabb measured and\r\ncalculated me in the parlor, as if I were an estate and he the finest\r\nspecies of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that\r\nI felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his\r\npains. When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles\r\nto Mr. Pumblechook\'s on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand\r\nupon the parlor lock, "I know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be\r\nexpected to patronize local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a\r\nturn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem\r\nit. Good morning, sir, much obliged.--Door!"\r\n\r\nThe last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what\r\nit meant. But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his\r\nhands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money\r\nwas, that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb\'s boy.\r\n\r\nAfter this memorable event, I went to the hatter\'s, and the bootmaker\'s,\r\nand the hosier\'s, and felt rather like Mother Hubbard\'s dog whose outfit\r\nrequired the services of so many trades. I also went to the coach-office\r\nand took my place for seven o\'clock on Saturday morning. It was\r\nnot necessary to explain everywhere that I had come into a handsome\r\nproperty; but whenever I said anything to that effect, it followed that\r\nthe officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through\r\nthe window by the High Street, and concentrated his mind upon me. When\r\nI had ordered everything I wanted, I directed my steps towards\r\nPumblechook\'s, and, as I approached that gentleman\'s place of business,\r\nI saw him standing at his door.\r\n\r\nHe was waiting for me with great impatience. He had been out early with\r\nthe chaise-cart, and had called at the forge and heard the news. He had\r\nprepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlor, and he too ordered\r\nhis shopman to "come out of the gangway" as my sacred person passed.\r\n\r\n"My dear friend," said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, when\r\nhe and I and the collation were alone, "I give you joy of your good\r\nfortune. Well deserved, well deserved!"\r\n\r\nThis was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way of\r\nexpressing himself.\r\n\r\n"To think," said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me for\r\nsome moments, "that I should have been the humble instrument of leading\r\nup to this, is a proud reward."\r\n\r\nI begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or\r\nhinted, on that point.\r\n\r\n"My dear young friend," said Mr. Pumblechook; "if you will allow me to\r\ncall you so--"\r\n\r\nI murmured "Certainly," and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands again,\r\nand communicated a movement to his waistcoat, which had an emotional\r\nappearance, though it was rather low down, "My dear young friend, rely\r\nupon my doing my little all in your absence, by keeping the fact before\r\nthe mind of Joseph.--Joseph!" said Mr. Pumblechook, in the way of a\r\ncompassionate adjuration. "Joseph!! Joseph!!!" Thereupon he shook his\r\nhead and tapped it, expressing his sense of deficiency in Joseph.\r\n\r\n"But my dear young friend," said Mr. Pumblechook, "you must be hungry,\r\nyou must be exhausted. Be seated. Here is a chicken had round from the\r\nBoar, here is a tongue had round from the Boar, here\'s one or two little\r\nthings had round from the Boar, that I hope you may not despise. But do\r\nI," said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after he had sat\r\ndown, "see afore me, him as I ever sported with in his times of happy\r\ninfancy? And may I--may I--?"\r\n\r\nThis May I, meant might he shake hands? I consented, and he was fervent,\r\nand then sat down again.\r\n\r\n"Here is wine," said Mr. Pumblechook. "Let us drink, Thanks to Fortune,\r\nand may she ever pick out her favorites with equal judgment! And yet I\r\ncannot," said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, "see afore me One--and\r\nlikewise drink to One--without again expressing--May I--may I--?"\r\n\r\nI said he might, and he shook hands with me again, and emptied his glass\r\nand turned it upside down. I did the same; and if I had turned myself\r\nupside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone more direct to\r\nmy head.\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of\r\ntongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now), and\r\ntook, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all. "Ah! poultry,\r\npoultry! You little thought," said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophizing the\r\nfowl in the dish, "when you was a young fledgling, what was in store for\r\nyou. You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this humble\r\nroof for one as--Call it a weakness, if you will," said Mr. Pumblechook,\r\ngetting up again, "but may I? may I--?"\r\n\r\nIt began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might, so\r\nhe did it at once. How he ever did it so often without wounding himself\r\nwith my knife, I don\'t know.\r\n\r\n"And your sister," he resumed, after a little steady eating, "which had\r\nthe honor of bringing you up by hand! It\'s a sad picter, to reflect that\r\nshe\'s no longer equal to fully understanding the honor. May--"\r\n\r\nI saw he was about to come at me again, and I stopped him.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll drink her health," said I.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite flaccid\r\nwith admiration, "that\'s the way you know \'em, sir!" (I don\'t know\r\nwho Sir was, but he certainly was not I, and there was no third person\r\npresent); "that\'s the way you know the noble-minded, sir! Ever forgiving\r\nand ever affable. It might," said the servile Pumblechook, putting down\r\nhis untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, "to a common person,\r\nhave the appearance of repeating--but may I--?"\r\n\r\nWhen he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister. "Let us\r\nnever be blind," said Mr. Pumblechook, "to her faults of temper, but it\r\nis to be hoped she meant well."\r\n\r\nAt about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed in\r\nthe face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.\r\n\r\nI mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes\r\nsent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him. I\r\nmentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village,\r\nand he lauded it to the skies. There was nobody but himself, he\r\nintimated, worthy of my confidence, and--in short, might he? Then he\r\nasked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we\r\nhad gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he\r\nhad ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend? If I had taken\r\nten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that he\r\nnever had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart of\r\nhearts have repudiated the idea. Yet for all that, I remember feeling\r\nconvinced that I had been much mistaken in him, and that he was a\r\nsensible, practical, good-hearted prime fellow.\r\n\r\nBy degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to ask my\r\nadvice in reference to his own affairs. He mentioned that there was an\r\nopportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed\r\ntrade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred\r\nbefore in that or any other neighborhood. What alone was wanting to the\r\nrealization of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital.\r\nThose were the two little words, more capital. Now it appeared to him\r\n(Pumblechook) that if that capital were got into the business, through a\r\nsleeping partner, sir,--which sleeping partner would have nothing to\r\ndo but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever he pleased, and examine\r\nthe books,--and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his\r\npocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,--it appeared to him that that\r\nmight be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with\r\nproperty, which would be worthy of his attention. But what did I think?\r\nHe had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think? I gave it\r\nas my opinion. "Wait a bit!" The united vastness and distinctness of\r\nthis view so struck him, that he no longer asked if he might shake hands\r\nwith me, but said he really must,--and did.\r\n\r\nWe drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and over\r\nagain to keep Joseph up to the mark (I don\'t know what mark), and to\r\nrender me efficient and constant service (I don\'t know what service). He\r\nalso made known to me for the first time in my life, and certainly after\r\nhaving kept his secret wonderfully well, that he had always said of me,\r\n"That boy is no common boy, and mark me, his fortun\' will be no common\r\nfortun\'." He said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to\r\nthink of now, and I said so too. Finally, I went out into the air, with\r\na dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the\r\nsunshine, and found that I had slumberously got to the turnpike without\r\nhaving taken any account of the road.\r\n\r\nThere, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook\'s hailing me. He was a long way\r\ndown the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me to\r\nstop. I stopped, and he came up breathless.\r\n\r\n"No, my dear friend," said he, when he had recovered wind for speech.\r\n"Not if I can help it. This occasion shall not entirely pass without\r\nthat affability on your part.--May I, as an old friend and well-wisher?\r\nMay I?"\r\n\r\nWe shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he ordered a young\r\ncarter out of my way with the greatest indignation. Then, he blessed\r\nme and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the\r\nroad; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge\r\nbefore I pursued my way home.\r\n\r\nI had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the little\r\nI possessed was adapted to my new station. But I began packing that same\r\nafternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want next\r\nmorning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost.\r\n\r\nSo, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning I\r\nwent to Mr. Pumblechook\'s, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to\r\nMiss Havisham. Mr. Pumblechook\'s own room was given up to me to dress\r\nin, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event. My\r\nclothes were rather a disappointment, of course. Probably every new\r\nand eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell\r\na trifle short of the wearer\'s expectation. But after I had had my\r\nnew suit on some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity of\r\nposturing with Mr. Pumblechook\'s very limited dressing-glass, in the\r\nfutile endeavor to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better. It being\r\nmarket morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off, Mr. Pumblechook\r\nwas not at home. I had not told him exactly when I meant to leave, and\r\nwas not likely to shake hands with him again before departing. This was\r\nall as it should be, and I went out in my new array, fearfully ashamed\r\nof having to pass the shopman, and suspicious after all that I was at a\r\npersonal disadvantage, something like Joe\'s in his Sunday suit.\r\n\r\nI went circuitously to Miss Havisham\'s by all the back ways, and rang\r\nat the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of my\r\ngloves. Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back when\r\nshe saw me so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned from\r\nbrown to green and yellow.\r\n\r\n"You?" said she. "You? Good gracious! What do you want?"\r\n\r\n"I am going to London, Miss Pocket," said I, "and want to say good-bye to\r\nMiss Havisham."\r\n\r\nI was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she went\r\nto ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, she returned\r\nand took me up, staring at me all the way.\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread\r\ntable, leaning on her crutch stick. The room was lighted as of yore, and\r\nat the sound of our entrance, she stopped and turned. She was then just\r\nabreast of the rotted bride-cake.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go, Sarah," she said. "Well, Pip?"\r\n\r\n"I start for London, Miss Havisham, to-morrow," I was exceedingly\r\ncareful what I said, "and I thought you would kindly not mind my taking\r\nleave of you."\r\n\r\n"This is a gay figure, Pip," said she, making her crutch stick play\r\nround me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, were\r\nbestowing the finishing gift.\r\n\r\n"I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss\r\nHavisham," I murmured. "And I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!"\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay!" said she, looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, with\r\ndelight. "I have seen Mr. Jaggers. I have heard about it, Pip. So you go\r\nto-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Havisham."\r\n\r\n"And you are adopted by a rich person?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Havisham."\r\n\r\n"Not named?"\r\n\r\n"No, Miss Havisham."\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Havisham."\r\n\r\nShe quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was her\r\nenjoyment of Sarah Pocket\'s jealous dismay. "Well!" she went on; "you\r\nhave a promising career before you. Be good--deserve it--and abide by\r\nMr. Jaggers\'s instructions." She looked at me, and looked at Sarah, and\r\nSarah\'s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile. "Good-bye,\r\nPip!--you will always keep the name of Pip, you know."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Havisham."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Pip!"\r\n\r\nShe stretched out her hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to\r\nmy lips. I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it came\r\nnaturally to me at the moment to do this. She looked at Sarah Pocket\r\nwith triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with\r\nboth her hands on her crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimly\r\nlighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.\r\n\r\nSarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seen\r\nout. She could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degree\r\nconfounded. I said "Good-bye, Miss Pocket;" but she merely stared, and\r\ndid not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken. Clear of the\r\nhouse, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook\'s, took off my new\r\nclothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress,\r\ncarrying it--to speak the truth--much more at my ease too, though I had\r\nthe bundle to carry.\r\n\r\nAnd now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had\r\nrun out fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face more\r\nsteadily than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled\r\naway, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more\r\nappreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I\r\ndressed my self out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my\r\nsplendor until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion, graced by\r\nthe inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish with. We were\r\nall very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits.\r\n\r\nI was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little\r\nhand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all\r\nalone. I am afraid--sore afraid--that this purpose originated in my\r\nsense of the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to\r\nthe coach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing\r\nof this taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room\r\non this last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and\r\nhad an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me\r\nin the morning. I did not.\r\n\r\nAll night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places\r\ninstead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now\r\npigs, now men,--never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied\r\nme until the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and\r\npartly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in\r\ntaking it fell asleep.\r\n\r\nBiddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not\r\nsleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when\r\nI started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon.\r\nBut long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking of the\r\nteacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go downstairs.\r\nAfter all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping\r\nmy small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again, until Biddy\r\ncalled to me that I was late.\r\n\r\nIt was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal,\r\nsaying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,\r\n"Well! I suppose I must be off!" and then I kissed my sister who was\r\nlaughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed\r\nBiddy, and threw my arms around Joe\'s neck. Then I took up my little\r\nportmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I presently\r\nheard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing an old\r\nshoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped then, to\r\nwave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above his head,\r\ncrying huskily "Hooroar!" and Biddy put her apron to her face.\r\n\r\nI walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had\r\nsupposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to\r\nhave had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High\r\nStreet. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very\r\npeaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to\r\nshow me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all\r\nbeyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave\r\nand sob I broke into tears. It was by the finger-post at the end of the\r\nvillage, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, "Good-bye, O my dear, dear\r\nfriend!"\r\n\r\nHeaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain\r\nupon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was\r\nbetter after I had cried than before,--more sorry, more aware of my own\r\ningratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Joe\r\nwith me then.\r\n\r\nSo subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the\r\ncourse of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was clear\r\nof the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get\r\ndown when we changed horses and walk back, and have another evening at\r\nhome, and a better parting. We changed, and I had not made up my mind,\r\nand still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to\r\nget down and walk back, when we changed again. And while I was occupied\r\nwith these deliberations, I would fancy an exact resemblance to Joe\r\nin some man coming along the road towards us, and my heart would beat\r\nhigh.--As if he could possibly be there!\r\n\r\nWe changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to\r\ngo back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and\r\nthe world lay spread before me.\r\n\r\nThis is the end of the first stage of Pip\'s expectations.\r\n\r\nChapter XX\r\n\r\nThe journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five\r\nhours. It was a little past midday when the four-horse stage-coach by\r\nwhich I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about\r\nthe Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London.\r\n\r\nWe Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable\r\nto doubt our having and our being the best of everything: otherwise,\r\nwhile I was scared by the immensity of London, I think I might have had\r\nsome faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly, crooked, narrow, and\r\ndirty.\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, and he\r\nhad written after it on his card, "just out of Smithfield, and close by\r\nthe coach-office." Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed to have\r\nas many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old, packed me\r\nup in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of\r\nsteps, as if he were going to take me fifty miles. His getting on his\r\nbox, which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather-stained\r\npea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a work of time.\r\nIt was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets outside, and ragged\r\nthings behind for I don\'t know how many footmen to hold on by, and\r\na harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the\r\ntemptation.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a\r\nstraw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why\r\nthe horses\' nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman\r\nbeginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently. And stop\r\nwe presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open\r\ndoor, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS.\r\n\r\n"How much?" I asked the coachman.\r\n\r\nThe coachman answered, "A shilling--unless you wish to make it more."\r\n\r\nI naturally said I had no wish to make it more.\r\n\r\n"Then it must be a shilling," observed the coachman. "I don\'t want to\r\nget into trouble. I know him!" He darkly closed an eye at Mr. Jaggers\'s\r\nname, and shook his head.\r\n\r\nWhen he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed the\r\nascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve his\r\nmind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my\r\nhand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?\r\n\r\n"He is not," returned the clerk. "He is in Court at present. Am I\r\naddressing Mr. Pip?"\r\n\r\nI signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Jaggers left word, would you wait in his room. He couldn\'t say how\r\nlong he might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason, his time\r\nbeing valuable, that he won\'t be longer than he can help."\r\n\r\nWith those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner\r\nchamber at the back. Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in a\r\nvelveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his nose with his sleeve on\r\nbeing interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.\r\n\r\n"Go and wait outside, Mike," said the clerk.\r\n\r\nI began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerk\r\nshoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used,\r\nand tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone.\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers\'s room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most dismal\r\nplace; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head, and the\r\ndistorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to\r\npeep down at me through it. There were not so many papers about, as I\r\nshould have expected to see; and there were some odd objects about, that\r\nI should not have expected to see,--such as an old rusty pistol, a\r\nsword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and packages, and\r\ntwo dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly swollen, and twitchy\r\nabout the nose. Mr. Jaggers\'s own high-backed chair was of deadly black\r\nhorsehair, with rows of brass nails round it, like a coffin; and I\r\nfancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and bit his forefinger at\r\nthe clients. The room was but small, and the clients seemed to have had\r\na habit of backing up against the wall; the wall, especially opposite to\r\nMr. Jaggers\'s chair, being greasy with shoulders. I recalled, too, that\r\nthe one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was\r\nthe innocent cause of his being turned out.\r\n\r\nI sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers\'s\r\nchair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I\r\ncalled to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to\r\neverybody else\'s disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how many\r\nother clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have\r\nthe same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what\r\nwas the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came\r\nthere. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers\'s\r\nfamily, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such\r\nill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the\r\nblacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.\r\nOf course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits may\r\nhave been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and grit\r\nthat lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr.\r\nJaggers\'s close room, until I really could not bear the two casts on the\r\nshelf above Mr. Jaggers\'s chair, and got up and went out.\r\n\r\nWhen I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I\r\nwaited, he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into\r\nSmithfield. So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being all\r\nasmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to me. So,\r\nI rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where\r\nI saw the great black dome of Saint Paul\'s bulging at me from behind a\r\ngrim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate Prison. Following\r\nthe wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered with straw to deaden\r\nthe noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and from the quantity of\r\npeople standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer, I inferred\r\nthat the trials were on.\r\n\r\nWhile I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk\r\nminister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a\r\ntrial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place for half a\r\ncrown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice in\r\nhis wig and robes,--mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and\r\npresently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen-pence. As I\r\ndeclined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he was so good as\r\nto take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and also\r\nwhere people were publicly whipped, and then he showed me the Debtors\'\r\nDoor, out of which culprits came to be hanged; heightening the interest\r\nof that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that "four on \'em"\r\nwould come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the\r\nmorning, to be killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me a\r\nsickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice\'s\r\nproprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up again to his\r\npocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes which had evidently\r\nnot belonged to him originally, and which I took it into my head he had\r\nbought cheap of the executioner. Under these circumstances I thought\r\nmyself well rid of him for a shilling.\r\n\r\nI dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and I\r\nfound he had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tour\r\nof Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became\r\naware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well\r\nas I. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew\r\nClose, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the\r\npavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other when\r\nthey first passed me, that "Jaggers would do it if it was to be done."\r\nThere was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and\r\none of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comforted\r\nher by saying, as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, "Jaggers\r\nis for him, \'Melia, and what more could you have?" There was a red-eyed\r\nlittle Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there, in\r\ncompany with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand; and\r\nwhile the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of a highly\r\nexcitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp-post and\r\naccompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with the words, "O Jaggerth,\r\nJaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth, give me Jaggerth!"\r\nThese testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep\r\nimpression on me, and I admired and wondered more than ever.\r\n\r\nAt length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close\r\ninto Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards\r\nme. All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time, and there\r\nwas quite a rush at him. Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder\r\nand walking me on at his side without saying anything to me, addressed\r\nhimself to his followers.\r\n\r\nFirst, he took the two secret men.\r\n\r\n"Now, I have nothing to say to you," said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his\r\nfinger at them. "I want to know no more than I know. As to the result,\r\nit\'s a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have you\r\npaid Wemmick?"\r\n\r\n"We made the money up this morning, sir," said one of the men,\r\nsubmissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it\r\nup at all. Has Wemmick got it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said both the men together.\r\n\r\n"Very well; then you may go. Now, I won\'t have it!" said Mr Jaggers,\r\nwaving his hand at them to put them behind him. "If you say a word to\r\nme, I\'ll throw up the case."\r\n\r\n"We thought, Mr. Jaggers--" one of the men began, pulling off his hat.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I told you not to do," said Mr. Jaggers. "You thought! I\r\nthink for you; that\'s enough for you. If I want you, I know where to\r\nfind you; I don\'t want you to find me. Now I won\'t have it. I won\'t hear\r\na word."\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind\r\nagain, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.\r\n\r\n"And now you!" said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on\r\nthe two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly\r\nseparated,--"Oh! Amelia, is it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Jaggers."\r\n\r\n"And do you remember," retorted Mr. Jaggers, "that but for me you\r\nwouldn\'t be here and couldn\'t be here?"\r\n\r\n"O yes, sir!" exclaimed both women together. "Lord bless you, sir, well\r\nwe knows that!"\r\n\r\n"Then why," said Mr. Jaggers, "do you come here?"\r\n\r\n"My Bill, sir!" the crying woman pleaded.\r\n\r\n"Now, I tell you what!" said Mr. Jaggers. "Once for all. If you don\'t\r\nknow that your Bill\'s in good hands, I know it. And if you come here\r\nbothering about your Bill, I\'ll make an example of both your Bill and\r\nyou, and let him slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?"\r\n\r\n"O yes, sir! Every farden."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say another\r\nword--one single word--and Wemmick shall give you your money back."\r\n\r\nThis terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately.\r\nNo one remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the\r\nskirts of Mr. Jaggers\'s coat to his lips several times.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know this man!" said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating\r\nstrain: "What does this fellow want?"\r\n\r\n"Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?"\r\n\r\n"Who\'s he?" said Mr. Jaggers. "Let go of my coat."\r\n\r\nThe suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing\r\nit, replied, "Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate."\r\n\r\n"You\'re too late," said Mr. Jaggers. "I am over the way."\r\n\r\n"Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth!" cried my excitable acquaintance,\r\nturning white, "don\'t thay you\'re again Habraham Latharuth!"\r\n\r\n"I am," said Mr. Jaggers, "and there\'s an end of it. Get out of the\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"Mithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen\'th gone to Mithter\r\nWemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth. Mithter\r\nJaggerth! Half a quarter of a moment! If you\'d have the condethenthun to\r\nbe bought off from the t\'other thide--at hany thuperior prithe!--money\r\nno object!--Mithter Jaggerth--Mithter--!"\r\n\r\nMy guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference, and\r\nleft him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot. Without further\r\ninterruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk and\r\nthe man in velveteen with the fur cap.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s Mike," said the clerk, getting down from his stool, and\r\napproaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of\r\nhair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling\r\nat the bell-rope; "your man comes on this afternoon. Well?"\r\n\r\n"Well, Mas\'r Jaggers," returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a\r\nconstitutional cold; "arter a deal o\' trouble, I\'ve found one, sir, as\r\nmight do."\r\n\r\n"What is he prepared to swear?"\r\n\r\n"Well, Mas\'r Jaggers," said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap this\r\ntime; "in a general way, anythink."\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. "Now, I warned you before," said\r\nhe, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, "that if you ever\r\npresumed to talk in that way here, I\'d make an example of you. You\r\ninfernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?"\r\n\r\nThe client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he were unconscious\r\nwhat he had done.\r\n\r\n"Spooney!" said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with his\r\nelbow. "Soft Head! Need you say it face to face?"\r\n\r\n"Now, I ask you, you blundering booby," said my guardian, very sternly,\r\n"once more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here is\r\nprepared to swear?"\r\n\r\nMike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a lesson\r\nfrom his face, and slowly replied, "Ayther to character, or to having\r\nbeen in his company and never left him all the night in question."\r\n\r\n"Now, be careful. In what station of life is this man?"\r\n\r\nMike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the\r\nceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before\r\nbeginning to reply in a nervous manner, "We\'ve dressed him up like--"\r\nwhen my guardian blustered out,--\r\n\r\n"What? You WILL, will you?"\r\n\r\n("Spooney!" added the clerk again, with another stir.)\r\n\r\nAfter some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:--\r\n\r\n"He is dressed like a \'spectable pieman. A sort of a pastry-cook."\r\n\r\n"Is he here?" asked my guardian.\r\n\r\n"I left him," said Mike, "a setting on some doorsteps round the corner."\r\n\r\n"Take him past that window, and let me see him."\r\n\r\nThe window indicated was the office window. We all three went to\r\nit, behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an\r\naccidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a short\r\nsuit of white linen and a paper cap. This guileless confectioner was not\r\nby any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery,\r\nwhich was painted over.\r\n\r\n"Tell him to take his witness away directly," said my guardian to the\r\nclerk, in extreme disgust, "and ask him what he means by bringing such a\r\nfellow as that."\r\n\r\nMy guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched,\r\nstanding, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry (he seemed to\r\nbully his very sandwich as he ate it), informed me what arrangements he\r\nhad made for me. I was to go to "Barnard\'s Inn," to young Mr. Pocket\'s\r\nrooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I was to\r\nremain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go with\r\nhim to his father\'s house on a visit, that I might try how I liked it.\r\nAlso, I was told what my allowance was to be,--it was a very liberal\r\none,--and had handed to me from one of my guardian\'s drawers, the cards\r\nof certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes,\r\nand such other things as I could in reason want. "You will find your\r\ncredit good, Mr. Pip," said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt\r\nlike a whole caskful, as he hastily refreshed himself, "but I shall by\r\nthis means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find you\r\noutrunning the constable. Of course you\'ll go wrong somehow, but that\'s\r\nno fault of mine."\r\n\r\nAfter I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked\r\nMr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He said it was not worth while,\r\nI was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me, if I\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nI then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerk\r\nwas rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out, and I\r\naccompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.\r\nWe found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way\r\namong them by saying coolly yet decisively, "I tell you it\'s no use; he\r\nwon\'t have a word to say to one of you;" and we soon got clear of them,\r\nand went on side by side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI\r\n\r\nCasting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he was\r\nlike in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short in\r\nstature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have been\r\nimperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were some marks\r\nin it that might have been dimples, if the material had been softer and\r\nthe instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints. The chisel\r\nhad made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose,\r\nbut had given them up without an effort to smooth them off. I judged him\r\nto be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen, and he appeared\r\nto have sustained a good many bereavements; for he wore at least four\r\nmourning rings, besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping\r\nwillow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too, that several rings\r\nand seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he were quite laden with\r\nremembrances of departed friends. He had glittering eyes,--small, keen,\r\nand black,--and thin wide mottled lips. He had had them, to the best of\r\nmy belief, from forty to fifty years.\r\n\r\n"So you were never in London before?" said Mr. Wemmick to me.\r\n\r\n"No," said I.\r\n\r\n"I was new here once," said Mr. Wemmick. "Rum to think of now!"\r\n\r\n"You are well acquainted with it now?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes," said Mr. Wemmick. "I know the moves of it."\r\n\r\n"Is it a very wicked place?" I asked, more for the sake of saying\r\nsomething than for information.\r\n\r\n"You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there are\r\nplenty of people anywhere, who\'ll do that for you."\r\n\r\n"If there is bad blood between you and them," said I, to soften it off a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n"O! I don\'t know about bad blood," returned Mr. Wemmick; "there\'s not\r\nmuch bad blood about. They\'ll do it, if there\'s anything to be got by\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"That makes it worse."\r\n\r\n"You think so?" returned Mr. Wemmick. "Much about the same, I should\r\nsay."\r\n\r\nHe wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before him:\r\nwalking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the streets\r\nto claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of a mouth\r\nthat he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the top of\r\nHolborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance,\r\nand that he was not smiling at all.\r\n\r\n"Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?" I asked Mr. Wemmick.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said he, nodding in the direction. "At Hammersmith, west of\r\nLondon."\r\n\r\n"Is that far?"\r\n\r\n"Well! Say five miles."\r\n\r\n"Do you know him?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you\'re a regular cross-examiner!" said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me\r\nwith an approving air. "Yes, I know him. I know him!"\r\n\r\nThere was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of\r\nthese words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways\r\nat his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text,\r\nwhen he said here we were at Barnard\'s Inn. My depression was not\r\nalleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment\r\nto be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town\r\nwas a mere public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied\r\nspirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby\r\nbuildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for\r\nTom-cats.\r\n\r\nWe entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an\r\nintroductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me\r\nlike a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in\r\nit, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the most\r\ndismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever seen. I\r\nthought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were\r\ndivided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain, crippled\r\nflower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable makeshift; while\r\nTo Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms, as if no new\r\nwretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were\r\nbeing slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants\r\nand their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy mourning of soot\r\nand smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard, and it had strewn\r\nashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere\r\ndust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry rot and wet rot and all\r\nthe silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar,--rot of rat\r\nand mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand besides--addressed\r\nthemselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned, "Try Barnard\'s\r\nMixture."\r\n\r\nSo imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations,\r\nthat I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. "Ah!" said he, mistaking me;\r\n"the retirement reminds you of the country. So it does me."\r\n\r\nHe led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,--which\r\nappeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of\r\nthose days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find\r\nthemselves without the means of coming down,--to a set of chambers on\r\nthe top floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was\r\na label on the letter-box, "Return shortly."\r\n\r\n"He hardly thought you\'d come so soon," Mr. Wemmick explained. "You\r\ndon\'t want me any more?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," said I.\r\n\r\n"As I keep the cash," Mr. Wemmick observed, "we shall most likely meet\r\npretty often. Good day."\r\n\r\n"Good day."\r\n\r\nI put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he\r\nthought I wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said, correcting\r\nhimself,--\r\n\r\n"To be sure! Yes. You\'re in the habit of shaking hands?"\r\n\r\nI was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion,\r\nbut said yes.\r\n\r\n"I have got so out of it!" said Mr. Wemmick,--"except at last. Very\r\nglad, I\'m sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!"\r\n\r\nWhen we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window\r\nand had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it\r\ncame down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had not\r\nput my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view\r\nof the Inn through the window\'s encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully\r\nlooking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket, Junior\'s, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly\r\nmaddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written\r\nmy name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the\r\nwindow, before I heard footsteps on the stairs. Gradually there arose\r\nbefore me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a\r\nmember of society of about my own standing. He had a paper-bag under\r\neach arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Pip?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Pocket?" said I.\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" he exclaimed. "I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a\r\ncoach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would\r\ncome by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,--not\r\nthat that is any excuse,--for I thought, coming from the country, you\r\nmight like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden\r\nMarket to get it good."\r\n\r\nFor a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my\r\nhead. I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think this\r\nwas a dream.\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" said Mr. Pocket, Junior. "This door sticks so!"\r\n\r\nAs he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while\r\nthe paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to hold\r\nthem. He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with\r\nthe door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last,\r\nthat he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite\r\ndoor, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start out\r\nof my head, and as if this must be a dream.\r\n\r\n"Pray come in," said Mr. Pocket, Junior. "Allow me to lead the way. I am\r\nrather bare here, but I hope you\'ll be able to make out tolerably well\r\ntill Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably through\r\nto-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk about\r\nLondon. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As to our\r\ntable, you won\'t find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied from our\r\ncoffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your expense,\r\nsuch being Mr. Jaggers\'s directions. As to our lodging, it\'s not by\r\nany means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my father\r\nhasn\'t anything to give me, and I shouldn\'t be willing to take it, if he\r\nhad. This is our sitting-room,--just such chairs and tables and carpet\r\nand so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You mustn\'t give\r\nme credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors, because they come\r\nfor you from the coffee-house. This is my little bedroom; rather musty,\r\nbut Barnard\'s is musty. This is your bedroom; the furniture\'s hired for\r\nthe occasion, but I trust it will answer the purpose; if you should want\r\nanything, I\'ll go and fetch it. The chambers are retired, and we shall\r\nbe alone together, but we shan\'t fight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg\r\nyour pardon, you\'re holding the fruit all this time. Pray let me take\r\nthese bags from you. I am quite ashamed."\r\n\r\nAs I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags, One,\r\nTwo, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I knew to\r\nbe in mine, and he said, falling back,--\r\n\r\n"Lord bless me, you\'re the prowling boy!"\r\n\r\n"And you," said I, "are the pale young gentleman!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII\r\n\r\nThe pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in\r\nBarnard\'s Inn, until we both burst out laughing. "The idea of its\r\nbeing you!" said he. "The idea of its being you!" said I. And then we\r\ncontemplated one another afresh, and laughed again. "Well!" said the\r\npale young gentleman, reaching out his hand good-humoredly, "it\'s all\r\nover now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you\'ll forgive me\r\nfor having knocked you about so."\r\n\r\nI derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert was the\r\npale young gentleman\'s name) still rather confounded his intention with\r\nhis execution. But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly.\r\n\r\n"You hadn\'t come into your good fortune at that time?" said Herbert\r\nPocket.\r\n\r\n"No," said I.\r\n\r\n"No," he acquiesced: "I heard it had happened very lately. I was rather\r\non the lookout for good fortune then."\r\n\r\n"Indeed?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancy to\r\nme. But she couldn\'t,--at all events, she didn\'t."\r\n\r\nI thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.\r\n\r\n"Bad taste," said Herbert, laughing, "but a fact. Yes, she had sent for\r\nme on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I\r\nsuppose I should have been provided for; perhaps I should have been\r\nwhat-you-may-called it to Estella."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" I asked, with sudden gravity.\r\n\r\nHe was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his\r\nattention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word.\r\n"Affianced," he explained, still busy with the fruit. "Betrothed.\r\nEngaged. What\'s-his-named. Any word of that sort."\r\n\r\n"How did you bear your disappointment?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" said he, "I didn\'t care much for it. She\'s a Tartar."\r\n\r\n"Miss Havisham?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say no to that, but I meant Estella. That girl\'s hard and\r\nhaughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by\r\nMiss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex."\r\n\r\n"What relation is she to Miss Havisham?"\r\n\r\n"None," said he. "Only adopted."\r\n\r\n"Why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex? What revenge?"\r\n\r\n"Lord, Mr. Pip!" said he. "Don\'t you know?"\r\n\r\n"No," said I.\r\n\r\n"Dear me! It\'s quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time. And\r\nnow let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you come\r\nthere, that day?"\r\n\r\nI told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst\r\nout laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didn\'t\r\nask him if he was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?" he went on.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"You know he is Miss Havisham\'s man of business and solicitor, and has\r\nher confidence when nobody else has?"\r\n\r\nThis was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I answered with\r\na constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggers\r\nin Miss Havisham\'s house on the very day of our combat, but never at any\r\nother time, and that I believed he had no recollection of having ever\r\nseen me there.\r\n\r\n"He was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he\r\ncalled on my father to propose it. Of course he knew about my father\r\nfrom his connection with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havisham\'s\r\ncousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he\r\nis a bad courtier and will not propitiate her."\r\n\r\nHerbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking.\r\nI had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since,\r\nwho more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural\r\nincapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something\r\nwonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the\r\nsame time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich. I\r\ndon\'t know how this was. I became imbued with the notion on that first\r\noccasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nHe was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered languor\r\nabout him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that did not seem\r\nindicative of natural strength. He had not a handsome face, but it was\r\nbetter than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful. His figure\r\nwas a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had taken such\r\nliberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be light and\r\nyoung. Whether Mr. Trabb\'s local work would have sat more gracefully on\r\nhim than on me, may be a question; but I am conscious that he carried\r\noff his rather old clothes much better than I carried off my new suit.\r\n\r\nAs he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a\r\nbad return unsuited to our years. I therefore told him my small story,\r\nand laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was.\r\nI further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a\r\ncountry place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would\r\ntake it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever\r\nhe saw me at a loss or going wrong.\r\n\r\n"With pleasure," said he, "though I venture to prophesy that you\'ll want\r\nvery few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I should like\r\nto banish any needless restraint between us. Will you do me the favour\r\nto begin at once to call me by my Christian name, Herbert?"\r\n\r\nI thanked him and said I would. I informed him in exchange that my\r\nChristian name was Philip.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t take to Philip," said he, smiling, "for it sounds like a moral\r\nboy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond,\r\nor so fat that he couldn\'t see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that\r\nhe locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a\r\nbird\'s-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the\r\nneighborhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious, and\r\nyou have been a blacksmith,---would you mind it?"\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t mind anything that you propose," I answered, "but I don\'t\r\nunderstand you."\r\n\r\n"Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There\'s a charming piece of\r\nmusic by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith."\r\n\r\n"I should like it very much."\r\n\r\n"Then, my dear Handel," said he, turning round as the door opened,\r\n"here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the table,\r\nbecause the dinner is of your providing."\r\n\r\nThis I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It was a\r\nnice little dinner,--seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor\'s Feast,--and\r\nit acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent\r\ncircumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.\r\nThis again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the\r\nbanquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have\r\nsaid, the lap of luxury,--being entirely furnished forth from the\r\ncoffee-house,--the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a\r\ncomparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter\r\nthe wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he\r\nfell over them), the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on the\r\nbookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into my\r\nbed in the next room,--where I found much of its parsley and butter in\r\na state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this made the\r\nfeast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my\r\npleasure was without alloy.\r\n\r\nWe had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of his\r\npromise to tell me about Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n"True," he replied. "I\'ll redeem it at once. Let me introduce the topic,\r\nHandel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put the\r\nknife in the mouth,--for fear of accidents,--and that while the fork is\r\nreserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary. It is\r\nscarcely worth mentioning, only it\'s as well to do as other people do.\r\nAlso, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. This has\r\ntwo advantages. You get at your mouth better (which after all is the\r\nobject), and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters, on\r\nthe part of the right elbow."\r\n\r\nHe offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we both\r\nlaughed and I scarcely blushed.\r\n\r\n"Now," he pursued, "concerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must\r\nknow, was a spoilt child. Her mother died when she was a baby, and her\r\nfather denied her nothing. Her father was a country gentleman down in\r\nyour part of the world, and was a brewer. I don\'t know why it should\r\nbe a crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you\r\ncannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was\r\nand brew. You see it every day."\r\n\r\n"Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?" said I.\r\n\r\n"Not on any account," returned Herbert; "but a public-house may keep a\r\ngentleman. Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was his\r\ndaughter."\r\n\r\n"Miss Havisham was an only child?" I hazarded.\r\n\r\n"Stop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she was not an only child;\r\nshe had a half-brother. Her father privately married again--his cook, I\r\nrather think."\r\n\r\n"I thought he was proud," said I.\r\n\r\n"My good Handel, so he was. He married his second wife privately,\r\nbecause he was proud, and in course of time she died. When she was dead,\r\nI apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and then\r\nthe son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are\r\nacquainted with. As the son grew a young man, he turned out riotous,\r\nextravagant, undutiful,--altogether bad. At last his father disinherited\r\nhim; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though\r\nnot nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.--Take another glass of wine,\r\nand excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one\r\nto be so strictly conscientious in emptying one\'s glass, as to turn it\r\nbottom upwards with the rim on one\'s nose."\r\n\r\nI had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. I\r\nthanked him, and apologized. He said, "Not at all," and resumed.\r\n\r\n"Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after\r\nas a great match. Her half-brother had now ample means again, but what\r\nwith debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again.\r\nThere were stronger differences between him and her than there had been\r\nbetween him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished a deep\r\nand mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father\'s anger.\r\nNow, I come to the cruel part of the story,--merely breaking off, my\r\ndear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a tumbler."\r\n\r\nWhy I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to\r\nsay. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a\r\nmuch better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it\r\nwithin those limits. Again I thanked him and apologized, and again he\r\nsaid in the cheerfullest manner, "Not at all, I am sure!" and resumed.\r\n\r\n"There appeared upon the scene--say at the races, or the public\r\nballs, or anywhere else you like--a certain man, who made love to Miss\r\nHavisham. I never saw him (for this happened five-and-twenty years ago,\r\nbefore you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention that\r\nhe was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he was\r\nnot to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a gentleman, my\r\nfather most strongly asseverates; because it is a principle of his that\r\nno man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever was, since the world\r\nbegan, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no varnish can hide the\r\ngrain of the wood; and that the more varnish you put on, the more the\r\ngrain will express itself. Well! This man pursued Miss Havisham closely,\r\nand professed to be devoted to her. I believe she had not shown much\r\nsusceptibility up to that time; but all the susceptibility she possessed\r\ncertainly came out then, and she passionately loved him. There is no\r\ndoubt that she perfectly idolized him. He practised on her affection in\r\nthat systematic way, that he got great sums of money from her, and he\r\ninduced her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery (which had\r\nbeen weakly left him by his father) at an immense price, on the plea\r\nthat when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all. Your\r\nguardian was not at that time in Miss Havisham\'s counsels, and she was\r\ntoo haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one. Her relations\r\nwere poor and scheming, with the exception of my father; he was poor\r\nenough, but not time-serving or jealous. The only independent one among\r\nthem, he warned her that she was doing too much for this man, and\r\nwas placing herself too unreservedly in his power. She took the first\r\nopportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house, in his\r\npresence, and my father has never seen her since."\r\n\r\nI thought of her having said, "Matthew will come and see me at last when\r\nI am laid dead upon that table;" and I asked Herbert whether his father\r\nwas so inveterate against her?\r\n\r\n"It\'s not that," said he, "but she charged him, in the presence of her\r\nintended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon\r\nher for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it would\r\nlook true--even to him--and even to her. To return to the man and make\r\nan end of him. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were\r\nbought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were\r\ninvited. The day came, but not the bridegroom. He wrote her a letter--"\r\n\r\n"Which she received," I struck in, "when she was dressing for her\r\nmarriage? At twenty minutes to nine?"\r\n\r\n"At the hour and minute," said Herbert, nodding, "at which she\r\nafterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that\r\nit most heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can\'t tell you, because I\r\ndon\'t know. When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she\r\nlaid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has never since\r\nlooked upon the light of day."\r\n\r\n"Is that all the story?" I asked, after considering it.\r\n\r\n"All I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it\r\nout for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when Miss\r\nHavisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was\r\nabsolutely requisite I should understand. But I have forgotten one\r\nthing. It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced\r\nconfidence acted throughout in concert with her half-brother; that it\r\nwas a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits."\r\n\r\n"I wonder he didn\'t marry her and get all the property," said I.\r\n\r\n"He may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may have\r\nbeen a part of her half-brother\'s scheme," said Herbert. "Mind! I don\'t\r\nknow that."\r\n\r\n"What became of the two men?" I asked, after again considering the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n"They fell into deeper shame and degradation--if there can be\r\ndeeper--and ruin."\r\n\r\n"Are they alive now?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"You said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, but\r\nadopted. When adopted?"\r\n\r\nHerbert shrugged his shoulders. "There has always been an Estella, since\r\nI have heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. And now, Handel," said\r\nhe, finally throwing off the story as it were, "there is a perfectly\r\nopen understanding between us. All that I know about Miss Havisham, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"And all that I know," I retorted, "you know."\r\n\r\n"I fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity\r\nbetween you and me. And as to the condition on which you hold your\r\nadvancement in life,--namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to\r\nwhom you owe it,--you may be very sure that it will never be encroached\r\nupon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me."\r\n\r\nIn truth, he said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject\r\ndone with, even though I should be under his father\'s roof for years and\r\nyears to come. Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that I felt\r\nhe as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as I\r\nunderstood the fact myself.\r\n\r\nIt had not occurred to me before, that he had led up to the theme for\r\nthe purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much the\r\nlighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this\r\nto be the case. We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in the\r\ncourse of conversation, what he was? He replied, "A capitalist,--an\r\nInsurer of Ships." I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search\r\nof some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he added, "In the City."\r\n\r\nI had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in\r\nthe City, and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer\r\non his back, blackened his enterprising eye, and cut his responsible\r\nhead open. But again there came upon me, for my relief, that odd\r\nimpression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich.\r\n\r\n"I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring\r\nships. I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut into the\r\nDirection. I shall also do a little in the mining way. None of these\r\nthings will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own\r\naccount. I think I shall trade," said he, leaning back in his chair, "to\r\nthe East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, and precious\r\nwoods. It\'s an interesting trade."\r\n\r\n"And the profits are large?" said I.\r\n\r\n"Tremendous!" said he.\r\n\r\nI wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than\r\nmy own.\r\n\r\n"I think I shall trade, also," said he, putting his thumbs in his\r\nwaist-coat pockets, "to the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum.\r\nAlso to Ceylon, specially for elephants\' tusks."\r\n\r\n"You will want a good many ships," said I.\r\n\r\n"A perfect fleet," said he.\r\n\r\nQuite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I asked him\r\nwhere the ships he insured mostly traded to at present?\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t begun insuring yet," he replied. "I am looking about me."\r\n\r\nSomehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard\'s Inn. I said\r\n(in a tone of conviction), "Ah-h!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I am in a counting-house, and looking about me."\r\n\r\n"Is a counting-house profitable?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"To--do you mean to the young fellow who\'s in it?" he asked, in reply.\r\n\r\n"Yes; to you."\r\n\r\n"Why, n-no; not to me." He said this with the air of one carefully\r\nreckoning up and striking a balance. "Not directly profitable. That is,\r\nit doesn\'t pay me anything, and I have to--keep myself."\r\n\r\nThis certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head as\r\nif I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative\r\ncapital from such a source of income.\r\n\r\n"But the thing is," said Herbert Pocket, "that you look about you.\r\nThat\'s the grand thing. You are in a counting-house, you know, and you\r\nlook about you."\r\n\r\nIt struck me as a singular implication that you couldn\'t be out of a\r\ncounting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferred to\r\nhis experience.\r\n\r\n"Then the time comes," said Herbert, "when you see your opening. And you\r\ngo in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then there\r\nyou are! When you have once made your capital, you have nothing to do\r\nbut employ it."\r\n\r\nThis was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden;\r\nvery like. His manner of bearing his poverty, too, exactly corresponded\r\nto his manner of bearing that defeat. It seemed to me that he took all\r\nblows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine\r\nthen. It was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest\r\nnecessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been\r\nsent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else.\r\n\r\nYet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, he was so\r\nunassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being\r\npuffed up. It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways,\r\nand we got on famously. In the evening we went out for a walk in the\r\nstreets, and went half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went to\r\nchurch at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in the\r\nParks; and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joe did.\r\n\r\nOn a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had\r\nleft Joe and Biddy. The space interposed between myself and them partook\r\nof that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off. That I could\r\nhave been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, on the very\r\nlast Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of impossibilities,\r\ngeographical and social, solar and lunar. Yet in the London streets so\r\ncrowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening,\r\nthere were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor\r\nold kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of night, the footsteps\r\nof some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about Barnard\'s Inn,\r\nunder pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my heart.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to\r\nthe counting-house to report himself,--to look about him, too, I\r\nsuppose,--and I bore him company. He was to come away in an hour or\r\ntwo to attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him. It\r\nappeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched were\r\nincubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging from the\r\nplaces to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning. Nor\r\ndid the counting-house where Herbert assisted, show in my eyes as at\r\nall a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard, of a grimy\r\npresence in all particulars, and with a look into another back second\r\nfloor, rather than a look out.\r\n\r\nI waited about until it was noon, and I went upon \'Change, and I saw\r\nfluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to\r\nbe great merchants, though I couldn\'t understand why they should all be\r\nout of spirits. When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a celebrated\r\nhouse which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have been the\r\nmost abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help noticing,\r\neven then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives\r\nand waiters\' clothes, than in the steaks. This collation disposed of at\r\na moderate price (considering the grease, which was not charged for), we\r\nwent back to Barnard\'s Inn and got my little portmanteau, and then took\r\ncoach for Hammersmith. We arrived there at two or three o\'clock in\r\nthe afternoon, and had very little way to walk to Mr. Pocket\'s house.\r\nLifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct into a little garden\r\noverlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket\'s children were playing\r\nabout. And unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or\r\nprepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr. and Mrs.\r\nPocket\'s children were not growing up or being brought up, but were\r\ntumbling up.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with\r\nher legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket\'s two nurse-maids\r\nwere looking about them while the children played. "Mamma," said\r\nHerbert, "this is young Mr. Pip." Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me\r\nwith an appearance of amiable dignity.\r\n\r\n"Master Alick and Miss Jane," cried one of the nurses to two of the\r\nchildren, "if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you\'ll fall over\r\ninto the river and be drownded, and what\'ll your pa say then?"\r\n\r\nAt the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket\'s handkerchief, and\r\nsaid, "If that don\'t make six times you\'ve dropped it, Mum!" Upon which\r\nMrs. Pocket laughed and said, "Thank you, Flopson," and settling herself\r\nin one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenance immediately assumed\r\na knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week,\r\nbut before she could have read half a dozen lines, she fixed her eyes\r\nupon me, and said, "I hope your mamma is quite well?" This unexpected\r\ninquiry put me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the\r\nabsurdest way that if there had been any such person I had no doubt she\r\nwould have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and\r\nwould have sent her compliments, when the nurse came to my rescue.\r\n\r\n"Well!" she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, "if that don\'t\r\nmake seven times! What ARE you a doing of this afternoon, Mum!" Mrs.\r\nPocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterable\r\nsurprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of\r\nrecognition, and said, "Thank you, Flopson," and forgot me, and went on\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nI found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than\r\nsix little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had\r\nscarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the region\r\nof air, wailing dolefully.\r\n\r\n"If there ain\'t Baby!" said Flopson, appearing to think it most\r\nsurprising. "Make haste up, Millers."\r\n\r\nMillers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by degrees\r\nthe child\'s wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a young\r\nventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read all the\r\ntime, and I was curious to know what the book could be.\r\n\r\nWe were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at any\r\nrate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the\r\nremarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed\r\nnear Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and\r\ntumbled over her,--always very much to her momentary astonishment, and\r\ntheir own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for\r\nthis surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to\r\nspeculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,\r\nwhich baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.\r\nPocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby\r\nand all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.\r\n\r\n"Gracious me, Flopson!" said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a\r\nmoment, "everybody\'s tumbling!"\r\n\r\n"Gracious you, indeed, Mum!" returned Flopson, very red in the face;\r\n"what have you got there?"\r\n\r\n"I got here, Flopson?" asked Mrs. Pocket.\r\n\r\n"Why, if it ain\'t your footstool!" cried Flopson. "And if you keep it\r\nunder your skirts like that, who\'s to help tumbling? Here! Take the\r\nbaby, Mum, and give me your book."\r\n\r\nMrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a\r\nlittle in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had\r\nlasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders\r\nthat they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made the\r\nsecond discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the little\r\nPockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the children\r\ninto the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket came out\r\nof it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to find that Mr.\r\nPocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face, and\r\nwith his very gray hair disordered on his head, as if he didn\'t quite\r\nsee his way to putting anything straight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket said he was glad to see me, and he hoped I was not sorry to\r\nsee him. "For, I really am not," he added, with his son\'s smile,\r\n"an alarming personage." He was a young-looking man, in spite of\r\nhis perplexities and his very gray hair, and his manner seemed quite\r\nnatural. I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected;\r\nthere was something comic in his distraught way, as though it would have\r\nbeen downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very\r\nnear being so. When he had talked with me a little, he said to Mrs.\r\nPocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, which were\r\nblack and handsome, "Belinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?" And she\r\nlooked up from her book, and said, "Yes." She then smiled upon me in an\r\nabsent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of orange-flower\r\nwater? As the question had no bearing, near or remote, on any foregone\r\nor subsequent transaction, I consider it to have been thrown out, like\r\nher previous approaches, in general conversational condescension.\r\n\r\nI found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs.\r\nPocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased\r\nKnight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased\r\nfather would have been made a Baronet but for somebody\'s determined\r\nopposition arising out of entirely personal motives,--I forget whose,\r\nif I ever knew,--the Sovereign\'s, the Prime Minister\'s, the Lord\r\nChancellor\'s, the Archbishop of Canterbury\'s, anybody\'s,--and had\r\ntacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite\r\nsupposititious fact. I believe he had been knighted himself for storming\r\nthe English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate address\r\nengrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of\r\nsome building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage either the\r\ntrowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had directed Mrs. Pocket to\r\nbe brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things\r\nmust marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of\r\nplebeian domestic knowledge.\r\n\r\nSo successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady\r\nby this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but\r\nperfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed,\r\nin the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was\r\nalso in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to mount\r\nto the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doing the\r\none or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket had\r\ntaken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it would\r\nseem to have wanted cutting), and had married without the knowledge of\r\nthe judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothing to bestow or\r\nwithhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that dower upon them\r\nafter a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket that his wife was "a\r\ntreasure for a Prince." Mr. Pocket had invested the Prince\'s treasure\r\nin the ways of the world ever since, and it was supposed to have brought\r\nhim in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs. Pocket was in general the\r\nobject of a queer sort of respectful pity, because she had not married\r\na title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving\r\nreproach, because he had never got one.\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a\r\npleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for\r\nmy own private sitting-room. He then knocked at the doors of two other\r\nsimilar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle\r\nand Startop. Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order of\r\narchitecture, was whistling. Startop, younger in years and appearance,\r\nwas reading and holding his head, as if he thought himself in danger of\r\nexploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody\r\nelse\'s hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house\r\nand let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be the\r\nservants. It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of saving\r\ntrouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the servants\r\nfelt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and\r\ndrinking, and to keep a deal of company downstairs. They allowed a very\r\nliberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it always appeared to me that\r\nby far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been\r\nthe kitchen,--always supposing the boarder capable of self-defence, for,\r\nbefore I had been there a week, a neighboring lady with whom the family\r\nwere personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that she had seen Millers\r\nslapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs. Pocket, who burst into\r\ntears on receiving the note, and said that it was an extraordinary thing\r\nthat the neighbors couldn\'t mind their own business.\r\n\r\nBy degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been\r\neducated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguished himself;\r\nbut that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket very\r\nearly in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling\r\nof a Grinder. After grinding a number of dull blades,--of whom it was\r\nremarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always going to\r\nhelp him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the blades had\r\nleft the Grindstone,--he had wearied of that poor work and had come to\r\nLondon. Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, he had "read"\r\nwith divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them, and had\r\nrefurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turned his\r\nacquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction,\r\nand on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, still\r\nmaintained the house I saw.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbor; a widow lady of that highly\r\nsympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed everybody,\r\nand shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances. This\r\nlady\'s name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honor of taking her down to\r\ndinner on the day of my installation. She gave me to understand on the\r\nstairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr. Pocket\r\nshould be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him.\r\nThat did not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love and confidence\r\n(at that time, I had known her something less than five minutes); if\r\nthey were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.\r\n\r\n"But dear Mrs. Pocket," said Mrs. Coiler, "after her early\r\ndisappointment (not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that), requires\r\nso much luxury and elegance--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am," I said, to stop her, for I was afraid she was going to\r\ncry.\r\n\r\n"And she is of so aristocratic a disposition--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am," I said again, with the same object as before.\r\n\r\n"--That it is hard," said Mrs. Coiler, "to have dear Mr. Pocket\'s time\r\nand attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket."\r\n\r\nI could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher\'s time\r\nand attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said nothing,\r\nand indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\nIt came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and\r\nDrummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and\r\nother instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian\r\nname was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy.\r\nIt further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the\r\ngarden was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which\r\nher grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come at all.\r\nDrummle didn\'t say much, but in his limited way (he struck me as a sulky\r\nkind of fellow) he spoke as one of the elect, and recognized Mrs. Pocket\r\nas a woman and a sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler the toady\r\nneighbor showed any interest in this part of the conversation, and it\r\nappeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but it promised to last\r\na long time, when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic\r\naffliction. It was, in effect, that the cook had mislaid the beef. To my\r\nunutterable amazement, I now, for the first time, saw Mr. Pocket\r\nrelieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very\r\nextraordinary, but which made no impression on anybody else, and\r\nwith which I soon became as familiar as the rest. He laid down the\r\ncarving-knife and fork,--being engaged in carving, at the moment,--put\r\nhis two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to make an\r\nextraordinary effort to lift himself up by it. When he had done this,\r\nand had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly went on with what he\r\nwas about.\r\n\r\nMrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me. I liked\r\nit for a few moments, but she flattered me so very grossly that the\r\npleasure was soon over. She had a serpentine way of coming close at\r\nme when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and\r\nlocalities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and\r\nwhen she made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very little to\r\nher), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them for being on\r\nthe opposite side of the table.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made admiring\r\ncomments on their eyes, noses, and legs,--a sagacious way of improving\r\ntheir minds. There were four little girls, and two little boys, besides\r\nthe baby who might have been either, and the baby\'s next successor who\r\nwas as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson and Millers, much as\r\nthough those two non-commissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere\r\nfor children and had enlisted these, while Mrs. Pocket looked at the\r\nyoung Nobles that ought to have been as if she rather thought she had\r\nhad the pleasure of inspecting them before, but didn\'t quite know what\r\nto make of them.\r\n\r\n"Here! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby," said Flopson. "Don\'t\r\ntake it that way, or you\'ll get its head under the table."\r\n\r\nThus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head\r\nupon the table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious\r\nconcussion.\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear! Give it me back, Mum," said Flopson; "and Miss Jane, come\r\nand dance to baby, do!"\r\n\r\nOne of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely\r\ntaken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her place\r\nby me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and\r\nlaughed. Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket (who in the\r\nmeantime had twice endeavored to lift himself up by the hair) laughed,\r\nand we all laughed and were glad.\r\n\r\nFlopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll,\r\nthen got it safely into Mrs. Pocket\'s lap, and gave it the nut-crackers\r\nto play with; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice\r\nthat the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its\r\neyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same. Then, the\r\ntwo nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with\r\na dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly lost\r\nhalf his buttons at the gaming-table.\r\n\r\nI was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket\'s falling into a\r\ndiscussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a\r\nsliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the\r\nbaby on her lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers. At\r\nlength little Jane, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled, softly\r\nleft her place, and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous\r\nweapon away. Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the same time,\r\nand not approving of this, said to Jane,--\r\n\r\n"You naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!"\r\n\r\n"Mamma dear," lisped the little girl, "baby ood have put hith eyeth\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"How dare you tell me so?" retorted Mrs. Pocket. "Go and sit down in\r\nyour chair this moment!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Pocket\'s dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as if\r\nI myself had done something to rouse it.\r\n\r\n"Belinda," remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table,\r\n"how can you be so unreasonable? Jane only interfered for the protection\r\nof baby."\r\n\r\n"I will not allow anybody to interfere," said Mrs. Pocket. "I am\r\nsurprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of\r\ninterference."\r\n\r\n"Good God!" cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation.\r\n"Are infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs, and is nobody to save\r\nthem?"\r\n\r\n"I will not be interfered with by Jane," said Mrs. Pocket, with a\r\nmajestic glance at that innocent little offender. "I hope I know my poor\r\ngrandpapa\'s position. Jane, indeed!"\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really did\r\nlift himself some inches out of his chair. "Hear this!" he helplessly\r\nexclaimed to the elements. "Babies are to be nut-crackered dead, for\r\npeople\'s poor grandpapa\'s positions!" Then he let himself down again,\r\nand became silent.\r\n\r\nWe all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on. A\r\npause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a\r\nseries of leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be the\r\nonly member of the family (irrespective of servants) with whom it had\r\nany decided acquaintance.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Drummle," said Mrs. Pocket, "will you ring for Flopson? Jane, you\r\nundutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling, come with\r\nma!"\r\n\r\nThe baby was the soul of honor, and protested with all its might. It\r\ndoubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket\'s arm, exhibited a pair\r\nof knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft\r\nface, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny. And it gained\r\nits point after all, for I saw it through the window within a few\r\nminutes, being nursed by little Jane.\r\n\r\nIt happened that the other five children were left behind at the\r\ndinner-table, through Flopson\'s having some private engagement, and\r\ntheir not being anybody else\'s business. I thus became aware of the\r\nmutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in\r\nthe following manner. Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his face\r\nheightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes, as if\r\nhe couldn\'t make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that\r\nestablishment, and why they hadn\'t been billeted by Nature on\r\nsomebody else. Then, in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain\r\nquestions,--as why little Joe had that hole in his frill, who said, Pa,\r\nFlopson was going to mend it when she had time,--and how little Fanny\r\ncame by that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it\r\nwhen she didn\'t forget. Then, he melted into parental tenderness, and\r\ngave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then as\r\nthey went out, with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the\r\nhair he dismissed the hopeless subject.\r\n\r\nIn the evening there was rowing on the river. As Drummle and Startop had\r\neach a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. I was\r\npretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts, but as\r\nI was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,--not to say\r\nfor other waters,--I at once engaged to place myself under the tuition\r\nof the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs, and to whom I\r\nwas introduced by my new allies. This practical authority confused me\r\nvery much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith. If he could have\r\nknown how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil, I doubt if he would\r\nhave paid it.\r\n\r\nThere was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think we\r\nshould all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable\r\ndomestic occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid\r\ncame in, and said, "If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you."\r\n\r\n"Speak to your master?" said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was roused\r\nagain. "How can you think of such a thing? Go and speak to Flopson. Or\r\nspeak to me--at some other time."\r\n\r\n"Begging your pardon, ma\'am," returned the housemaid, "I should wish to\r\nspeak at once, and to speak to master."\r\n\r\nHereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best of\r\nourselves until he came back.\r\n\r\n"This is a pretty thing, Belinda!" said Mr. Pocket, returning with a\r\ncountenance expressive of grief and despair. "Here\'s the cook lying\r\ninsensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of fresh\r\nbutter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, "This is\r\nthat odious Sophia\'s doing!"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Belinda?" demanded Mr. Pocket.\r\n\r\n"Sophia has told you," said Mrs. Pocket. "Did I not see her with my own\r\neyes and hear her with my own ears, come into the room just now and ask\r\nto speak to you?"\r\n\r\n"But has she not taken me downstairs, Belinda," returned Mr. Pocket,\r\n"and shown me the woman, and the bundle too?"\r\n\r\n"And do you defend her, Matthew," said Mrs. Pocket, "for making\r\nmischief?"\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan.\r\n\r\n"Am I, grandpapa\'s granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?" said Mrs.\r\nPocket. "Besides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman,\r\nand said in the most natural manner when she came to look after the\r\nsituation, that she felt I was born to be a Duchess."\r\n\r\nThere was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he dropped upon it in the\r\nattitude of the Dying Gladiator. Still in that attitude he said, with a\r\nhollow voice, "Good night, Mr. Pip," when I deemed it advisable to go to\r\nbed and leave him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV\r\n\r\nAfter two or three days, when I had established myself in my room and\r\nhad gone backwards and forwards to London several times, and had ordered\r\nall I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk together.\r\nHe knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for he referred\r\nto his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed for any\r\nprofession, and that I should be well enough educated for my destiny\r\nif I could "hold my own" with the average of young men in prosperous\r\ncircumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to the contrary.\r\n\r\nHe advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition of\r\nsuch mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with the functions\r\nof explainer and director of all my studies. He hoped that with\r\nintelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me, and\r\nshould soon be able to dispense with any aid but his. Through his way\r\nof saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himself on\r\nconfidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state\r\nat once that he was always so zealous and honorable in fulfilling his\r\ncompact with me, that he made me zealous and honorable in fulfilling\r\nmine with him. If he had shown indifference as a master, I have no doubt\r\nI should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me no such\r\nexcuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor did I ever regard\r\nhim as having anything ludicrous about him--or anything but what was\r\nserious, honest, and good--in his tutor communication with me.\r\n\r\nWhen these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had\r\nbegun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my\r\nbedroom in Barnard\'s Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my\r\nmanners would be none the worse for Herbert\'s society. Mr. Pocket did\r\nnot object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could\r\npossibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt\r\nthat this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would\r\nsave Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and imparted\r\nmy wish to Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n"If I could buy the furniture now hired for me," said I, "and one or two\r\nother little things, I should be quite at home there."\r\n\r\n"Go it!" said Mr. Jaggers, with a short laugh. "I told you you\'d get on.\r\nWell! How much do you want?"\r\n\r\nI said I didn\'t know how much.\r\n\r\n"Come!" retorted Mr. Jaggers. "How much? Fifty pounds?"\r\n\r\n"O, not nearly so much."\r\n\r\n"Five pounds?" said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\nThis was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, "O, more than\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"More than that, eh!" retorted Mr. Jaggers, lying in wait for me, with\r\nhis hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on the wall\r\nbehind me; "how much more?"\r\n\r\n"It is so difficult to fix a sum," said I, hesitating.\r\n\r\n"Come!" said Mr. Jaggers. "Let\'s get at it. Twice five; will that do?\r\nThree times five; will that do? Four times five; will that do?"\r\n\r\nI said I thought that would do handsomely.\r\n\r\n"Four times five will do handsomely, will it?" said Mr. Jaggers,\r\nknitting his brows. "Now, what do you make of four times five?"\r\n\r\n"What do I make of it?"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Mr. Jaggers; "how much?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose you make it twenty pounds," said I, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Never mind what I make it, my friend," observed Mr. Jaggers, with a\r\nknowing and contradictory toss of his head. "I want to know what you\r\nmake it."\r\n\r\n"Twenty pounds, of course."\r\n\r\n"Wemmick!" said Mr. Jaggers, opening his office door. "Take Mr. Pip\'s\r\nwritten order, and pay him twenty pounds."\r\n\r\nThis strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked\r\nimpression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind. Mr. Jaggers never\r\nlaughed; but he wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poising\r\nhimself on these boots, with his large head bent down and his eyebrows\r\njoined together, awaiting an answer, he sometimes caused the boots to\r\ncreak, as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way. As he happened\r\nto go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said to Wemmick\r\nthat I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers\'s manner.\r\n\r\n"Tell him that, and he\'ll take it as a compliment," answered Wemmick;\r\n"he don\'t mean that you should know what to make of it.--Oh!" for\r\nI looked surprised, "it\'s not personal; it\'s professional: only\r\nprofessional."\r\n\r\nWemmick was at his desk, lunching--and crunching--on a dry hard biscuit;\r\npieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth, as\r\nif he were posting them.\r\n\r\n"Always seems to me," said Wemmick, "as if he had set a man-trap and was\r\nwatching it. Suddenly-click--you\'re caught!"\r\n\r\nWithout remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities of life, I\r\nsaid I supposed he was very skilful?\r\n\r\n"Deep," said Wemmick, "as Australia." Pointing with his pen at the\r\noffice floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the purposes\r\nof the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe.\r\n"If there was anything deeper," added Wemmick, bringing his pen to\r\npaper, "he\'d be it."\r\n\r\nThen, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick said,\r\n"Ca-pi-tal!" Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which he\r\nreplied,--\r\n\r\n"We don\'t run much into clerks, because there\'s only one Jaggers, and\r\npeople won\'t have him at second hand. There are only four of us. Would\r\nyou like to see \'em? You are one of us, as I may say."\r\n\r\nI accepted the offer. When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the\r\npost, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key\r\nof which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his\r\ncoat-collar like an iron-pigtail, we went upstairs. The house was dark\r\nand shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr.\r\nJaggers\'s room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase\r\nfor years. In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something\r\nbetween a publican and a rat-catcher--a large pale, puffed, swollen\r\nman--was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby\r\nappearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to\r\nbe treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers\'s coffers. "Getting evidence\r\ntogether," said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, "for the Bailey." In the\r\nroom over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair\r\n(his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) was\r\nsimilarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented\r\nto me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would melt\r\nme anything I pleased,--and who was in an excessive white-perspiration,\r\nas if he had been trying his art on himself. In a back room, a\r\nhigh-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was\r\ndressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been\r\nwaxed, was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of\r\nthe other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers\'s own use.\r\n\r\nThis was all the establishment. When we went downstairs again, Wemmick\r\nled me into my guardian\'s room, and said, "This you\'ve seen already."\r\n\r\n"Pray," said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them\r\ncaught my sight again, "whose likenesses are those?"\r\n\r\n"These?" said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust off\r\nthe horrible heads before bringing them down. "These are two celebrated\r\nones. Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit. This chap\r\n(why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the\r\ninkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!) murdered\r\nhis master, and, considering that he wasn\'t brought up to evidence,\r\ndidn\'t plan it badly."\r\n\r\n"Is it like him?" I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat\r\nupon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve.\r\n\r\n"Like him? It\'s himself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate,\r\ndirectly after he was taken down. You had a particular fancy for\r\nme, hadn\'t you, Old Artful?" said Wemmick. He then explained this\r\naffectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the lady\r\nand the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying,\r\n"Had it made for me, express!"\r\n\r\n"Is the lady anybody?" said I.\r\n\r\n"No," returned Wemmick. "Only his game. (You liked your bit of game,\r\ndidn\'t you?) No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except\r\none,--and she wasn\'t of this slender lady-like sort, and you wouldn\'t\r\nhave caught her looking after this urn, unless there was something to\r\ndrink in it." Wemmick\'s attention being thus directed to his brooch, he\r\nput down the cast, and polished the brooch with his pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n"Did that other creature come to the same end?" I asked. "He has the\r\nsame look."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right," said Wemmick; "it\'s the genuine look. Much as if one\r\nnostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook. Yes,\r\nhe came to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you.\r\nHe forged wills, this blade did, if he didn\'t also put the supposed\r\ntestators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, though" (Mr.\r\nWemmick was again apostrophizing), "and you said you could write Greek.\r\nYah, Bounceable! What a liar you were! I never met such a liar as you!"\r\nBefore putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched the\r\nlargest of his mourning rings and said, "Sent out to buy it for me, only\r\nthe day before."\r\n\r\nWhile he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair,\r\nthe thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived\r\nfrom like sources. As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, I\r\nventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stood before\r\nme, dusting his hands.\r\n\r\n"O yes," he returned, "these are all gifts of that kind. One brings\r\nanother, you see; that\'s the way of it. I always take \'em. They\'re\r\ncuriosities. And they\'re property. They may not be worth much, but,\r\nafter all, they\'re property and portable. It don\'t signify to you with\r\nyour brilliant lookout, but as to myself, my guiding-star always is,\r\n\'Get hold of portable property\'."\r\n\r\nWhen I had rendered homage to this light, he went on to say, in a\r\nfriendly manner:--\r\n\r\n"If at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldn\'t\r\nmind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and I\r\nshould consider it an honor. I have not much to show you; but such two\r\nor three curiosities as I have got you might like to look over; and I am\r\nfond of a bit of garden and a summer-house."\r\n\r\nI said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality.\r\n\r\n"Thankee," said he; "then we\'ll consider that it\'s to come off, when\r\nconvenient to you. Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?"\r\n\r\n"Not yet."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Wemmick, "he\'ll give you wine, and good wine. I\'ll give you\r\npunch, and not bad punch. And now I\'ll tell you something. When you go\r\nto dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his housekeeper."\r\n\r\n"Shall I see something very uncommon?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Wemmick, "you\'ll see a wild beast tamed. Not so very\r\nuncommon, you\'ll tell me. I reply, that depends on the original wildness\r\nof the beast, and the amount of taming. It won\'t lower your opinion of\r\nMr. Jaggers\'s powers. Keep your eye on it."\r\n\r\nI told him I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that his\r\npreparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, he asked me if I\r\nwould like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers "at it?"\r\n\r\nFor several reasons, and not least because I didn\'t clearly know what\r\nMr. Jaggers would be found to be "at," I replied in the affirmative.\r\nWe dived into the City, and came up in a crowded police-court, where\r\na blood-relation (in the murderous sense) of the deceased, with the\r\nfanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortably\r\nchewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination or\r\ncross-examination,--I don\'t know which,--and was striking her, and\r\nthe bench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoever\r\ndegree, said a word that he didn\'t approve of, he instantly required to\r\nhave it "taken down." If anybody wouldn\'t make an admission, he said,\r\n"I\'ll have it out of you!" and if anybody made an admission, he said,\r\n"Now I have got you!" The magistrates shivered under a single bite of\r\nhis finger. Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his words,\r\nand shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction. Which\r\nside he was on I couldn\'t make out, for he seemed to me to be grinding\r\nthe whole place in a mill; I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe,\r\nhe was not on the side of the bench; for, he was making the legs of the\r\nold gentleman who presided, quite convulsive under the table, by his\r\ndenunciations of his conduct as the representative of British law and\r\njustice in that chair that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXV\r\n\r\nBentley Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book\r\nas if its writer had done him an injury, did not take up an\r\nacquaintance in a more agreeable spirit. Heavy in figure, movement,\r\nand comprehension,--in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in\r\nthe large, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as\r\nhe himself lolled about in a room,--he was idle, proud, niggardly,\r\nreserved, and suspicious. He came of rich people down in Somersetshire,\r\nwho had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the\r\ndiscovery that it was just of age and a blockhead. Thus, Bentley Drummle\r\nhad come to Mr. Pocket when he was a head taller than that gentleman,\r\nand half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen.\r\n\r\nStartop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he\r\nought to have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to her, and\r\nadmired her beyond measure. He had a woman\'s delicacy of feature,\r\nand was--"as you may see, though you never saw her," said Herbert to\r\nme--"exactly like his mother." It was but natural that I should take to\r\nhim much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliest\r\nevenings of our boating, he and I should pull homeward abreast of one\r\nanother, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley Drummle came up\r\nin our wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes. He\r\nwould always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature,\r\neven when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way; and I always\r\nthink of him as coming after us in the dark or by the back-water,\r\nwhen our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in\r\nmid-stream.\r\n\r\nHerbert was my intimate companion and friend. I presented him with a\r\nhalf-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his often coming down\r\nto Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in his chambers often\r\ntook me up to London. We used to walk between the two places at all\r\nhours. I have an affection for the road yet (though it is not so\r\npleasant a road as it was then), formed in the impressibility of untried\r\nyouth and hope.\r\n\r\nWhen I had been in Mr. Pocket\'s family a month or two, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nCamilla turned up. Camilla was Mr. Pocket\'s sister. Georgiana, whom I\r\nhad seen at Miss Havisham\'s on the same occasion, also turned up. She\r\nwas a cousin,--an indigestive single woman, who called her rigidity\r\nreligion, and her liver love. These people hated me with the hatred of\r\ncupidity and disappointment. As a matter of course, they fawned upon\r\nme in my prosperity with the basest meanness. Towards Mr. Pocket, as\r\na grown-up infant with no notion of his own interests, they showed the\r\ncomplacent forbearance I had heard them express. Mrs. Pocket they\r\nheld in contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily\r\ndisappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThese were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied\r\nmyself to my education. I soon contracted expensive habits, and began\r\nto spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should have\r\nthought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to my books.\r\nThere was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to feel\r\nmy deficiencies. Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast; and, with\r\none or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I wanted, and\r\nclear obstructions out of my road, I must have been as great a dolt as\r\nDrummle if I had done less.\r\n\r\nI had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write\r\nhim a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening. He\r\nreplied that it would give him much pleasure, and that he would expect\r\nme at the office at six o\'clock. Thither I went, and there I found him,\r\nputting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck.\r\n\r\n"Did you think of walking down to Walworth?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said I, "if you approve."\r\n\r\n"Very much," was Wemmick\'s reply, "for I have had my legs under the desk\r\nall day, and shall be glad to stretch them. Now, I\'ll tell you what I\r\nhave got for supper, Mr. Pip. I have got a stewed steak,--which is\r\nof home preparation,--and a cold roast fowl,--which is from the\r\ncook\'s-shop. I think it\'s tender, because the master of the shop was a\r\nJuryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him down easy.\r\nI reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, "Pick us out\r\na good one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box\r\nanother day or two, we could easily have done it." He said to that,\r\n"Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop." I let him, of\r\ncourse. As far as it goes, it\'s property and portable. You don\'t object\r\nto an aged parent, I hope?"\r\n\r\nI really thought he was still speaking of the fowl, until he added,\r\n"Because I have got an aged parent at my place." I then said what\r\npoliteness required.\r\n\r\n"So, you haven\'t dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?" he pursued, as we walked\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n"Not yet."\r\n\r\n"He told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming. I expect\r\nyou\'ll have an invitation to-morrow. He\'s going to ask your pals, too.\r\nThree of \'em; ain\'t there?"\r\n\r\nAlthough I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my\r\nintimate associates, I answered, "Yes."\r\n\r\n"Well, he\'s going to ask the whole gang,"--I hardly felt complimented by\r\nthe word,--"and whatever he gives you, he\'ll give you good. Don\'t look\r\nforward to variety, but you\'ll have excellence. And there\'s another rum\r\nthing in his house," proceeded Wemmick, after a moment\'s pause, as if\r\nthe remark followed on the housekeeper understood; "he never lets a door\r\nor window be fastened at night."\r\n\r\n"Is he never robbed?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s it!" returned Wemmick. "He says, and gives it out publicly, "I\r\nwant to see the man who\'ll rob me." Lord bless you, I have heard him, a\r\nhundred times, if I have heard him once, say to regular cracksmen in our\r\nfront office, "You know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawn there;\r\nwhy don\'t you do a stroke of business with me? Come; can\'t I tempt you?"\r\nNot a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on, for love or\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\n"They dread him so much?" said I.\r\n\r\n"Dread him," said Wemmick. "I believe you they dread him. Not but what\r\nhe\'s artful, even in his defiance of them. No silver, sir. Britannia\r\nmetal, every spoon."\r\n\r\n"So they wouldn\'t have much," I observed, "even if they--"\r\n\r\n"Ah! But he would have much," said Wemmick, cutting me short, "and they\r\nknow it. He\'d have their lives, and the lives of scores of \'em. He\'d\r\nhave all he could get. And it\'s impossible to say what he couldn\'t get,\r\nif he gave his mind to it."\r\n\r\nI was falling into meditation on my guardian\'s greatness, when Wemmick\r\nremarked:--\r\n\r\n"As to the absence of plate, that\'s only his natural depth, you know.\r\nA river\'s its natural depth, and he\'s his natural depth. Look at his\r\nwatch-chain. That\'s real enough."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very massive," said I.\r\n\r\n"Massive?" repeated Wemmick. "I think so. And his watch is a gold\r\nrepeater, and worth a hundred pound if it\'s worth a penny. Mr. Pip,\r\nthere are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about\r\nthat watch; there\'s not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who\r\nwouldn\'t identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it\r\nwas red hot, if inveigled into touching it."\r\n\r\nAt first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a more\r\ngeneral nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road,\r\nuntil he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of\r\nWalworth.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and little\r\ngardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement.\r\nWemmick\'s house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of\r\ngarden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted\r\nwith guns.\r\n\r\n"My own doing," said Wemmick. "Looks pretty; don\'t it?"\r\n\r\nI highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw;\r\nwith the queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of them sham),\r\nand a gothic door almost too small to get in at.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a real flagstaff, you see," said Wemmick, "and on Sundays I\r\nrun up a real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, I\r\nhoist it up--so--and cut off the communication."\r\n\r\nThe bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide\r\nand two deep. But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he\r\nhoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he did so, with a relish and\r\nnot merely mechanically.\r\n\r\n"At nine o\'clock every night, Greenwich time," said Wemmick, "the gun\r\nfires. There he is, you see! And when you hear him go, I think you\'ll\r\nsay he\'s a Stinger."\r\n\r\nThe piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress,\r\nconstructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by an\r\ningenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.\r\n\r\n"Then, at the back," said Wemmick, "out of sight, so as not to impede\r\nthe idea of fortifications,--for it\'s a principle with me, if you have\r\nan idea, carry it out and keep it up,--I don\'t know whether that\'s your\r\nopinion--"\r\n\r\nI said, decidedly.\r\n\r\n"--At the back, there\'s a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then,\r\nI knock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and\r\nyou\'ll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise. So, sir," said\r\nWemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head, "if you\r\ncan suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of a\r\ntime in point of provisions."\r\n\r\nThen, he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which was\r\napproached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long\r\ntime to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth.\r\nOur punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bower\r\nwas raised. This piece of water (with an island in the middle which\r\nmight have been the salad for supper) was of a circular form, and he had\r\nconstructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little mill going\r\nand took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extent that it\r\nmade the back of your hand quite wet.\r\n\r\n"I am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and\r\nmy own gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades," said Wemmick, in\r\nacknowledging my compliments. "Well; it\'s a good thing, you know. It\r\nbrushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged. You wouldn\'t\r\nmind being at once introduced to the Aged, would you? It wouldn\'t put\r\nyou out?"\r\n\r\nI expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle. There\r\nwe found, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat: clean,\r\ncheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.\r\n\r\n"Well aged parent," said Wemmick, shaking hands with him in a cordial\r\nand jocose way, "how am you?"\r\n\r\n"All right, John; all right!" replied the old man.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s Mr. Pip, aged parent," said Wemmick, "and I wish you could hear\r\nhis name. Nod away at him, Mr. Pip; that\'s what he likes. Nod away at\r\nhim, if you please, like winking!"\r\n\r\n"This is a fine place of my son\'s, sir," cried the old man, while I\r\nnodded as hard as I possibly could. "This is a pretty pleasure-ground,\r\nsir. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept\r\ntogether by the Nation, after my son\'s time, for the people\'s\r\nenjoyment."\r\n\r\n"You\'re as proud of it as Punch; ain\'t you, Aged?" said Wemmick,\r\ncontemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened; "there\'s\r\na nod for you;" giving him a tremendous one; "there\'s another for you;"\r\ngiving him a still more tremendous one; "you like that, don\'t you? If\r\nyou\'re not tired, Mr. Pip--though I know it\'s tiring to strangers--will\r\nyou tip him one more? You can\'t think how it pleases him."\r\n\r\nI tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits. We left him\r\nbestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in\r\nthe arbor; where Wemmick told me, as he smoked a pipe, that it had taken\r\nhim a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\n"Is it your own, Mr. Wemmick?"\r\n\r\n"O yes," said Wemmick, "I have got hold of it, a bit at a time. It\'s a\r\nfreehold, by George!"\r\n\r\n"Is it indeed? I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?"\r\n\r\n"Never seen it," said Wemmick. "Never heard of it. Never seen the Aged.\r\nNever heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and private life is\r\nanother. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and\r\nwhen I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it\'s not\r\nin any way disagreeable to you, you\'ll oblige me by doing the same. I\r\ndon\'t wish it professionally spoken about."\r\n\r\nOf course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his\r\nrequest. The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and\r\ntalking, until it was almost nine o\'clock. "Getting near gun-fire," said\r\nWemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; "it\'s the Aged\'s treat."\r\n\r\nProceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker,\r\nwith expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great\r\nnightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the\r\nmoment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and\r\nrepair to the battery. He took it, and went out, and presently the\r\nStinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a\r\ncottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup in\r\nit ring. Upon this, the Aged--who I believe would have been blown out\r\nof his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows--cried out exultingly,\r\n"He\'s fired! I heerd him!" and I nodded at the old gentleman until it is\r\nno figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.\r\n\r\nThe interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing\r\nme his collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a felonious\r\ncharacter; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been\r\ncommitted, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and several\r\nmanuscript confessions written under condemnation,--upon which Mr.\r\nWemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, "every one\r\nof \'em Lies, sir." These were agreeably dispersed among small specimens\r\nof china and glass, various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the\r\nmuseum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged. They were all\r\ndisplayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had been first\r\ninducted, and which served, not only as the general sitting-room but\r\nas the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob, and\r\na brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a\r\nroasting-jack.\r\n\r\nThere was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged in\r\nthe day. When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered to\r\ngive her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night. The supper was\r\nexcellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot insomuch\r\nthat it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have been\r\nfarther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment. Nor was\r\nthere any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there being such\r\na very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when I lay down\r\non my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that pole on my\r\nforehead all night.\r\n\r\nWemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him\r\ncleaning my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him from\r\nmy gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in\r\na most devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at\r\nhalf-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees,\r\nWemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened\r\ninto a post-office again. At last, when we got to his place of business\r\nand he pulled out his key from his coat-collar, he looked as unconscious\r\nof his Walworth property as if the Castle and the drawbridge and the\r\narbor and the lake and the fountain and the Aged, had all been blown\r\ninto space together by the last discharge of the Stinger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVI\r\n\r\nIt fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early\r\nopportunity of comparing my guardian\'s establishment with that of his\r\ncashier and clerk. My guardian was in his room, washing his hands with\r\nhis scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he\r\ncalled me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friends\r\nwhich Wemmick had prepared me to receive. "No ceremony," he stipulated,\r\n"and no dinner dress, and say to-morrow." I asked him where we should\r\ncome to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in his\r\ngeneral objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,\r\n"Come here, and I\'ll take you home with me." I embrace this opportunity\r\nof remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or\r\na dentist. He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose, which\r\nsmelt of the scented soap like a perfumer\'s shop. It had an unusually\r\nlarge jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would wash his\r\nhands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel, whenever he came\r\nin from a police court or dismissed a client from his room. When I and\r\nmy friends repaired to him at six o\'clock next day, he seemed to have\r\nbeen engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual, for we found\r\nhim with his head butted into this closet, not only washing his hands,\r\nbut laving his face and gargling his throat. And even when he had\r\ndone all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel, he took out his\r\npenknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat\r\non.\r\n\r\nThere were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into\r\nthe street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there was\r\nsomething so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled\r\nhis presence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked along\r\nwestward, he was recognized ever and again by some face in the crowd of\r\nthe streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but\r\nhe never otherwise recognized anybody, or took notice that anybody\r\nrecognized him.\r\n\r\nHe conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side of\r\nthat street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in want\r\nof painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and opened the\r\ndoor, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and little used.\r\nSo, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on\r\nthe first floor. There were carved garlands on the panelled walls, and\r\nas he stood among them giving us welcome, I know what kind of loops I\r\nthought they looked like.\r\n\r\nDinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his\r\ndressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the whole\r\nhouse, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was comfortably\r\nlaid--no silver in the service, of course--and at the side of his chair\r\nwas a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and decanters on\r\nit, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed throughout, that he\r\nkept everything under his own hand, and distributed everything himself.\r\n\r\nThere was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,\r\nthat they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography, trials,\r\nacts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very solid\r\nand good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however, and\r\nthere was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a little\r\ntable of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring the\r\noffice home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an\r\nevening and fall to work.\r\n\r\nAs he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,--for he and I had\r\nwalked together,--he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,\r\nand took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to\r\nbe principally if not solely interested in Drummle.\r\n\r\n"Pip," said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to\r\nthe window, "I don\'t know one from the other. Who\'s the Spider?"\r\n\r\n"The spider?" said I.\r\n\r\n"The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow."\r\n\r\n"That\'s Bentley Drummle," I replied; "the one with the delicate face is\r\nStartop."\r\n\r\nNot making the least account of "the one with the delicate face," he\r\nreturned, "Bentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of that\r\nfellow."\r\n\r\nHe immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his\r\nreplying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to screw\r\ndiscourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there came between\r\nme and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.\r\n\r\nShe was a woman of about forty, I supposed,--but I may have thought her\r\nyounger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely\r\npale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot\r\nsay whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be\r\nparted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious expression\r\nof suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see Macbeth at\r\nthe theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked to me as if\r\nit were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had seen rise out\r\nof the Witches\' caldron.\r\n\r\nShe set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a\r\nfinger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats\r\nat the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,\r\nwhile Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the\r\nhousekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice\r\nmutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all\r\nthe accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our\r\nhost from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the\r\ntable, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean\r\nplates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just\r\ndisused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant\r\nthan the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw\r\nin her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made\r\na dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other\r\nnatural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass\r\nbehind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.\r\n\r\nInduced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her\r\nown striking appearance and by Wemmick\'s preparation, I observed\r\nthat whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my\r\nguardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put\r\nbefore him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and\r\nwanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I\r\nfancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and a\r\npurpose of always holding her in suspense.\r\n\r\nDinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather\r\nthan originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of\r\nour dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing my\r\ntendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronize Herbert, and to boast\r\nof my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my lips.\r\nIt was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the\r\ndevelopment of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious\r\nway at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.\r\n\r\nIt was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our\r\nconversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied\r\nfor coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.\r\nDrummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to\r\nour company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that\r\nas to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible agency,\r\nmy guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this\r\ntrifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular\r\nit was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nNow the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,\r\ntaking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,\r\nwas leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and\r\nshowing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.\r\nSuddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper\'s, like a trap,\r\nas she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do\r\nthis, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.\r\n\r\n"If you talk of strength," said Mr. Jaggers, "I\'ll show you a wrist.\r\nMolly, let them see your wrist."\r\n\r\nHer entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other\r\nhand behind her waist. "Master," she said, in a low voice, with her eyes\r\nattentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. "Don\'t."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll show you a wrist," repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable\r\ndetermination to show it. "Molly, let them see your wrist."\r\n\r\n"Master," she again murmured. "Please!"\r\n\r\n"Molly," said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking\r\nat the opposite side of the room, "let them see both your wrists. Show\r\nthem. Come!"\r\n\r\nHe took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She\r\nbrought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by\r\nside. The last wrist was much disfigured,--deeply scarred and scarred\r\nacross and across. When she held her hands out she took her eyes from\r\nMr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us\r\nin succession.\r\n\r\n"There\'s power here," said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews\r\nwith his forefinger. "Very few men have the power of wrist that this\r\nwoman has. It\'s remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these\r\nhands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw\r\nstronger in that respect, man\'s or woman\'s, than these."\r\n\r\nWhile he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she continued\r\nto look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment\r\nhe ceased, she looked at him again. "That\'ll do, Molly," said Mr.\r\nJaggers, giving her a slight nod; "you have been admired, and can\r\ngo." She withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers,\r\nputting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter, filled his glass and\r\npassed round the wine.\r\n\r\n"At half-past nine, gentlemen," said he, "we must break up. Pray make\r\nthe best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, I\r\ndrink to you."\r\n\r\nIf his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more,\r\nit perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose\r\ndepreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree,\r\nuntil he became downright intolerable. Through all his stages, Mr.\r\nJaggers followed him with the same strange interest. He actually seemed\r\nto serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers\'s wine.\r\n\r\nIn our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink,\r\nand I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some\r\nboorish sneer of Drummle\'s, to the effect that we were too free with our\r\nmoney. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that it\r\ncame with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my\r\npresence but a week or so before.\r\n\r\n"Well," retorted Drummle; "he\'ll be paid."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to imply that he won\'t," said I, "but it might make you\r\nhold your tongue about us and our money, I should think."\r\n\r\n"You should think!" retorted Drummle. "Oh Lord!"\r\n\r\n"I dare say," I went on, meaning to be very severe, "that you wouldn\'t\r\nlend money to any of us if we wanted it."\r\n\r\n"You are right," said Drummle. "I wouldn\'t lend one of you a sixpence. I\r\nwouldn\'t lend anybody a sixpence."\r\n\r\n"Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say."\r\n\r\n"You should say," repeated Drummle. "Oh Lord!"\r\n\r\nThis was so very aggravating--the more especially as I found myself\r\nmaking no way against his surly obtuseness--that I said, disregarding\r\nHerbert\'s efforts to check me,--\r\n\r\n"Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I\'ll tell you what\r\npassed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,"\r\ngrowled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that we might\r\nboth go to the devil and shake ourselves.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you, however," said I, "whether you want to know or not. We\r\nsaid that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed\r\nto be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it."\r\n\r\nDrummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his hands\r\nin his pockets and his round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that\r\nit was quite true, and that he despised us as asses all.\r\n\r\nHereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than\r\nI had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop,\r\nbeing a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact\r\nopposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct\r\npersonal affront. He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop\r\ntried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made\r\nus all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything, Drummle,\r\nwithout any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his pockets,\r\ndropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and would\r\nhave flung it at his adversary\'s head, but for our entertainer\'s\r\ndexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and\r\nhauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, "I am exceedingly\r\nsorry to announce that it\'s half past nine."\r\n\r\nOn this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,\r\nStartop was cheerily calling Drummle "old boy," as if nothing had\r\nhappened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not\r\neven walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I,\r\nwho remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides;\r\nStartop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses,\r\nmuch as he was wont to follow in his boat.\r\n\r\nAs the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for\r\na moment, and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian. I found\r\nhim in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots, already hard\r\nat it, washing his hands of us.\r\n\r\nI told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything\r\ndisagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blame\r\nme much.\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through the\r\nwater-drops; "it\'s nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though."\r\n\r\nHe had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and blowing, and\r\ntowelling himself.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you like him, sir," said I--"but I don\'t."\r\n\r\n"No, no," my guardian assented; "don\'t have too much to do with him.\r\nKeep as clear of him as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip; he is one\r\nof the true sort. Why, if I was a fortune-teller--"\r\n\r\nLooking out of the towel, he caught my eye.\r\n\r\n"But I am not a fortune-teller," he said, letting his head drop into a\r\nfestoon of towel, and towelling away at his two ears. "You know what I\r\nam, don\'t you? Good night, Pip."\r\n\r\n"Good night, sir."\r\n\r\nIn about a month after that, the Spider\'s time with Mr. Pocket was up\r\nfor good, and, to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket, he\r\nwent home to the family hole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\n"MY DEAR MR PIP:--\r\n\r\n"I write this by request of Mr. Gargery, for to let you know that he\r\nis going to London in company with Mr. Wopsle and would be glad if\r\nagreeable to be allowed to see you. He would call at Barnard\'s Hotel\r\nTuesday morning at nine o\'clock, when if not agreeable please leave\r\nword. Your poor sister is much the same as when you left. We talk of you\r\nin the kitchen every night, and wonder what you are saying and doing. If\r\nnow considered in the light of a liberty, excuse it for the love of\r\npoor old days. No more, dear Mr. Pip, from your ever obliged, and\r\naffectionate servant,\r\n\r\n"BIDDY."\r\n\r\n"P.S. He wishes me most particular to write what larks. He says you will\r\nunderstand. I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him,\r\neven though a gentleman, for you had ever a good heart, and he is a\r\nworthy, worthy man. I have read him all, excepting only the last little\r\nsentence, and he wishes me most particular to write again what larks."\r\n\r\nI received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its\r\nappointment was for next day. Let me confess exactly with what feelings\r\nI looked forward to Joe\'s coming.\r\n\r\nNot with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many ties; no;\r\nwith considerable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of\r\nincongruity. If I could have kept him away by paying money, I certainly\r\nwould have paid money. My greatest reassurance was that he was coming\r\nto Barnard\'s Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall\r\nin Bentley Drummle\'s way. I had little objection to his being seen by\r\nHerbert or his father, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the\r\nsharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle, whom I held in\r\ncontempt. So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses are\r\nusually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.\r\n\r\nI had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite\r\nunnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those\r\nwrestles with Barnard proved to be. By this time, the rooms were\r\nvastly different from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the honor\r\nof occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighboring\r\nupholsterer. I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a boy\r\nin boots,--top boots,--in bondage and slavery to whom I might have been\r\nsaid to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster (out of the\r\nrefuse of my washerwoman\'s family), and had clothed him with a blue\r\ncoat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots\r\nalready mentioned, I had to find him a little to do and a great deal\r\nto eat; and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThis avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday\r\nmorning in the hall, (it was two feet square, as charged for\r\nfloorcloth,) and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he\r\nthought Joe would like. While I felt sincerely obliged to him for being\r\nso interested and considerate, I had an odd half-provoked sense of\r\nsuspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see him, he wouldn\'t\r\nhave been quite so brisk about it.\r\n\r\nHowever, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe, and\r\nI got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and\r\nbreakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance. Unfortunately\r\nthe morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the fact\r\nthat Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some weak\r\ngiant of a Sweep.\r\n\r\nAs the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avenger\r\npursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe on\r\nthe staircase. I knew it was Joe, by his clumsy manner of coming upstairs,\r\n--his state boots being always too big for him,--and by the time\r\nit took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of\r\nhis ascent. When at last he stopped outside our door, I could hear his\r\nfinger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I afterwards\r\ndistinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole. Finally he gave a\r\nfaint single rap, and Pepper--such was the compromising name of the\r\navenging boy--announced "Mr. Gargery!" I thought he never would have\r\ndone wiping his feet, and that I must have gone out to lift him off the\r\nmat, but at last he came in.\r\n\r\n"Joe, how are you, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"Pip, how AIR you, Pip?"\r\n\r\nWith his good honest face all glowing and shining, and his hat put\r\ndown on the floor between us, he caught both my hands and worked them\r\nstraight up and down, as if I had been the last-patented Pump.\r\n\r\n"I am glad to see you, Joe. Give me your hat."\r\n\r\nBut Joe, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a bird\'s-nest with\r\neggs in it, wouldn\'t hear of parting with that piece of property, and\r\npersisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way.\r\n\r\n"Which you have that growed," said Joe, "and that swelled, and that\r\ngentle-folked;" Joe considered a little before he discovered this word;\r\n"as to be sure you are a honor to your king and country."\r\n\r\n"And you, Joe, look wonderfully well."\r\n\r\n"Thank God," said Joe, "I\'m ekerval to most. And your sister, she\'s\r\nno worse than she were. And Biddy, she\'s ever right and ready. And all\r\nfriends is no backerder, if not no forarder. \'Ceptin Wopsle; he\'s had a\r\ndrop."\r\n\r\nAll this time (still with both hands taking great care of the\r\nbird\'s-nest), Joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room, and\r\nround and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown.\r\n\r\n"Had a drop, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"Why yes," said Joe, lowering his voice, "he\'s left the Church and went\r\ninto the playacting. Which the playacting have likeways brought him\r\nto London along with me. And his wish were," said Joe, getting the\r\nbird\'s-nest under his left arm for the moment, and groping in it for an\r\negg with his right; "if no offence, as I would \'and you that."\r\n\r\nI took what Joe gave me, and found it to be the crumpled play-bill of\r\na small metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in that\r\nvery week, of "the celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown,\r\nwhose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National Bard\r\nhas lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles."\r\n\r\n"Were you at his performance, Joe?" I inquired.\r\n\r\n"I were," said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity.\r\n\r\n"Was there a great sensation?"\r\n\r\n"Why," said Joe, "yes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel.\r\nPartickler when he see the ghost. Though I put it to yourself, sir,\r\nwhether it were calc\'lated to keep a man up to his work with a good\r\nhart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with\r\n"Amen!" A man may have had a misfortun\' and been in the Church," said\r\nJoe, lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone, "but\r\nthat is no reason why you should put him out at such a time. Which I\r\nmeantersay, if the ghost of a man\'s own father cannot be allowed to\r\nclaim his attention, what can, Sir? Still more, when his mourning \'at\r\nis unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers\r\nbrings it off, try to keep it on how you may."\r\n\r\nA ghost-seeing effect in Joe\'s own countenance informed me that Herbert\r\nhad entered the room. So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out his\r\nhand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the bird\'s-nest.\r\n\r\n"Your servant, Sir," said Joe, "which I hope as you and Pip"--here his\r\neye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and so\r\nplainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the\r\nfamily, that I frowned it down and confused him more--"I meantersay, you\r\ntwo gentlemen,--which I hope as you get your elths in this close spot?\r\nFor the present may be a werry good inn, according to London opinions,"\r\nsaid Joe, confidentially, "and I believe its character do stand it; but I\r\nwouldn\'t keep a pig in it myself,--not in the case that I wished him to\r\nfatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavor on him."\r\n\r\nHaving borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our\r\ndwelling-place, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me\r\n"sir," Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round the\r\nroom for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat,--as if it were\r\nonly on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a\r\nresting place,--and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the\r\nchimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.\r\n\r\n"Do you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?" asked Herbert, who always\r\npresided of a morning.\r\n\r\n"Thankee, Sir," said Joe, stiff from head to foot, "I\'ll take whichever\r\nis most agreeable to yourself."\r\n\r\n"What do you say to coffee?"\r\n\r\n"Thankee, Sir," returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal,\r\n"since you are so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run contrairy\r\nto your own opinions. But don\'t you never find it a little \'eating?"\r\n\r\n"Say tea then," said Herbert, pouring it out.\r\n\r\nHere Joe\'s hat tumbled off the mantel-piece, and he started out of his\r\nchair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot. As if it\r\nwere an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n"When did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?"\r\n\r\n"Were it yesterday afternoon?" said Joe, after coughing behind his hand,\r\nas if he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he came. "No\r\nit were not. Yes it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoon" (with an\r\nappearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality).\r\n\r\n"Have you seen anything of London yet?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, Sir," said Joe, "me and Wopsle went off straight to look at\r\nthe Blacking Ware\'us. But we didn\'t find that it come up to its likeness\r\nin the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay," added Joe, in\r\nan explanatory manner, "as it is there drawd too architectooralooral."\r\n\r\nI really believe Joe would have prolonged this word (mightily expressive\r\nto my mind of some architecture that I know) into a perfect Chorus, but\r\nfor his attention being providentially attracted by his hat, which\r\nwas toppling. Indeed, it demanded from him a constant attention, and a\r\nquickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted by wicket-keeping.\r\nHe made extraordinary play with it, and showed the greatest skill; now,\r\nrushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped; now, merely stopping\r\nit midway, beating it up, and humoring it in various parts of the room\r\nand against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall,\r\nbefore he felt it safe to close with it; finally splashing it into the\r\nslop-basin, where I took the liberty of laying hands upon it.\r\n\r\nAs to his shirt-collar, and his coat-collar, they were perplexing to\r\nreflect upon,--insoluble mysteries both. Why should a man scrape himself\r\nto that extent, before he could consider himself full dressed? Why\r\nshould he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for\r\nhis holiday clothes? Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of\r\nmeditation, with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth; had\r\nhis eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with such\r\nremarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much\r\nmore than he ate, and pretended that he hadn\'t dropped it; that I was\r\nheartily glad when Herbert left us for the City.\r\n\r\nI had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was\r\nall my fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would have\r\nbeen easier with me. I felt impatient of him and out of temper with him;\r\nin which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head.\r\n\r\n"Us two being now alone, sir,"--began Joe.\r\n\r\n"Joe," I interrupted, pettishly, "how can you call me, sir?"\r\n\r\nJoe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like\r\nreproach. Utterly preposterous as his cravat was, and as his collars\r\nwere, I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look.\r\n\r\n"Us two being now alone," resumed Joe, "and me having the intentions and\r\nabilities to stay not many minutes more, I will now conclude--leastways\r\nbegin--to mention what have led to my having had the present honor. For\r\nwas it not," said Joe, with his old air of lucid exposition, "that my\r\nonly wish were to be useful to you, I should not have had the honor of\r\nbreaking wittles in the company and abode of gentlemen."\r\n\r\nI was so unwilling to see the look again, that I made no remonstrance\r\nagainst this tone.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," pursued Joe, "this is how it were. I were at the Bargemen\r\nt\'other night, Pip;"--whenever he subsided into affection, he called me\r\nPip, and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me sir; "when\r\nthere come up in his shay-cart, Pumblechook. Which that same identical,"\r\nsaid Joe, going down a new track, "do comb my \'air the wrong way\r\nsometimes, awful, by giving out up and down town as it were him which\r\never had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a playfellow\r\nby yourself."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense. It was you, Joe."\r\n\r\n"Which I fully believed it were, Pip," said Joe, slightly tossing\r\nhis head, "though it signify little now, sir. Well, Pip; this same\r\nidentical, which his manners is given to blusterous, come to me at\r\nthe Bargemen (wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the\r\nworkingman, sir, and do not over stimilate), and his word were, \'Joseph,\r\nMiss Havisham she wish to speak to you.\'"\r\n\r\n"Miss Havisham, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"\'She wish,\' were Pumblechook\'s word, \'to speak to you.\'" Joe sat and\r\nrolled his eyes at the ceiling.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Joe? Go on, please."\r\n\r\n"Next day, sir," said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off,\r\n"having cleaned myself, I go and I see Miss A."\r\n\r\n"Miss A., Joe? Miss Havisham?"\r\n\r\n"Which I say, sir," replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as if\r\nhe were making his will, "Miss A., or otherways Havisham. Her expression\r\nair then as follering: \'Mr. Gargery. You air in correspondence with Mr.\r\nPip?\' Having had a letter from you, I were able to say \'I am.\' (When\r\nI married your sister, sir, I said \'I will;\' and when I answered your\r\nfriend, Pip, I said \'I am.\') \'Would you tell him, then,\' said she, \'that\r\nwhich Estella has come home and would be glad to see him.\'"\r\n\r\nI felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe. I hope one remote cause\r\nof its firing may have been my consciousness that if I had known his\r\nerrand, I should have given him more encouragement.\r\n\r\n"Biddy," pursued Joe, "when I got home and asked her fur to write the\r\nmessage to you, a little hung back. Biddy says, \'I know he will be very\r\nglad to have it by word of mouth, it is holiday time, you want to see\r\nhim, go!\' I have now concluded, sir," said Joe, rising from his chair,\r\n"and, Pip, I wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a\r\ngreater height."\r\n\r\n"But you are not going now, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"Yes I am," said Joe.\r\n\r\n"But you are coming back to dinner, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"No I am not," said Joe.\r\n\r\nOur eyes met, and all the "Sir" melted out of that manly heart as he gave\r\nme his hand.\r\n\r\n"Pip, dear old chap, life is made of ever so many partings welded\r\ntogether, as I may say, and one man\'s a blacksmith, and one\'s a\r\nwhitesmith, and one\'s a goldsmith, and one\'s a coppersmith. Diwisions\r\namong such must come, and must be met as they come. If there\'s been\r\nany fault at all to-day, it\'s mine. You and me is not two figures to\r\nbe together in London; nor yet anywheres else but what is private, and\r\nbeknown, and understood among friends. It ain\'t that I am proud, but\r\nthat I want to be right, as you shall never see me no more in these\r\nclothes. I\'m wrong in these clothes. I\'m wrong out of the forge, the\r\nkitchen, or off th\' meshes. You won\'t find half so much fault in me if\r\nyou think of me in my forge dress, with my hammer in my hand, or even\r\nmy pipe. You won\'t find half so much fault in me if, supposing as you\r\nshould ever wish to see me, you come and put your head in at the forge\r\nwindow and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at the old anvil, in the old\r\nburnt apron, sticking to the old work. I\'m awful dull, but I hope I\'ve\r\nbeat out something nigh the rights of this at last. And so GOD bless\r\nyou, dear old Pip, old chap, GOD bless you!"\r\n\r\nI had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity\r\nin him. The fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he\r\nspoke these words than it could come in its way in Heaven. He touched me\r\ngently on the forehead, and went out. As soon as I could recover\r\nmyself sufficiently, I hurried out after him and looked for him in the\r\nneighboring streets; but he was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVIII\r\n\r\nIt was clear that I must repair to our town next day, and in the first\r\nflow of my repentance, it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe\'s.\r\nBut, when I had secured my box-place by to-morrow\'s coach, and had been\r\ndown to Mr. Pocket\'s and back, I was not by any means convinced on the\r\nlast point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting\r\nup at the Blue Boar. I should be an inconvenience at Joe\'s; I was not\r\nexpected, and my bed would not be ready; I should be too far from\r\nMiss Havisham\'s, and she was exacting and mightn\'t like it. All other\r\nswindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers, and with such\r\npretences did I cheat myself. Surely a curious thing. That I should\r\ninnocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else\'s manufacture is\r\nreasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin\r\nof my own make as good money! An obliging stranger, under pretence of\r\ncompactly folding up my bank-notes for security\'s sake, abstracts the\r\nnotes and gives me nutshells; but what is his sleight of hand to mine,\r\nwhen I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!\r\n\r\nHaving settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was much\r\ndisturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger. It was\r\ntempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots\r\nin the archway of the Blue Boar\'s posting-yard; it was almost solemn to\r\nimagine him casually produced in the tailor\'s shop, and confounding\r\nthe disrespectful senses of Trabb\'s boy. On the other hand, Trabb\'s boy\r\nmight worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things; or, reckless\r\nand desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might hoot him in the High\r\nStreet. My patroness, too, might hear of him, and not approve. On the\r\nwhole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.\r\n\r\nIt was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as winter\r\nhad now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until two or\r\nthree hours after dark. Our time of starting from the Cross Keys was\r\ntwo o\'clock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare,\r\nattended by the Avenger,--if I may connect that expression with one who\r\nnever attended on me if he could possibly help it.\r\n\r\nAt that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards\r\nby stage-coach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside\r\npassengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling\r\ntheir ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised\r\nwhen Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were two\r\nconvicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an old reason\r\nnow for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word "convict."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mind them, Handel?" said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"O no!"\r\n\r\n"I thought you seemed as if you didn\'t like them?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don\'t\r\nparticularly. But I don\'t mind them."\r\n\r\n"See! There they are," said Herbert, "coming out of the Tap. What a\r\ndegraded and vile sight it is!"\r\n\r\nThey had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler\r\nwith them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.\r\nThe two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their\r\nlegs,--irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I\r\nlikewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried\r\na thick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good\r\nunderstanding with them, and stood with them beside him, looking on at\r\nthe putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts were\r\nan interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he the\r\nCurator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and appeared\r\nas a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the world,\r\nboth convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of\r\nclothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes,\r\nand his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his half-closed eye\r\nat one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen on the settle at the\r\nThree Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had brought me down\r\nwith his invisible gun!\r\n\r\nIt was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had\r\nnever seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eye appraised\r\nmy watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and said something to the\r\nother convict, and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink\r\nof their coupling manacle, and looked at something else. The great\r\nnumbers on their backs, as if they were street doors; their coarse mangy\r\nungainly outer surface, as if they were lower animals; their ironed\r\nlegs, apologetically garlanded with pocket-handkerchiefs; and the way\r\nin which all present looked at them and kept from them; made them (as\r\nHerbert had said) a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of the back\r\nof the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and that\r\nthere were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front\r\nbehind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had taken the\r\nfourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion, and said\r\nthat it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous\r\ncompany, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and infamous, and\r\nshameful, and I don\'t know what else. At this time the coach was ready\r\nand the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing to get up, and\r\nthe prisoners had come over with their keeper,--bringing with them that\r\ncurious flavor of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and hearthstone,\r\nwhich attends the convict presence.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t take it so much amiss, sir," pleaded the keeper to the angry\r\npassenger; "I\'ll sit next you myself. I\'ll put \'em on the outside of\r\nthe row. They won\'t interfere with you, sir. You needn\'t know they\'re\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"And don\'t blame me," growled the convict I had recognized. "I don\'t\r\nwant to go. I am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am concerned\r\nany one\'s welcome to my place."\r\n\r\n"Or mine," said the other, gruffly. "I wouldn\'t have incommoded none\r\nof you, if I\'d had my way." Then they both laughed, and began cracking\r\nnuts, and spitting the shells about.--As I really think I should have\r\nliked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so despised.\r\n\r\nAt length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman,\r\nand that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind. So he\r\ngot into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into the\r\nplace next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they\r\ncould, and the convict I had recognized sat behind me with his breath on\r\nthe hair of my head.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Handel!" Herbert called out as we started. I thought what a\r\nblessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict\'s\r\nbreathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The\r\nsensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and\r\nsearching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. He seemed to have more\r\nbreathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in\r\ndoing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side, in\r\nmy shrinking endeavors to fend him off.\r\n\r\nThe weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made us\r\nall lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way\r\nHouse behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozed\r\noff, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a\r\ncouple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him,\r\nand how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I\r\nwere going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the\r\nquestion up again.\r\n\r\nBut I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although\r\nI could recognize nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and\r\nshadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that\r\nblew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against\r\nthe wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first\r\nwords I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of\r\nmy own thought, "Two One Pound notes."\r\n\r\n"How did he get \'em?" said the convict I had never seen.\r\n\r\n"How should I know?" returned the other. "He had \'em stowed away\r\nsomehows. Giv him by friends, I expect."\r\n\r\n"I wish," said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, "that I had\r\n\'em here."\r\n\r\n"Two one pound notes, or friends?"\r\n\r\n"Two one pound notes. I\'d sell all the friends I ever had for one, and\r\nthink it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says--?"\r\n\r\n"So he says," resumed the convict I had recognized,--"it was all\r\nsaid and done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the\r\nDock-yard,--\'You\'re a going to be discharged?\' Yes, I was. Would I find\r\nout that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two\r\none pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did."\r\n\r\n"More fool you," growled the other. "I\'d have spent \'em on a Man, in\r\nwittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to say he knowed\r\nnothing of you?"\r\n\r\n"Not a ha\'porth. Different gangs and different ships. He was tried again\r\nfor prison breaking, and got made a Lifer."\r\n\r\n"And was that--Honor!--the only time you worked out, in this part of the\r\ncountry?"\r\n\r\n"The only time."\r\n\r\n"What might have been your opinion of the place?"\r\n\r\n"A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp,\r\nmist, and mudbank."\r\n\r\nThey both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually\r\ngrowled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.\r\n\r\nAfter overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and\r\nbeen left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling\r\ncertain that the man had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was not\r\nonly so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and\r\nso differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he could\r\nhave known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our\r\nbeing together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a\r\ndread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in his\r\nhearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as soon as\r\nwe touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing. This device I\r\nexecuted successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot under my\r\nfeet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down before\r\nme, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the first\r\nstones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their way\r\nwith the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off to\r\nthe river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for\r\nthem at the slime-washed stairs,--again heard the gruff "Give way, you!"\r\nlike and order to dogs,--again saw the wicked Noah\'s Ark lying out on\r\nthe black water.\r\n\r\nI could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether\r\nundefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me. As I walked on to\r\nthe hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension of\r\na painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble. I am confident\r\nthat it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the revival for a\r\nfew minutes of the terror of childhood.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty, and I had not only ordered\r\nmy dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waiter knew me. As\r\nsoon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory, he asked me\r\nif he should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook?\r\n\r\n"No," said I, "certainly not."\r\n\r\nThe waiter (it was he who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from the\r\nCommercials, on the day when I was bound) appeared surprised, and\r\ntook the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local\r\nnewspaper so directly in my way, that I took it up and read this\r\nparagraph:--\r\n\r\nOur readers will learn, not altogether without interest, in reference to\r\nthe recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this\r\nneighborhood (what a theme, by the way, for the magic pen of our as yet\r\nnot universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY, the poet of our columns!)\r\nthat the youth\'s earliest patron, companion, and friend, was a highly\r\nrespected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed\r\ntrade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises\r\nare situate within a hundred miles of the High Street. It is not wholly\r\nirrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM as the Mentor\r\nof our young Telemachus, for it is good to know that our town produced\r\nthe founder of the latter\'s fortunes. Does the thought-contracted brow\r\nof the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose\r\nfortunes? We believe that Quintin Matsys was the BLACKSMITH of Antwerp.\r\nVERB. SAP.\r\n\r\nI entertain a conviction, based upon large experience, that if in the\r\ndays of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have met\r\nsomebody there, wandering Esquimaux or civilized man, who would have\r\ntold me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my\r\nfortunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIX\r\n\r\nBetimes in the morning I was up and out. It was too early yet to go to\r\nMiss Havisham\'s, so I loitered into the country on Miss Havisham\'s\r\nside of town,--which was not Joe\'s side; I could go there\r\nto-morrow,--thinking about my patroness, and painting brilliant pictures\r\nof her plans for me.\r\n\r\nShe had adopted Estella, she had as good as adopted me, and it could not\r\nfail to be her intention to bring us together. She reserved it for me to\r\nrestore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark rooms,\r\nset the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear down the\r\ncobwebs, destroy the vermin,--in short, do all the shining deeds of the\r\nyoung Knight of romance, and marry the Princess. I had stopped to\r\nlook at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blocked\r\nwindows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with\r\nits twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich\r\nattractive mystery, of which I was the hero. Estella was the inspiration\r\nof it, and the heart of it, of course. But, though she had taken such\r\nstrong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so set upon\r\nher, though her influence on my boyish life and character had been\r\nall-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her with any\r\nattributes save those she possessed. I mention this in this place, of a\r\nfixed purpose, because it is the clew by which I am to be followed into\r\nmy poor labyrinth. According to my experience, the conventional notion\r\nof a lover cannot be always true. The unqualified truth is, that when I\r\nloved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her simply because I found\r\nher irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my sorrow, often and often,\r\nif not always, that I loved her against reason, against promise, against\r\npeace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that\r\ncould be. Once for all; I loved her none the less because I knew it,\r\nand it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly\r\nbelieved her to be human perfection.\r\n\r\nI so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time. When\r\nI had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my back upon the\r\ngate, while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart\r\nmoderately quiet. I heard the side-door open, and steps come across the\r\ncourtyard; but I pretended not to hear, even when the gate swung on its\r\nrusty hinges.\r\n\r\nBeing at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned. I started\r\nmuch more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a man in a sober\r\ngray dress. The last man I should have expected to see in that place of\r\nporter at Miss Havisham\'s door.\r\n\r\n"Orlick!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, young master, there\'s more changes than yours. But come in, come\r\nin. It\'s opposed to my orders to hold the gate open."\r\n\r\nI entered and he swung it, and locked it, and took the key out. "Yes!"\r\nsaid he, facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards\r\nthe house. "Here I am!"\r\n\r\n"How did you come here?"\r\n\r\n"I come her," he retorted, "on my legs. I had my box brought alongside\r\nme in a barrow."\r\n\r\n"Are you here for good?"\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t here for harm, young master, I suppose?"\r\n\r\nI was not so sure of that. I had leisure to entertain the retort in my\r\nmind, while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement, up my\r\nlegs and arms, to my face.\r\n\r\n"Then you have left the forge?" I said.\r\n\r\n"Do this look like a forge?" replied Orlick, sending his glance all\r\nround him with an air of injury. "Now, do it look like it?"\r\n\r\nI asked him how long he had left Gargery\'s forge?\r\n\r\n"One day is so like another here," he replied, "that I don\'t know\r\nwithout casting it up. However, I come here some time since you left."\r\n\r\n"I could have told you that, Orlick."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said he, dryly. "But then you\'ve got to be a scholar."\r\n\r\nBy this time we had come to the house, where I found his room to be one\r\njust within the side-door, with a little window in it looking on the\r\ncourtyard. In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of place\r\nusually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris. Certain keys were hanging on\r\nthe wall, to which he now added the gate key; and his patchwork-covered\r\nbed was in a little inner division or recess. The whole had a slovenly,\r\nconfined, and sleepy look, like a cage for a human dormouse; while he,\r\nlooming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window, looked\r\nlike the human dormouse for whom it was fitted up,--as indeed he was.\r\n\r\n"I never saw this room before," I remarked; "but there used to be no\r\nPorter here."\r\n\r\n"No," said he; "not till it got about that there was no protection on\r\nthe premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts and\r\nTag and Rag and Bobtail going up and down. And then I was recommended to\r\nthe place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought, and\r\nI took it. It\'s easier than bellowsing and hammering.--That\'s loaded,\r\nthat is."\r\n\r\nMy eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over the\r\nchimney-piece, and his eye had followed mine.\r\n\r\n"Well," said I, not desirous of more conversation, "shall I go up to\r\nMiss Havisham?"\r\n\r\n"Burn me, if I know!" he retorted, first stretching himself and then\r\nshaking himself; "my orders ends here, young master. I give this here\r\nbell a rap with this here hammer, and you go on along the passage till\r\nyou meet somebody."\r\n\r\n"I am expected, I believe?"\r\n\r\n"Burn me twice over, if I can say!" said he.\r\n\r\nUpon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in\r\nmy thick boots, and he made his bell sound. At the end of the passage,\r\nwhile the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, who\r\nappeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason\r\nof me.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said she. "You, is it, Mr. Pip?"\r\n\r\n"It is, Miss Pocket. I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and family\r\nare all well."\r\n\r\n"Are they any wiser?" said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head; "they\r\nhad better be wiser, than well. Ah, Matthew, Matthew! You know your way,\r\nsir?"\r\n\r\nTolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time. I\r\nascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old\r\nway at the door of Miss Havisham\'s room. "Pip\'s rap," I heard her say,\r\nimmediately; "come in, Pip."\r\n\r\nShe was in her chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her two\r\nhands crossed on her stick, her chin resting on them, and her eyes on\r\nthe fire. Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never been\r\nworn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was an elegant\r\nlady whom I had never seen.\r\n\r\n"Come in, Pip," Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking round\r\nor up; "come in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss my hand as if I\r\nwere a queen, eh?--Well?"\r\n\r\nShe looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated in a\r\ngrimly playful manner,--\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"I heard, Miss Havisham," said I, rather at a loss, "that you were so\r\nkind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\nThe lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her eyes and looked\r\narchly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella\'s eyes. But she\r\nwas so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly,\r\nin all things winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance,\r\nthat I seemed to have made none. I fancied, as I looked at her, that\r\nI slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again. O\r\nthe sense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and the\r\ninaccessibility that came about her!\r\n\r\nShe gave me her hand. I stammered something about the pleasure I felt in\r\nseeing her again, and about my having looked forward to it, for a long,\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\n"Do you find her much changed, Pip?" asked Miss Havisham, with her\r\ngreedy look, and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between\r\nthem, as a sign to me to sit down there.\r\n\r\n"When I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estella\r\nin the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously into the\r\nold--"\r\n\r\n"What? You are not going to say into the old Estella?" Miss Havisham\r\ninterrupted. "She was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go away\r\nfrom her. Don\'t you remember?"\r\n\r\nI said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better\r\nthen, and the like. Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said she\r\nhad no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her having been very\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\n"Is he changed?" Miss Havisham asked her.\r\n\r\n"Very much," said Estella, looking at me.\r\n\r\n"Less coarse and common?" said Miss Havisham, playing with Estella\'s\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nEstella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her hand, and laughed again,\r\nand looked at me, and put the shoe down. She treated me as a boy still,\r\nbut she lured me on.\r\n\r\nWe sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had\r\nso wrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home from\r\nFrance, and that she was going to London. Proud and wilful as of old,\r\nshe had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that\r\nit was impossible and out of nature--or I thought so--to separate them\r\nfrom her beauty. Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence\r\nfrom all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had\r\ndisturbed my boyhood,--from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had\r\nfirst made me ashamed of home and Joe,--from all those visions that had\r\nraised her face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the\r\nanvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden\r\nwindow of the forge, and flit away. In a word, it was impossible for me\r\nto separate her, in the past or in the present, from the innermost life\r\nof my life.\r\n\r\nIt was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and\r\nreturn to the hotel at night, and to London to-morrow. When we had\r\nconversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the\r\nneglected garden: on our coming in by and by, she said, I should wheel\r\nher about a little, as in times of yore.\r\n\r\nSo, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I\r\nhad strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert;\r\nI, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress; she,\r\nquite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. As we\r\ndrew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said,--\r\n\r\n"I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight\r\nthat day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much."\r\n\r\n"You rewarded me very much."\r\n\r\n"Did I?" she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. "I remember I\r\nentertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill\r\nthat he should be brought here to pester me with his company."\r\n\r\n"He and I are great friends now."\r\n\r\n"Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nI made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish\r\nlook, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy.\r\n\r\n"Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your\r\ncompanions," said Estella.\r\n\r\n"Naturally," said I.\r\n\r\n"And necessarily," she added, in a haughty tone; "what was fit company\r\nfor you once, would be quite unfit company for you now."\r\n\r\nIn my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering\r\nintention left of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put\r\nit to flight.\r\n\r\n"You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?" said\r\nEstella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fighting\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n"Not the least."\r\n\r\nThe air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my\r\nside, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at\r\nhers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in me\r\nmore than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being\r\nso set apart for her and assigned to her.\r\n\r\nThe garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and\r\nafter we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again\r\ninto the brewery yard. I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her\r\nwalking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold and\r\ncareless look in that direction, "Did I?" I reminded her where she had\r\ncome out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, "I\r\ndon\'t remember." "Not remember that you made me cry?" said I. "No," said\r\nshe, and shook her head and looked about her. I verily believe that\r\nher not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry again,\r\ninwardly,--and that is the sharpest crying of all.\r\n\r\n"You must know," said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and\r\nbeautiful woman might, "that I have no heart,--if that has anything to\r\ndo with my memory."\r\n\r\nI got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of\r\ndoubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt," said\r\nEstella, "and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease\r\nto be. But you know what I mean. I have no softness there,\r\nno--sympathy--sentiment--nonsense."\r\n\r\nWhat was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and\r\nlooked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham? No.\r\nIn some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance\r\nto Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by\r\nchildren, from grown person with whom they have been much associated and\r\nsecluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will produce a remarkable\r\noccasional likeness of expression between faces that are otherwise quite\r\ndifferent. And yet I could not trace this to Miss Havisham. I looked\r\nagain, and though she was still looking at me, the suggestion was gone.\r\n\r\nWhat was it?\r\n\r\n"I am serious," said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her brow was\r\nsmooth) as with a darkening of her face; "if we are to be thrown much\r\ntogether, you had better believe it at once. No!" imperiously stopping\r\nme as I opened my lips. "I have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere. I\r\nhave never had any such thing."\r\n\r\nIn another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and she\r\npointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same\r\nfirst day, and told me she remembered to have been up there, and to have\r\nseen me standing scared below. As my eyes followed her white hand, again\r\nthe same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed me. My\r\ninvoluntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm. Instantly\r\nthe ghost passed once more and was gone.\r\n\r\nWhat was it?\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" asked Estella. "Are you scared again?"\r\n\r\n"I should be, if I believed what you said just now," I replied, to turn\r\nit off.\r\n\r\n"Then you don\'t? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham will\r\nsoon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be\r\nlaid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more round\r\nof the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my\r\ncruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder."\r\n\r\nHer handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She held it in one hand\r\nnow, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked. We\r\nwalked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in\r\nbloom for me. If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of\r\nthe old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it could\r\nnot have been more cherished in my remembrance.\r\n\r\nThere was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me;\r\nwe were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more\r\nin her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which her\r\nbeauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the midst of my delight,\r\nand at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness had chosen\r\nus for one another. Wretched boy!\r\n\r\nAt last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise,\r\nthat my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, and\r\nwould come back to dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers in\r\nthe room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we\r\nwere out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.\r\n\r\nIt was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began\r\nthe old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast. But,\r\nin the funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the\r\nchair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright and beautiful\r\nthan before, and I was under stronger enchantment.\r\n\r\nThe time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand,\r\nand Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the centre\r\nof the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms\r\nstretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow\r\ncloth. As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the\r\ndoor, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity\r\nthat was of its kind quite dreadful.\r\n\r\nThen, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, and\r\nsaid in a whisper,--\r\n\r\n"Is she beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire her?"\r\n\r\n"Everybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham."\r\n\r\nShe drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers as\r\nshe sat in the chair. "Love her, love her, love her! How does she use\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nBefore I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a question\r\nat all) she repeated, "Love her, love her, love her! If she favors\r\nyou, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart to\r\npieces,--and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper,--love\r\nher, love her, love her!"\r\n\r\nNever had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her\r\nutterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm round\r\nmy neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her.\r\n\r\n"Hear me, Pip! I adopted her, to be loved. I bred her and educated her,\r\nto be loved. I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved.\r\nLove her!"\r\n\r\nShe said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she\r\nmeant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of\r\nlove--despair--revenge--dire death--it could not have sounded from her\r\nlips more like a curse.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you," said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper, "what\r\nreal love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation,\r\nutter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the\r\nwhole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter--as I\r\ndid!"\r\n\r\nWhen she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught\r\nher round the waist. For she rose up in the chair, in her shroud of a\r\ndress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck herself\r\nagainst the wall and fallen dead.\r\n\r\nAll this passed in a few seconds. As I drew her down into her chair, I\r\nwas conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nHe always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) a\r\npocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was\r\nof great value to him in his profession. I have seen him so terrify a\r\nclient or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief\r\nas if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and then pausing,\r\nas if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client\r\nor witness committed himself, that the self-committal has followed\r\ndirectly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw him in the room he had\r\nthis expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking at\r\nus. On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent pause\r\nin that attitude, "Indeed? Singular!" and then put the handkerchief to\r\nits right use with wonderful effect.\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was (like everybody\r\nelse) afraid of him. She made a strong attempt to compose herself, and\r\nstammered that he was as punctual as ever.\r\n\r\n"As punctual as ever," he repeated, coming up to us. "(How do you do,\r\nPip? Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?) And so you are\r\nhere, Pip?"\r\n\r\nI told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me to\r\ncome and see Estella. To which he replied, "Ah! Very fine young lady!"\r\nThen he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of his\r\nlarge hands, and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocket\r\nwere full of secrets.\r\n\r\n"Well, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?" said he, when\r\nhe came to a stop.\r\n\r\n"How often?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! How many times? Ten thousand times?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! Certainly not so many."\r\n\r\n"Twice?"\r\n\r\n"Jaggers," interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, "leave my Pip\r\nalone, and go with him to your dinner."\r\n\r\nHe complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. While\r\nwe were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved\r\nyard at the back, he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat\r\nand drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred\r\ntimes and once.\r\n\r\nI considered, and said, "Never."\r\n\r\n"And never will, Pip," he retorted, with a frowning smile. "She has\r\nnever allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived this\r\npresent life of hers. She wanders about in the night, and then lays\r\nhands on such food as she takes."\r\n\r\n"Pray, sir," said I, "may I ask you a question?"\r\n\r\n"You may," said he, "and I may decline to answer it. Put your question."\r\n\r\n"Estella\'s name. Is it Havisham or--?" I had nothing to add.\r\n\r\n"Or what?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Is it Havisham?"\r\n\r\n"It is Havisham."\r\n\r\nThis brought us to the dinner-table, where she and Sarah Pocket awaited\r\nus. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my\r\ngreen and yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on by a\r\nmaid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but\r\nwho, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole\r\ntime. After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my\r\nguardian (he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and the\r\ntwo ladies left us.\r\n\r\nAnything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that\r\nroof I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very looks to\r\nhimself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella\'s face once during\r\ndinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered,\r\nbut never looked at her, that I could see. On the other hand, she often\r\nlooked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his\r\nface never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took\r\na dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often\r\nreferring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here,\r\nagain, he showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he\r\nextorted--and even did extort, though I don\'t know how--those references\r\nout of my innocent self.\r\n\r\nAnd when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air upon him\r\nof general lying by in consequence of information he possessed, that\r\nreally was too much for me. He cross-examined his very wine when he had\r\nnothing else in hand. He held it between himself and the candle, tasted\r\nthe port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his\r\nglass again, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and\r\ncross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had known\r\nthe wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage. Three or four\r\ntimes I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he saw\r\nme going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in his\r\nhand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to\r\ntake notice that it was of no use, for he couldn\'t answer.\r\n\r\nI think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her\r\nin the danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off her\r\ncap,--which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,--and\r\nstrewing the ground with her hair,--which assuredly had never grown\r\non her head. She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss\r\nHavisham\'s room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Miss\r\nHavisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels\r\nfrom her dressing-table into Estella\'s hair, and about her bosom and\r\narms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick\r\neyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him,\r\nwith those rich flushes of glitter and color in it.\r\n\r\nOf the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, and\r\ncame out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the\r\nglory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor, of\r\nthe feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us personally in the\r\nlight of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long\r\nago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his cold\r\npresence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that I knew I could\r\nnever bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could never bear to\r\nhear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bear to see\r\nhim wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be within\r\na foot or two of him,--it was, that my feelings should be in the same\r\nplace with him,--that, was the agonizing circumstance.\r\n\r\nWe played until nine o\'clock, and then it was arranged that when Estella\r\ncame to London I should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her\r\nat the coach; and then I took leave of her, and touched her and left\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMy guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine. Far into the\r\nnight, Miss Havisham\'s words, "Love her, love her, love her!" sounded in\r\nmy ears. I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to my pillow, "I\r\nlove her, I love her, I love her!" hundreds of times. Then, a burst of\r\ngratitude came upon me, that she should be destined for me, once the\r\nblacksmith\'s boy. Then I thought if she were, as I feared, by no means\r\nrapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when would she begin to be\r\ninterested in me? When should I awaken the heart within her that was\r\nmute and sleeping now?\r\n\r\nAh me! I thought those were high and great emotions. But I never thought\r\nthere was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe, because\r\nI knew she would be contemptuous of him. It was but a day gone, and Joe\r\nhad brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, God forgive me!\r\nsoon dried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXX\r\n\r\nAfter well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar\r\nin the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick\'s\r\nbeing the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham\'s.\r\n"Why of course he is not the right sort of man, Pip," said my guardian,\r\ncomfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, "because the man\r\nwho fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man." It seemed\r\nquite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was\r\nnot exceptionally held by the right sort of man, and he listened in a\r\nsatisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick. "Very\r\ngood, Pip," he observed, when I had concluded, "I\'ll go round presently,\r\nand pay our friend off." Rather alarmed by this summary action, I was\r\nfor a little delay, and even hinted that our friend himself might be\r\ndifficult to deal with. "Oh no he won\'t," said my guardian, making his\r\npocket-handkerchief-point, with perfect confidence; "I should like to\r\nsee him argue the question with me."\r\n\r\nAs we were going back together to London by the midday coach, and as I\r\nbreakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely hold\r\nmy cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a walk, and\r\nthat I would go on along the London road while Mr. Jaggers was occupied,\r\nif he would let the coachman know that I would get into my place when\r\novertaken. I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar immediately\r\nafter breakfast. By then making a loop of about a couple of miles into\r\nthe open country at the back of Pumblechook\'s premises, I got round into\r\nthe High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and felt myself in\r\ncomparative security.\r\n\r\nIt was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was not\r\ndisagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after.\r\nOne or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went\r\na little way down the street before me, that they might turn, as if they\r\nhad forgotten something, and pass me face to face,--on which occasions I\r\ndon\'t know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they of not doing\r\nit, or I of not seeing it. Still my position was a distinguished one,\r\nand I was not at all dissatisfied with it, until Fate threw me in the\r\nway of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb\'s boy.\r\n\r\nCasting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, I\r\nbeheld Trabb\'s boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty blue bag.\r\nDeeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best\r\nbeseem me, and would be most likely to quell his evil mind, I advanced\r\nwith that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulating\r\nmyself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabb\'s boy smote\r\ntogether, his hair uprose, his cap fell off, he trembled violently in\r\nevery limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace,\r\n"Hold me! I\'m so frightened!" feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and\r\ncontrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance. As I passed him,\r\nhis teeth loudly chattered in his head, and with every mark of extreme\r\nhumiliation, he prostrated himself in the dust.\r\n\r\nThis was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. I had not advanced\r\nanother two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement,\r\nand indignation, I again beheld Trabb\'s boy approaching. He was coming\r\nround a narrow corner. His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honest\r\nindustry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb\'s with\r\ncheerful briskness was indicated in his gait. With a shock he became\r\naware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time his\r\nmotion was rotatory, and he staggered round and round me with knees\r\nmore afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy. His\r\nsufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators,\r\nand I felt utterly confounded.\r\n\r\nI had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when I\r\nagain beheld Trabb\'s boy shooting round by a back way. This time, he was\r\nentirely changed. He wore the blue bag in the manner of my great-coat,\r\nand was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of\r\nthe street, attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he\r\nfrom time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his hand, "Don\'t know yah!"\r\nWords cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon\r\nme by Trabb\'s boy, when passing abreast of me, he pulled up his\r\nshirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an arm akimbo, and smirked\r\nextravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body, and drawling to his\r\nattendants, "Don\'t know yah, don\'t know yah, \'pon my soul don\'t know\r\nyah!" The disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking\r\nto crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows, as from an\r\nexceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith,\r\nculminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and was, so to\r\nspeak, ejected by it into the open country.\r\n\r\nBut unless I had taken the life of Trabb\'s boy on that occasion, I\r\nreally do not even now see what I could have done save endure. To\r\nhave struggled with him in the street, or to have exacted any lower\r\nrecompense from him than his heart\'s best blood, would have been\r\nfutile and degrading. Moreover, he was a boy whom no man could hurt; an\r\ninvulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a corner, flew\r\nout again between his captor\'s legs, scornfully yelping. I wrote,\r\nhowever, to Mr. Trabb by next day\'s post, to say that Mr. Pip must\r\ndecline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed to\r\nthe best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excited Loathing\r\nin every respectable mind.\r\n\r\nThe coach, with Mr. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I took my\r\nbox-seat again, and arrived in London safe,--but not sound, for my heart\r\nwas gone. As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrel\r\nof oysters to Joe (as reparation for not having gone myself), and then\r\nwent on to Barnard\'s Inn.\r\n\r\nI found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back.\r\nHaving despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition to the\r\ndinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my friend\r\nand chum. As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger in the\r\nhall, which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to\r\nthe keyhole, I sent him to the Play. A better proof of the severity\r\nof my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded, than\r\nthe degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to find him\r\nemployment. So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent him to Hyde Park\r\ncorner to see what o\'clock it was.\r\n\r\nDinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to\r\nHerbert, "My dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"My dear Handel," he returned, "I shall esteem and respect your\r\nconfidence."\r\n\r\n"It concerns myself, Herbert," said I, "and one other person."\r\n\r\nHerbert crossed his feet, looked at the fire with his head on one side,\r\nand having looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me because I\r\ndidn\'t go on.\r\n\r\n"Herbert," said I, laying my hand upon his knee, "I love--I\r\nadore--Estella."\r\n\r\nInstead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easy matter-of-course\r\nway, "Exactly. Well?"\r\n\r\n"Well, Herbert? Is that all you say? Well?"\r\n\r\n"What next, I mean?" said Herbert. "Of course I know that."\r\n\r\n"How do you know it?" said I.\r\n\r\n"How do I know it, Handel? Why, from you."\r\n\r\n"I never told you."\r\n\r\n"Told me! You have never told me when you have got your hair cut, but I\r\nhave had senses to perceive it. You have always adored her, ever since\r\nI have known you. You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here\r\ntogether. Told me! Why, you have always told me all day long. When you\r\ntold me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring her\r\nthe first time you saw her, when you were very young indeed."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then," said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome\r\nlight, "I have never left off adoring her. And she has come back, a most\r\nbeautiful and most elegant creature. And I saw her yesterday. And if I\r\nadored her before, I now doubly adore her."\r\n\r\n"Lucky for you then, Handel," said Herbert, "that you are picked out for\r\nher and allotted to her. Without encroaching on forbidden ground, we\r\nmay venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of\r\nthat fact. Have you any idea yet, of Estella\'s views on the adoration\r\nquestion?"\r\n\r\nI shook my head gloomily. "Oh! She is thousands of miles away, from me,"\r\nsaid I.\r\n\r\n"Patience, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough. But you have\r\nsomething more to say?"\r\n\r\n"I am ashamed to say it," I returned, "and yet it\'s no worse to say it\r\nthan to think it. You call me a lucky fellow. Of course, I am. I was a\r\nblacksmith\'s boy but yesterday; I am--what shall I say I am--to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Say a good fellow, if you want a phrase," returned Herbert, smiling,\r\nand clapping his hand on the back of mine--"a good fellow, with\r\nimpetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action and\r\ndreaming, curiously mixed in him."\r\n\r\nI stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture\r\nin my character. On the whole, I by no means recognized the analysis,\r\nbut thought it not worth disputing.\r\n\r\n"When I ask what I am to call myself to-day, Herbert," I went on, "I\r\nsuggest what I have in my thoughts. You say I am lucky. I know I have\r\ndone nothing to raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raised\r\nme; that is being very lucky. And yet, when I think of Estella--"\r\n\r\n("And when don\'t you, you know?" Herbert threw in, with his eyes on the\r\nfire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him.)\r\n\r\n"--Then, my dear Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain\r\nI feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances. Avoiding forbidden\r\nground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the constancy of\r\none person (naming no person) all my expectations depend. And at the\r\nbest, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely what\r\nthey are!" In saying this, I relieved my mind of what had always been\r\nthere, more or less, though no doubt most since yesterday.\r\n\r\n"Now, Handel," Herbert replied, in his gay, hopeful way, "it seems to me\r\nthat in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into our\r\ngift-horse\'s mouth with a magnifying-glass. Likewise, it seems to me\r\nthat, concentrating our attention on the examination, we altogether\r\noverlook one of the best points of the animal. Didn\'t you tell me that\r\nyour guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were\r\nnot endowed with expectations only? And even if he had not told you\r\nso,--though that is a very large If, I grant,--could you believe that of\r\nall men in London, Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his present relations\r\ntowards you unless he were sure of his ground?"\r\n\r\nI said I could not deny that this was a strong point. I said it (people\r\noften do so, in such cases) like a rather reluctant concession to truth\r\nand justice;--as if I wanted to deny it!\r\n\r\n"I should think it was a strong point," said Herbert, "and I should\r\nthink you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you\r\nmust bide your guardian\'s time, and he must bide his client\'s time.\r\nYou\'ll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are, and then perhaps\r\nyou\'ll get some further enlightenment. At all events, you\'ll be nearer\r\ngetting it, for it must come at last."\r\n\r\n"What a hopeful disposition you have!" said I, gratefully admiring his\r\ncheery ways.\r\n\r\n"I ought to have," said Herbert, "for I have not much else. I must\r\nacknowledge, by the by, that the good sense of what I have just said is\r\nnot my own, but my father\'s. The only remark I ever heard him make on\r\nyour story, was the final one, "The thing is settled and done, or Mr.\r\nJaggers would not be in it." And now before I say anything more about my\r\nfather, or my father\'s son, and repay confidence with confidence, I want\r\nto make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a moment,--positively\r\nrepulsive."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t succeed," said I.\r\n\r\n"O yes I shall!" said he. "One, two, three, and now I am in for it.\r\nHandel, my good fellow;"--though he spoke in this light tone, he was\r\nvery much in earnest,--"I have been thinking since we have been talking\r\nwith our feet on this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a condition\r\nof your inheritance, if she was never referred to by your guardian. Am\r\nI right in so understanding what you have told me, as that he never\r\nreferred to her, directly or indirectly, in any way? Never even hinted,\r\nfor instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage\r\nultimately?"\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"Now, Handel, I am quite free from the flavor of sour grapes, upon my\r\nsoul and honor! Not being bound to her, can you not detach yourself from\r\nher?--I told you I should be disagreeable."\r\n\r\nI turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old marsh\r\nwinds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which had subdued\r\nme on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists were solemnly\r\nrising, and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post, smote upon\r\nmy heart again. There was silence between us for a little while.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but my dear Handel," Herbert went on, as if we had been talking,\r\ninstead of silent, "its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of\r\na boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very\r\nserious. Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham. Think of\r\nwhat she is herself (now I am repulsive and you abominate me). This may\r\nlead to miserable things."\r\n\r\n"I know it, Herbert," said I, with my head still turned away, "but I\r\ncan\'t help it."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t detach yourself?"\r\n\r\n"No. Impossible!"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t try, Handel?"\r\n\r\n"No. Impossible!"\r\n\r\n"Well!" said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had\r\nbeen asleep, and stirring the fire, "now I\'ll endeavor to make myself\r\nagreeable again!"\r\n\r\nSo he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs\r\nin their places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about,\r\nlooked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, and\r\ncame back to his chair by the fire: where he sat down, nursing his left\r\nleg in both arms.\r\n\r\n"I was going to say a word or two, Handel, concerning my father and my\r\nfather\'s son. I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father\'s son\r\nto remark that my father\'s establishment is not particularly brilliant\r\nin its housekeeping."\r\n\r\n"There is always plenty, Herbert," said I, to say something encouraging.\r\n\r\n"O yes! and so the dustman says, I believe, with the strongest approval,\r\nand so does the marine-store shop in the back street. Gravely, Handel,\r\nfor the subject is grave enough, you know how it is as well as I do. I\r\nsuppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up;\r\nbut if ever there was, the time is gone. May I ask you if you have ever\r\nhad an opportunity of remarking, down in your part of the country,\r\nthat the children of not exactly suitable marriages are always most\r\nparticularly anxious to be married?"\r\n\r\nThis was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, "Is it\r\nso?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Herbert, "that\'s what I want to know. Because it\r\nis decidedly the case with us. My poor sister Charlotte, who was next me\r\nand died before she was fourteen, was a striking example. Little Jane\r\nis the same. In her desire to be matrimonially established, you\r\nmight suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual\r\ncontemplation of domestic bliss. Little Alick in a frock has already\r\nmade arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew. And\r\nindeed, I think we are all engaged, except the baby."\r\n\r\n"Then you are?" said I.\r\n\r\n"I am," said Herbert; "but it\'s a secret."\r\n\r\nI assured him of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favored with\r\nfurther particulars. He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my\r\nweakness that I wanted to know something about his strength.\r\n\r\n"May I ask the name?" I said.\r\n\r\n"Name of Clara," said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Live in London?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, perhaps I ought to mention," said Herbert, who had become\r\ncuriously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting\r\ntheme, "that she is rather below my mother\'s nonsensical family notions.\r\nHer father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships. I think he\r\nwas a species of purser."\r\n\r\n"What is he now?" said I.\r\n\r\n"He\'s an invalid now," replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Living on--?"\r\n\r\n"On the first floor," said Herbert. Which was not at all what I meant,\r\nfor I had intended my question to apply to his means. "I have never seen\r\nhim, for he has always kept his room overhead, since I have known Clara.\r\nBut I have heard him constantly. He makes tremendous rows,--roars, and\r\npegs at the floor with some frightful instrument." In looking at me and\r\nthen laughing heartily, Herbert for the time recovered his usual lively\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you expect to see him?" said I.\r\n\r\n"O yes, I constantly expect to see him," returned Herbert, "because\r\nI never hear him, without expecting him to come tumbling through the\r\nceiling. But I don\'t know how long the rafters may hold."\r\n\r\nWhen he had once more laughed heartily, he became meek again, and told\r\nme that the moment he began to realize Capital, it was his intention\r\nto marry this young lady. He added as a self-evident proposition,\r\nengendering low spirits, "But you can\'t marry, you know, while you\'re\r\nlooking about you."\r\n\r\nAs we contemplated the fire, and as I thought what a difficult vision to\r\nrealize this same Capital sometimes was, I put my hands in my pockets.\r\nA folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention, I opened\r\nit and found it to be the play-bill I had received from Joe, relative\r\nto the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian renown. "And bless my\r\nheart," I involuntarily added aloud, "it\'s to-night!"\r\n\r\nThis changed the subject in an instant, and made us hurriedly resolve\r\nto go to the play. So, when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet\r\nHerbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable\r\nmeans, and when Herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me\r\nby reputation and that I should be presented to her, and when we had\r\nwarmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence, we blew out our candles,\r\nmade up our fire, locked our door, and issued forth in quest of Mr.\r\nWopsle and Denmark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXI\r\n\r\nOn our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country\r\nelevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. The\r\nwhole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble\r\nboy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer\r\nwith a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life,\r\nand the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white\r\nsilk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My gifted\r\ntownsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could have wished\r\nthat his curls and forehead had been more probable.\r\n\r\nSeveral curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded.\r\nThe late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled\r\nwith a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it with him\r\nto the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom also carried\r\na ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had the appearance\r\nof occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of anxiety and a\r\ntendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state\r\nof mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led to the Shade\'s being\r\nadvised by the gallery to "turn over!"--a recommendation which it took\r\nextremely ill. It was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit, that\r\nwhereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time\r\nand walked an immense distance, it perceptibly came from a closely\r\ncontiguous wall. This occasioned its terrors to be received derisively.\r\nThe Queen of Denmark, a very buxom lady, though no doubt historically\r\nbrazen, was considered by the public to have too much brass about her;\r\nher chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of that metal (as\r\nif she had a gorgeous toothache), her waist being encircled by another,\r\nand each of her arms by another, so that she was openly mentioned\r\nas "the kettle-drum." The noble boy in the ancestral boots was\r\ninconsistent, representing himself, as it were in one breath, as an able\r\nseaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a clergyman, and a person\r\nof the utmost importance at a Court fencing-match, on the authority\r\nof whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were\r\njudged. This gradually led to a want of toleration for him, and even--on\r\nhis being detected in holy orders, and declining to perform the funeral\r\nservice--to the general indignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly,\r\nOphelia was a prey to such slow musical madness, that when, in course of\r\ntime, she had taken off her white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried\r\nit, a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an\r\niron bar in the front row of the gallery, growled, "Now the baby\'s put\r\nto bed let\'s have supper!" Which, to say the least of it, was out of\r\nkeeping.\r\n\r\nUpon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with\r\nplayful effect. Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or\r\nstate a doubt, the public helped him out with it. As for example; on the\r\nquestion whether \'twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared yes,\r\nand some no, and some inclining to both opinions said "Toss up for\r\nit;" and quite a Debating Society arose. When he asked what should such\r\nfellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven, he was encouraged\r\nwith loud cries of "Hear, hear!" When he appeared with his stocking\r\ndisordered (its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one very neat\r\nfold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat iron),\r\na conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his\r\nleg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him.\r\nOn his taking the recorders,--very like a little black flute that had\r\njust been played in the orchestra and handed out at the door,--he was\r\ncalled upon unanimously for Rule Britannia. When he recommended the\r\nplayer not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said, "And don\'t you do\r\nit, neither; you\'re a deal worse than him!" And I grieve to add that\r\npeals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of these occasions.\r\n\r\nBut his greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had the appearance\r\nof a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical wash-house\r\non one side, and a turnpike gate on the other. Mr. Wopsle in a\r\ncomprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike,\r\nthe gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, "Look out! Here\'s the\r\nundertaker a coming, to see how you\'re a getting on with your work!"\r\nI believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle\r\ncould not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it,\r\nwithout dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast;\r\nbut even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the\r\ncomment, "Wai-ter!" The arrival of the body for interment (in an empty\r\nblack box with the lid tumbling open), was the signal for a general\r\njoy, which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the bearers, of\r\nan individual obnoxious to identification. The joy attended Mr. Wopsle\r\nthrough his struggle with Laertes on the brink of the orchestra and\r\nthe grave, and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the\r\nkitchen-table, and had died by inches from the ankles upward.\r\n\r\nWe had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle;\r\nbut they were too hopeless to be persisted in. Therefore we had sat,\r\nfeeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. I\r\nlaughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll;\r\nand yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly\r\nfine in Mr. Wopsle\'s elocution,--not for old associations\' sake, I am\r\nafraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill and\r\ndownhill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural\r\ncircumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything.\r\nWhen the tragedy was over, and he had been called for and hooted, I said\r\nto Herbert, "Let us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him."\r\n\r\nWe made all the haste we could downstairs, but we were not quick enough\r\neither. Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy\r\nsmear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we\r\ncame up with him,--\r\n\r\n"Mr. Pip and friend?"\r\n\r\nIdentity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Waldengarver," said the man, "would be glad to have the honor."\r\n\r\n"Waldengarver?" I repeated--when Herbert murmured in my ear, "Probably\r\nWopsle."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said I. "Yes. Shall we follow you?"\r\n\r\n"A few steps, please." When we were in a side alley, he turned and\r\nasked, "How did you think he looked?--I dressed him."\r\n\r\nI don\'t know what he had looked like, except a funeral; with the\r\naddition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a\r\nblue ribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in some\r\nextraordinary Fire Office. But I said he had looked very nice.\r\n\r\n"When he come to the grave," said our conductor, "he showed his cloak\r\nbeautiful. But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when he\r\nsee the ghost in the queen\'s apartment, he might have made more of his\r\nstockings."\r\n\r\nI modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door,\r\ninto a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it. Here Mr. Wopsle\r\nwas divesting himself of his Danish garments, and here there was just\r\nroom for us to look at him over one another\'s shoulders, by keeping the\r\npacking-case door, or lid, wide open.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," said Mr. Wopsle, "I am proud to see you. I hope, Mr. Pip,\r\nyou will excuse my sending round. I had the happiness to know you in\r\nformer times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been\r\nacknowledged, on the noble and the affluent."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to\r\nget himself out of his princely sables.\r\n\r\n"Skin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver," said the owner of that\r\nproperty, "or you\'ll bust \'em. Bust \'em, and you\'ll bust five-and-thirty\r\nshillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair. Keep\r\nquiet in your chair now, and leave \'em to me."\r\n\r\nWith that, he went upon his knees, and began to flay his victim; who, on\r\nthe first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over backward\r\nwith his chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow.\r\n\r\nI had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then, Mr.\r\nWaldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,--\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?"\r\n\r\nHerbert said from behind (at the same time poking me), "Capitally." So I\r\nsaid "Capitally."\r\n\r\n"How did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?" said Mr.\r\nWaldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.\r\n\r\nHerbert said from behind (again poking me), "Massive and concrete." So I\r\nsaid boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon it,\r\n"Massive and concrete."\r\n\r\n"I am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen," said Mr. Waldengarver,\r\nwith an air of dignity, in spite of his being ground against the wall at\r\nthe time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.\r\n\r\n"But I\'ll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver," said the man who was on\r\nhis knees, "in which you\'re out in your reading. Now mind! I don\'t care\r\nwho says contrairy; I tell you so. You\'re out in your reading of Hamlet\r\nwhen you get your legs in profile. The last Hamlet as I dressed, made\r\nthe same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to put a\r\nlarge red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal (which\r\nwas the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and whenever\r\nhis reading brought him into profile, I called out "I don\'t see no\r\nwafers!" And at night his reading was lovely."\r\n\r\nMr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say "a faithful\r\nDependent--I overlook his folly;" and then said aloud, "My view is a\r\nlittle classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve, they\r\nwill improve."\r\n\r\nHerbert and I said together, O, no doubt they would improve.\r\n\r\n"Did you observe, gentlemen," said Mr. Waldengarver, "that there was a\r\nman in the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the service,--I\r\nmean, the representation?"\r\n\r\nWe basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man. I\r\nadded, "He was drunk, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"O dear no, sir," said Mr. Wopsle, "not drunk. His employer would see to\r\nthat, sir. His employer would not allow him to be drunk."\r\n\r\n"You know his employer?" said I.\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle shut his eyes, and opened them again; performing both\r\nceremonies very slowly. "You must have observed, gentlemen," said he,\r\n"an ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance\r\nexpressive of low malignity, who went through--I will not say\r\nsustained--the r\xc3\xb4le (if I may use a French expression) of Claudius, King\r\nof Denmark. That is his employer, gentlemen. Such is the profession!"\r\n\r\nWithout distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for Mr.\r\nWopsle if he had been in despair, I was so sorry for him as it was,\r\nthat I took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces\r\nput on,--which jostled us out at the doorway,--to ask Herbert what he\r\nthought of having him home to supper? Herbert said he thought it would\r\nbe kind to do so; therefore I invited him, and he went to Barnard\'s\r\nwith us, wrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him, and he sat\r\nuntil two o\'clock in the morning, reviewing his success and developing\r\nhis plans. I forget in detail what they were, but I have a general\r\nrecollection that he was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to end\r\nwith crushing it; inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft\r\nand without a chance or hope.\r\n\r\nMiserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Estella, and\r\nmiserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and that I\r\nhad to give my hand in marriage to Herbert\'s Clara, or play Hamlet to\r\nMiss Havisham\'s Ghost, before twenty thousand people, without knowing\r\ntwenty words of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXII\r\n\r\nOne day when I was busy with my books and Mr. Pocket, I received a note\r\nby the post, the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter;\r\nfor, though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed,\r\nI divined whose hand it was. It had no set beginning, as Dear Mr. Pip,\r\nor Dear Pip, or Dear Sir, or Dear Anything, but ran thus:--\r\n\r\n"I am to come to London the day after to-morrow by the midday coach. I\r\nbelieve it was settled you should meet me? At all events Miss Havisham\r\nhas that impression, and I write in obedience to it. She sends you her\r\nregard.\r\n\r\n"Yours, ESTELLA."\r\n\r\nIf there had been time, I should probably have ordered several suits\r\nof clothes for this occasion; but as there was not, I was fain to be\r\ncontent with those I had. My appetite vanished instantly, and I knew\r\nno peace or rest until the day arrived. Not that its arrival brought\r\nme either; for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting the\r\ncoach-office in Wood Street, Cheapside, before the coach had left the\r\nBlue Boar in our town. For all that I knew this perfectly well, I still\r\nfelt as if it were not safe to let the coach-office be out of my sight\r\nlonger than five minutes at a time; and in this condition of unreason I\r\nhad performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours, when\r\nWemmick ran against me.\r\n\r\n"Halloa, Mr. Pip," said he; "how do you do? I should hardly have thought\r\nthis was your beat."\r\n\r\nI explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by\r\ncoach, and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged.\r\n\r\n"Both flourishing thankye," said Wemmick, "and particularly the Aged.\r\nHe\'s in wonderful feather. He\'ll be eighty-two next birthday. I have\r\na notion of firing eighty-two times, if the neighborhood shouldn\'t\r\ncomplain, and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure.\r\nHowever, this is not London talk. Where do you think I am going to?"\r\n\r\n"To the office?" said I, for he was tending in that direction.\r\n\r\n"Next thing to it," returned Wemmick, "I am going to Newgate. We are in\r\na banker\'s-parcel case just at present, and I have been down the road\r\ntaking a squint at the scene of action, and thereupon must have a word\r\nor two with our client."\r\n\r\n"Did your client commit the robbery?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Bless your soul and body, no," answered Wemmick, very drily. "But he\r\nis accused of it. So might you or I be. Either of us might be accused of\r\nit, you know."\r\n\r\n"Only neither of us is," I remarked.\r\n\r\n"Yah!" said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with his forefinger;\r\n"you\'re a deep one, Mr. Pip! Would you like to have a look at Newgate?\r\nHave you time to spare?"\r\n\r\nI had so much time to spare, that the proposal came as a relief,\r\nnotwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my\r\neye on the coach-office. Muttering that I would make the inquiry whether\r\nI had time to walk with him, I went into the office, and ascertained\r\nfrom the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his\r\ntemper, the earliest moment at which the coach could be expected,--which\r\nI knew beforehand, quite as well as he. I then rejoined Mr. Wemmick, and\r\naffecting to consult my watch, and to be surprised by the information I\r\nhad received, accepted his offer.\r\n\r\nWe were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge\r\nwhere some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison\r\nrules, into the interior of the jail. At that time jails were much\r\nneglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on\r\nall public wrongdoing--and which is always its heaviest and longest\r\npunishment--was still far off. So, felons were not lodged and fed better\r\nthan soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set fire to their\r\nprisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup.\r\nIt was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman was going his\r\nrounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards, were buying\r\nbeer, and talking to friends; and a frowzy, ugly, disorderly, depressing\r\nscene it was.\r\n\r\nIt struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener\r\nmight walk among his plants. This was first put into my head by his\r\nseeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, "What, Captain\r\nTom? Are you there? Ah, indeed!" and also, "Is that Black Bill behind\r\nthe cistern? Why I didn\'t look for you these two months; how do you find\r\nyourself?" Equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to\r\nanxious whisperers,--always singly,--Wemmick with his post-office in\r\nan immovable state, looked at them while in conference, as if he were\r\ntaking particular notice of the advance they had made, since last\r\nobserved, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.\r\n\r\nHe was highly popular, and I found that he took the familiar department\r\nof Mr. Jaggers\'s business; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers\r\nhung about him too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits. His\r\npersonal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod,\r\nand in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both\r\nhands, and then tightening the post-office, and putting his hands in his\r\npockets. In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the\r\nraising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible from\r\nthe insufficient money produced, said, "it\'s no use, my boy. I\'m only\r\na subordinate. I can\'t take it. Don\'t go on in that way with a\r\nsubordinate. If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you had\r\nbetter address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principals\r\nin the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one, may\r\nbe worth the while of another; that\'s my recommendation to you, speaking\r\nas a subordinate. Don\'t try on useless measures. Why should you? Now,\r\nwho\'s next?"\r\n\r\nThus, we walked through Wemmick\'s greenhouse, until he turned to me and\r\nsaid, "Notice the man I shall shake hands with." I should have done so,\r\nwithout the preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet.\r\n\r\nAlmost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I can\r\nsee now, as I write) in a well-worn olive-colored frock-coat, with a\r\npeculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion, and eyes that\r\nwent wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner\r\nof the bars, and put his hand to his hat--which had a greasy and fatty\r\nsurface like cold broth--with a half-serious and half-jocose military\r\nsalute.\r\n\r\n"Colonel, to you!" said Wemmick; "how are you, Colonel?"\r\n\r\n"All right, Mr. Wemmick."\r\n\r\n"Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too strong\r\nfor us, Colonel."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was too strong, sir,--but I don\'t care."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Wemmick, coolly, "you don\'t care." Then, turning to me,\r\n"Served His Majesty this man. Was a soldier in the line and bought his\r\ndischarge."\r\n\r\nI said, "Indeed?" and the man\'s eyes looked at me, and then looked over\r\nmy head, and then looked all round me, and then he drew his hand across\r\nhis lips and laughed.\r\n\r\n"I think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir," he said to Wemmick.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," returned my friend, "but there\'s no knowing."\r\n\r\n"I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-bye, Mr. Wemmick," said\r\nthe man, stretching out his hand between two bars.\r\n\r\n"Thankye," said Wemmick, shaking hands with him. "Same to you, Colonel."\r\n\r\n"If what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mr. Wemmick," said the\r\nman, unwilling to let his hand go, "I should have asked the favor of\r\nyour wearing another ring--in acknowledgment of your attentions."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll accept the will for the deed," said Wemmick. "By the by; you were\r\nquite a pigeon-fancier." The man looked up at the sky. "I am told you\r\nhad a remarkable breed of tumblers. Could you commission any friend of\r\nyours to bring me a pair, if you\'ve no further use for \'em?"\r\n\r\n"It shall be done, sir."\r\n\r\n"All right," said Wemmick, "they shall be taken care of. Good afternoon,\r\nColonel. Good-bye!" They shook hands again, and as we walked away Wemmick\r\nsaid to me, "A Coiner, a very good workman. The Recorder\'s report is\r\nmade to-day, and he is sure to be executed on Monday. Still you see, as\r\nfar as it goes, a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same."\r\nWith that, he looked back, and nodded at this dead plant, and then cast\r\nhis eyes about him in walking out of the yard, as if he were considering\r\nwhat other pot would go best in its place.\r\n\r\nAs we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the great\r\nimportance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less\r\nthan by those whom they held in charge. "Well, Mr. Wemmick," said the\r\nturnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates,\r\nand who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other, "what\'s Mr.\r\nJaggers going to do with that water-side murder? Is he going to make it\r\nmanslaughter, or what\'s he going to make of it?"\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you ask him?" returned Wemmick.\r\n\r\n"O yes, I dare say!" said the turnkey.\r\n\r\n"Now, that\'s the way with them here, Mr. Pip," remarked Wemmick, turning\r\nto me with his post-office elongated. "They don\'t mind what they ask of\r\nme, the subordinate; but you\'ll never catch \'em asking any questions of\r\nmy principal."\r\n\r\n"Is this young gentleman one of the \'prentices or articled ones of your\r\noffice?" asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr. Wemmick\'s humor.\r\n\r\n"There he goes again, you see!" cried Wemmick, "I told you so! Asks\r\nanother question of the subordinate before his first is dry! Well,\r\nsupposing Mr. Pip is one of them?"\r\n\r\n"Why then," said the turnkey, grinning again, "he knows what Mr. Jaggers\r\nis."\r\n\r\n"Yah!" cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious\r\nway, "you\'re dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my\r\nprincipal, you know you are. Let us out, you old fox, or I\'ll get him to\r\nbring an action against you for false imprisonment."\r\n\r\nThe turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at us over\r\nthe spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street.\r\n\r\n"Mind you, Mr. Pip," said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he took my arm\r\nto be more confidential; "I don\'t know that Mr. Jaggers does a better\r\nthing than the way in which he keeps himself so high. He\'s always so\r\nhigh. His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities. That\r\nColonel durst no more take leave of him, than that turnkey durst ask him\r\nhis intentions respecting a case. Then, between his height and them, he\r\nslips in his subordinate,--don\'t you see?--and so he has \'em, soul and\r\nbody."\r\n\r\nI was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my guardian\'s\r\nsubtlety. To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for the\r\nfirst time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities.\r\n\r\nMr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where\r\nsuppliants for Mr. Jaggers\'s notice were lingering about as usual, and I\r\nreturned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some three\r\nhours on hand. I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it\r\nwas that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime;\r\nthat, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening, I\r\nshould have first encountered it; that, it should have reappeared on two\r\noccasions, starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone; that,\r\nit should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement. While my\r\nmind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautiful young Estella, proud\r\nand refined, coming towards me, and I thought with absolute abhorrence\r\nof the contrast between the jail and her. I wished that Wemmick had not\r\nmet me, or that I had not yielded to him and gone with him, so that,\r\nof all days in the year on this day, I might not have had Newgate in\r\nmy breath and on my clothes. I beat the prison dust off my feet as I\r\nsauntered to and fro, and I shook it out of my dress, and I exhaled\r\nits air from my lungs. So contaminated did I feel, remembering who was\r\ncoming, that the coach came quickly after all, and I was not yet free\r\nfrom the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick\'s conservatory, when I saw\r\nher face at the coach window and her hand waving to me.\r\n\r\nWhat was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIII\r\n\r\nIn her furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicately beautiful\r\nthan she had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes. Her manner was more\r\nwinning than she had cared to let it be to me before, and I thought I\r\nsaw Miss Havisham\'s influence in the change.\r\n\r\nWe stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me, and\r\nwhen it was all collected I remembered--having forgotten everything but\r\nherself in the meanwhile--that I knew nothing of her destination.\r\n\r\n"I am going to Richmond," she told me. "Our lesson is, that there are\r\ntwo Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the\r\nSurrey Richmond. The distance is ten miles. I am to have a carriage, and\r\nyou are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges out\r\nof it. O, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I, but to\r\nobey our instructions. We are not free to follow our own devices, you\r\nand I."\r\n\r\nAs she looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an\r\ninner meaning in her words. She said them slightingly, but not with\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\n"A carriage will have to be sent for, Estella. Will you rest here a\r\nlittle?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you\r\nare to take care of me the while."\r\n\r\nShe drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a\r\nwaiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen\r\nsuch a thing in his life, to show us a private sitting-room. Upon that,\r\nhe pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clew without which he\r\ncouldn\'t find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of the\r\nestablishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluous\r\narticle, considering the hole\'s proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet,\r\nand somebody\'s pattens. On my objecting to this retreat, he took us into\r\nanother room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a scorched\r\nleaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust. Having looked at this\r\nextinct conflagration and shaken his head, he took my order; which,\r\nproving to be merely, "Some tea for the lady," sent him out of the room\r\nin a very low state of mind.\r\n\r\nI was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong\r\ncombination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that\r\nthe coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising\r\nproprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.\r\nYet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it. I thought that\r\nwith her I could have been happy there for life. (I was not at all happy\r\nthere at the time, observe, and I knew it well.)\r\n\r\n"Where are you going to, at Richmond?" I asked Estella.\r\n\r\n"I am going to live," said she, "at a great expense, with a lady there,\r\nwho has the power--or says she has--of taking me about, and introducing\r\nme, and showing people to me and showing me to people."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose so."\r\n\r\nShe answered so carelessly, that I said, "You speak of yourself as if\r\nyou were some one else."\r\n\r\n"Where did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come," said Estella,\r\nsmiling delightfully, "you must not expect me to go to school to you; I\r\nmust talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?"\r\n\r\n"I live quite pleasantly there; at least--" It appeared to me that I was\r\nlosing a chance.\r\n\r\n"At least?" repeated Estella.\r\n\r\n"As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you."\r\n\r\n"You silly boy," said Estella, quite composedly, "how can you talk such\r\nnonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest of\r\nhis family?"\r\n\r\n"Very superior indeed. He is nobody\'s enemy--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t add but his own," interposed Estella, "for I hate that class of\r\nman. But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite,\r\nI have heard?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure I have every reason to say so."\r\n\r\n"You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people," said\r\nEstella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once\r\ngrave and rallying, "for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and\r\ninsinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you,\r\nwrite letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the torment\r\nand the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realize to yourself\r\nthe hatred those people feel for you."\r\n\r\n"They do me no harm, I hope?"\r\n\r\nInstead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very singular\r\nto me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity. When she left\r\noff--and she had not laughed languidly, but with real enjoyment--I said,\r\nin my diffident way with her,--\r\n\r\n"I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any\r\nharm."\r\n\r\n"No, no you may be sure of that," said Estella. "You may be certain that\r\nI laugh because they fail. O, those people with Miss Havisham, and the\r\ntortures they undergo!" She laughed again, and even now when she had\r\ntold me why, her laughter was very singular to me, for I could not\r\ndoubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion.\r\nI thought there must really be something more here than I knew; she saw\r\nthe thought in my mind, and answered it.\r\n\r\n"It is not easy for even you." said Estella, "to know what satisfaction\r\nit gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of\r\nthe ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were not\r\nbrought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was. You had not\r\nyour little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed\r\nand defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that\r\nis soft and soothing. I had. You did not gradually open your round\r\nchildish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a\r\nwoman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up\r\nin the night. I did."\r\n\r\nIt was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning these\r\nremembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause of\r\nthat look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.\r\n\r\n"Two things I can tell you," said Estella. "First, notwithstanding the\r\nproverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set\r\nyour mind at rest that these people never will--never would, in hundred\r\nyears--impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great\r\nor small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so\r\nbusy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it."\r\n\r\nAs she gave it to me playfully,--for her darker mood had been but\r\nMomentary,--I held it and put it to my lips. "You ridiculous boy," said\r\nEstella, "will you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in the\r\nsame spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?"\r\n\r\n"What spirit was that?" said I.\r\n\r\n"I must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and\r\nplotters."\r\n\r\n"If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?"\r\n\r\n"You should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if you\r\nlike."\r\n\r\nI leaned down, and her calm face was like a statue\'s. "Now," said\r\nEstella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, "you are to take\r\ncare that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond."\r\n\r\nHer reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon\r\nus, and we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our\r\nintercourse did give me pain. Whatever her tone with me happened to be,\r\nI could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on\r\nagainst trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand times? So it\r\nalways was.\r\n\r\nI rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clew,\r\nbrought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of\r\ntea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and\r\nforks (including carvers), spoons (various), saltcellars, a meek little\r\nmuffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover,\r\nMoses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of\r\nparsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof impressions of\r\nthe bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread, and\r\nultimately a fat family urn; which the waiter staggered in with,\r\nexpressing in his countenance burden and suffering. After a prolonged\r\nabsence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length came back with\r\na casket of precious appearance containing twigs. These I steeped in hot\r\nwater, and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of I\r\ndon\'t know what for Estella.\r\n\r\nThe bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten,\r\nand the chambermaid taken into consideration,--in a word, the whole\r\nhouse bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella\'s purse\r\nmuch lightened,--we got into our post-coach and drove away. Turning into\r\nCheapside and rattling up Newgate Street, we were soon under the walls\r\nof which I was so ashamed.\r\n\r\n"What place is that?" Estella asked me.\r\n\r\nI made a foolish pretence of not at first recognizing it, and then\r\ntold her. As she looked at it, and drew in her head again,\r\nmurmuring, "Wretches!" I would not have confessed to my visit for any\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Jaggers," said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else,\r\n"has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place\r\nthan any man in London."\r\n\r\n"He is more in the secrets of every place, I think," said Estella, in a\r\nlow voice.\r\n\r\n"You have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"I have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since\r\nI can remember. But I know him no better now, than I did before I could\r\nspeak plainly. What is your own experience of him? Do you advance with\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"Once habituated to his distrustful manner," said I, "I have done very\r\nwell."\r\n\r\n"Are you intimate?"\r\n\r\n"I have dined with him at his private house."\r\n\r\n"I fancy," said Estella, shrinking "that must be a curious place."\r\n\r\n"It is a curious place."\r\n\r\nI should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with\r\nher; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe\r\nthe dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden\r\nglare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive\r\nwith that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out of\r\nit, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in lightning.\r\n\r\nSo we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by\r\nwhich we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this\r\nside of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to her, she\r\ntold me, for she had never left Miss Havisham\'s neighborhood until she\r\nhad gone to France, and she had merely passed through London then in\r\ngoing and returning. I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her\r\nwhile she remained here? To that she emphatically said "God forbid!" and\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me;\r\nthat she made herself winning, and would have won me even if the task\r\nhad needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for even if she had\r\nnot taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should have\r\nfelt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do\r\nit, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to crush\r\nit and throw it away.\r\n\r\nWhen we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr. Matthew\r\nPocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I\r\nhoped I should see her sometimes.\r\n\r\n"O yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you\r\nare to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned."\r\n\r\nI inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of?\r\n\r\n"No; there are only two; mother and daughter. The mother is a lady of\r\nsome station, though not averse to increasing her income."\r\n\r\n"I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon."\r\n\r\n"It is a part of Miss Havisham\'s plans for me, Pip," said Estella, with\r\na sigh, as if she were tired; "I am to write to her constantly and see\r\nher regularly and report how I go on,--I and the jewels,--for they are\r\nnearly all mine now."\r\n\r\nIt was the first time she had ever called me by my name. Of course she\r\ndid so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.\r\n\r\nWe came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a house\r\nby the green,--a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches,\r\nembroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had their\r\ncourt days many a time. Some ancient trees before the house were still\r\ncut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and\r\nstiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession of\r\nthe dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go the\r\nsilent way of the rest.\r\n\r\nA bell with an old voice--which I dare say in its time had often said\r\nto the house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hilted\r\nsword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire--sounded\r\ngravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-colored maids came fluttering\r\nout to receive Estella. The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and she\r\ngave me her hand and a smile, and said good night, and was absorbed\r\nlikewise. And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I\r\nshould be if I lived there with her, and knowing that I never was happy\r\nwith her, but always miserable.\r\n\r\nI got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got in\r\nwith a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache. At our\r\nown door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party\r\nescorted by her little lover; and I envied her little lover, in spite of\r\nhis being subject to Flopson.\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket was out lecturing; for, he was a most delightful lecturer on\r\ndomestic economy, and his treatises on the management of children and\r\nservants were considered the very best text-books on those themes. But\r\nMrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account of\r\nthe baby\'s having been accommodated with a needle-case to keep him quiet\r\nduring the unaccountable absence (with a relative in the Foot Guards)\r\nof Millers. And more needles were missing than it could be regarded\r\nas quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply\r\nexternally or to take as a tonic.\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical\r\nadvice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a\r\nhighly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heart-ache of begging him\r\nto accept my confidence. But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as she\r\nsat reading her book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a sovereign\r\nremedy for baby, I thought--Well--No, I wouldn\'t.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIV\r\n\r\nAs I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to\r\nnotice their effect upon myself and those around me. Their influence on\r\nmy own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible,\r\nbut I knew very well that it was not all good. I lived in a state of\r\nchronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to Joe. My conscience was not\r\nby any means comfortable about Biddy. When I woke up in the night,--like\r\nCamilla,--I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits, that I should\r\nhave been happier and better if I had never seen Miss Havisham\'s face,\r\nand had risen to manhood content to be partners with Joe in the honest\r\nold forge. Many a time of an evening, when I sat alone looking at the\r\nfire, I thought, after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the\r\nkitchen fire at home.\r\n\r\nYet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of\r\nmind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part\r\nin its production. That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations,\r\nand yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to my\r\nsatisfaction that I should have done much better. Now, concerning the\r\ninfluence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and so\r\nI perceived--though dimly enough perhaps--that it was not beneficial\r\nto anybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert.\r\nMy lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not\r\nafford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and disturbed his peace\r\nwith anxieties and regrets. I was not at all remorseful for having\r\nunwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor\r\narts they practised; because such littlenesses were their natural\r\nbent, and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them\r\nslumbering. But Herbert\'s was a very different case, and it often caused\r\nme a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in crowding his\r\nsparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work, and placing\r\nthe Canary-breasted Avenger at his disposal.\r\n\r\nSo now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I began\r\nto contract a quantity of debt. I could hardly begin but Herbert\r\nmust begin too, so he soon followed. At Startop\'s suggestion, we put\r\nourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the Grove:\r\nthe object of which institution I have never divined, if it were not\r\nthat the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to quarrel\r\namong themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause six\r\nwaiters to get drunk on the stairs. I know that these gratifying social\r\nends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and I understood\r\nnothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the\r\nsociety: which ran "Gentlemen, may the present promotion of good feeling\r\never reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove."\r\n\r\nThe Finches spent their money foolishly (the Hotel we dined at was\r\nin Covent Garden), and the first Finch I saw when I had the honor of\r\njoining the Grove was Bentley Drummle, at that time floundering about\r\ntown in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts\r\nat the street corners. Occasionally, he shot himself out of his equipage\r\nheadforemost over the apron; and I saw him on one occasion deliver\r\nhimself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way--like coals.\r\nBut here I anticipate a little, for I was not a Finch, and could not be,\r\naccording to the sacred laws of the society, until I came of age.\r\n\r\nIn my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken\r\nHerbert\'s expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could make\r\nno such proposal to him. So he got into difficulties in every direction,\r\nand continued to look about him. When we gradually fell into keeping\r\nlate hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about him with a\r\ndesponding eye at breakfast-time; that he began to look about him more\r\nhopefully about mid-day; that he drooped when he came into dinner;\r\nthat he seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather clearly, after\r\ndinner; that he all but realized Capital towards midnight; and that at\r\nabout two o\'clock in the morning, he became so deeply despondent again\r\nas to talk of buying a rifle and going to America, with a general\r\npurpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune.\r\n\r\nI was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at\r\nHammersmith I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by. Herbert\r\nwould often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those\r\nseasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that\r\nthe opening he was looking for, had not appeared yet. But in the general\r\ntumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere, was\r\na thing to transact itself somehow. In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew\r\ngrayer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the\r\nhair. While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool, read\r\nher book of dignities, lost her pocket-handkerchief, told us about her\r\ngrandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting it into\r\nbed whenever it attracted her notice.\r\n\r\nAs I am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing\r\nmy way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at once completing\r\nthe description of our usual manners and customs at Barnard\'s Inn.\r\n\r\nWe spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people\r\ncould make up their minds to give us. We were always more or less\r\nmiserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition.\r\nThere was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying\r\nourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did. To the best of my\r\nbelief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look\r\nabout him. I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which\r\nhe consorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an\r\nalmanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I\r\never saw him do anything else but look about him. If we all did what\r\nwe undertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a\r\nRepublic of the Virtues. He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except\r\nat a certain hour of every afternoon to "go to Lloyd\'s"--in observance\r\nof a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think. He never did anything\r\nelse in connection with Lloyd\'s that I could find out, except come back\r\nagain. When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positively\r\nmust find an opening, he would go on \'Change at a busy time, and walk in\r\nand out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the assembled\r\nmagnates. "For," says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on one\r\nof those special occasions, "I find the truth to be, Handel, that an\r\nopening won\'t come to one, but one must go to it,--so I have been."\r\n\r\nIf we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated\r\none another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers beyond\r\nexpression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the\r\nsight of the Avenger\'s livery; which had a more expensive and a\r\nless remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the\r\nfour-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into debt, breakfast\r\nbecame a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at\r\nbreakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, "not\r\nunwholly unconnected," as my local paper might put it, "with jewelery,"\r\nI went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake\r\nhim off his feet,--so that he was actually in the air, like a booted\r\nCupid,--for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.\r\n\r\nAt certain times--meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our\r\nhumor--I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery,--\r\n\r\n"My dear Herbert, we are getting on badly."\r\n\r\n"My dear Handel," Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, "if you will\r\nbelieve me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange coincidence."\r\n\r\n"Then, Herbert," I would respond, "let us look into our affairs."\r\n\r\nWe always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for\r\nthis purpose. I always thought this was business, this was the way to\r\nconfront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And\r\nI know Herbert thought so too.\r\n\r\nWe ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of\r\nsomething similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds might\r\nbe fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the mark.\r\nDinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of ink, and\r\na goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there was something\r\nvery comfortable in having plenty of stationery.\r\n\r\nI would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in a\r\nneat hand, the heading, "Memorandum of Pip\'s debts"; with Barnard\'s Inn\r\nand the date very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheet of\r\npaper, and write across it with similar formalities, "Memorandum of\r\nHerbert\'s debts."\r\n\r\nEach of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side,\r\nwhich had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half\r\nburnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and\r\notherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly,\r\ninsomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this\r\nedifying business proceeding and actually paying the money. In point of\r\nmeritorious character, the two things seemed about equal.\r\n\r\nWhen we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on?\r\nHerbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful\r\nmanner at the sight of his accumulating figures.\r\n\r\n"They are mounting up, Handel," Herbert would say; "upon my life, they\r\nare mounting up."\r\n\r\n"Be firm, Herbert," I would retort, plying my own pen with great\r\nassiduity. "Look the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare\r\nthem out of countenance."\r\n\r\n"So I would, Handel, only they are staring me out of countenance."\r\n\r\nHowever, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would\r\nfall to work again. After a time he would give up once more, on the plea\r\nthat he had not got Cobbs\'s bill, or Lobbs\'s, or Nobbs\'s, as the case\r\nmight be.\r\n\r\n"Then, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it\r\ndown."\r\n\r\n"What a fellow of resource you are!" my friend would reply, with\r\nadmiration. "Really your business powers are very remarkable."\r\n\r\nI thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions,\r\nthe reputation of a first-rate man of business,--prompt, decisive,\r\nenergetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities\r\ndown upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My\r\nself-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.\r\nWhen I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,\r\ndocketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical\r\nbundle. Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had not my\r\nadministrative genius), and felt that I had brought his affairs into a\r\nfocus for him.\r\n\r\nMy business habits had one other bright feature, which I called "leaving\r\na Margin." For example; supposing Herbert\'s debts to be one hundred and\r\nsixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, "Leave a margin, and\r\nput them down at two hundred." Or, supposing my own to be four times as\r\nmuch, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven hundred. I had\r\nthe highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin, but I am bound\r\nto acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have been an expensive\r\ndevice. For, we always ran into new debt immediately, to the full extent\r\nof the margin, and sometimes, in the sense of freedom and solvency it\r\nimparted, got pretty far on into another margin.\r\n\r\nBut there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on these\r\nexaminations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirable\r\nopinion of myself. Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert\'s\r\ncompliments, I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the\r\ntable before me among the stationary, and feel like a Bank of some sort,\r\nrather than a private individual.\r\n\r\nWe shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we might\r\nnot be interrupted. I had fallen into my serene state one evening, when\r\nwe heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door, and fall on\r\nthe ground. "It\'s for you, Handel," said Herbert, going out and coming\r\nback with it, "and I hope there is nothing the matter." This was in\r\nallusion to its heavy black seal and border.\r\n\r\nThe letter was signed Trabb & Co., and its contents were simply, that\r\nI was an honored sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J.\r\nGargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past six\r\nin the evening, and that my attendance was requested at the interment on\r\nMonday next at three o\'clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXV\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and\r\nthe gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of my\r\nsister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. That\r\nthe place could possibly be, without her, was something my mind seemed\r\nunable to compass; and whereas she had seldom or never been in my\r\nthoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming\r\ntowards me in the street, or that she would presently knock at the door.\r\nIn my rooms too, with which she had never been at all associated, there\r\nwas at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the\r\nsound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure, as if she were\r\nstill alive and had been often there.\r\n\r\nWhatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my\r\nsister with much tenderness. But I suppose there is a shock of regret\r\nwhich may exist without much tenderness. Under its influence (and\r\nperhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling) I was seized with\r\na violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had suffered\r\nso much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have revengefully\r\npursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.\r\n\r\nHaving written to Joe, to offer him consolation, and to assure him\r\nthat I would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in\r\nthe curious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the\r\nmorning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the\r\nforge.\r\n\r\nIt was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the times\r\nwhen I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me,\r\nvividly returned. But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that\r\nsoftened even the edge of Tickler. For now, the very breath of the beans\r\nand clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would\r\nbe well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be\r\nsoftened as they thought of me.\r\n\r\nAt last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co. had\r\nput in a funereal execution and taken possession. Two dismally absurd\r\npersons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black\r\nbandage,--as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort\r\nto anybody,--were posted at the front door; and in one of them I\r\nrecognized a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young couple\r\ninto a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of intoxication\r\nrendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck\r\nwith both arms. All the children of the village, and most of the women,\r\nwere admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house\r\nand forge; and as I came up, one of the two warders (the postboy)\r\nknocked at the door,--implying that I was far too much exhausted by\r\ngrief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.\r\n\r\nAnother sable warder (a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for a\r\nwager) opened the door, and showed me into the best parlor. Here, Mr.\r\nTrabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves\r\nup, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity\r\nof black pins. At the moment of my arrival, he had just finished putting\r\nsomebody\'s hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby; so he held\r\nout his hand for mine. But I, misled by the action, and confused by the\r\noccasion, shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection.\r\n\r\nPoor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow\r\nunder his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where,\r\nas chief mourner, he had evidently been stationed by Trabb. When I bent\r\ndown and said to him, "Dear Joe, how are you?" he said, "Pip, old chap,\r\nyou knowed her when she were a fine figure of a--" and clasped my hand\r\nand said no more.\r\n\r\nBiddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietly\r\nhere and there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to Biddy, as\r\nI thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and\r\nthere began to wonder in what part of the house it--she--my sister--was.\r\nThe air of the parlor being faint with the smell of sweet-cake, I looked\r\nabout for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible until one\r\nhad got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum cake upon\r\nit, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and biscuits, and two\r\ndecanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had never seen used\r\nin all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry. Standing at this\r\ntable, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook in a black cloak\r\nand several yards of hatband, who was alternately stuffing himself,\r\nand making obsequious movements to catch my attention. The moment he\r\nsucceeded, he came over to me (breathing sherry and crumbs), and said\r\nin a subdued voice, "May I, dear sir?" and did. I then descried Mr. and\r\nMrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner.\r\nWe were all going to "follow," and were all in course of being tied up\r\nseparately (by Trabb) into ridiculous bundles.\r\n\r\n"Which I meantersay, Pip," Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr.\r\nTrabb called "formed" in the parlor, two and two,--and it was dreadfully\r\nlike a preparation for some grim kind of dance; "which I meantersay,\r\nsir, as I would in preference have carried her to the church myself,\r\nalong with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts\r\nand arms, but it were considered wot the neighbors would look down on\r\nsuch and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect."\r\n\r\n"Pocket-handkerchiefs out, all!" cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a\r\ndepressed business-like voice. "Pocket-handkerchiefs out! We are ready!"\r\n\r\nSo we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our\r\nnoses were bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and\r\nPumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. The remains of my poor sister had been\r\nbrought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of Undertaking\r\nceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a\r\nhorrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole looked like\r\na blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling and blundering along,\r\nunder the guidance of two keepers,--the postboy and his comrade.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and we\r\nwere much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful and\r\nvigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off,\r\nand lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage. At such times\r\nthe more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our\r\nemergence round some corner of expectancy, "Here they come!" "Here they\r\nare!" and we were all but cheered. In this progress I was much annoyed\r\nby the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted all the way\r\nas a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband, and smoothing\r\nmy cloak. My thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of\r\nMr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in\r\nbeing members of so distinguished a procession.\r\n\r\nAnd now the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of the\r\nships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the churchyard,\r\nclose to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of this\r\nparish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above. And there, my sister was\r\nlaid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the\r\nlight wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.\r\n\r\nOf the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing,\r\nI desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that even\r\nwhen those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought\r\nnothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how it fleeth like\r\na shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard him cough a\r\nreservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into\r\nlarge property. When we got back, he had the hardihood to tell me that\r\nhe wished my sister could have known I had done her so much honor, and\r\nto hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the\r\nprice of her death. After that, he drank all the rest of the sherry,\r\nand Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two talked (which I have since\r\nobserved to be customary in such cases) as if they were of quite another\r\nrace from the deceased, and were notoriously immortal. Finally, he went\r\naway with Mr. and Mrs. Hubble,--to make an evening of it, I felt sure,\r\nand to tell the Jolly Bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes\r\nand my earliest benefactor.\r\n\r\nWhen they were all gone, and when Trabb and his men--but not his Boy; I\r\nlooked for him--had crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too,\r\nthe house felt wholesomer. Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a\r\ncold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlor, not in the old\r\nkitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his\r\nknife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great\r\nrestraint upon us. But after dinner, when I made him take his pipe,\r\nand when I had loitered with him about the forge, and when we sat down\r\ntogether on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better. I\r\nnoticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far, as to\r\nmake a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress; in which\r\nthe dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man he was.\r\n\r\nHe was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little\r\nroom, and I was pleased too; for I felt that I had done rather a great\r\nthing in making the request. When the shadows of evening were closing\r\nin, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a\r\nlittle talk.\r\n\r\n"Biddy," said I, "I think you might have written to me about these sad\r\nmatters."\r\n\r\n"Do you, Mr. Pip?" said Biddy. "I should have written if I had thought\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider\r\nthat you ought to have thought that."\r\n\r\n"Do you, Mr. Pip?"\r\n\r\nShe was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with\r\nher, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again. After\r\nlooking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me, I gave up\r\nthat point.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy dear?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! I can\'t do so, Mr. Pip," said Biddy, in a tone of regret but still\r\nof quiet conviction. "I have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I am\r\ngoing to her to-morrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care of Mr.\r\nGargery, together, until he settles down."\r\n\r\n"How are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo--"\r\n\r\n"How am I going to live?" repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary\r\nflush upon her face. "I\'ll tell you, Mr. Pip. I am going to try to get\r\nthe place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here. I can be\r\nwell recommended by all the neighbors, and I hope I can be industrious\r\nand patient, and teach myself while I teach others. You know, Mr. Pip,"\r\npursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face, "the new\r\nschools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you after\r\nthat time, and have had time since then to improve."\r\n\r\n"I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Except in my bad side of human nature," murmured Biddy.\r\n\r\nIt was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud. Well!\r\nI thought I would give up that point too. So, I walked a little further\r\nwith Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.\r\n\r\n"I have not heard the particulars of my sister\'s death, Biddy."\r\n\r\n"They are very slight, poor thing. She had been in one of her bad\r\nstates--though they had got better of late, rather than worse--for four\r\ndays, when she came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, and said\r\nquite plainly, \'Joe.\' As she had never said any word for a long while, I\r\nran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge. She made signs to me that\r\nshe wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted me to put her arms\r\nround his neck. So I put them round his neck, and she laid her head down\r\non his shoulder quite content and satisfied. And so she presently said\r\n\'Joe\' again, and once \'Pardon,\' and once \'Pip.\' And so she never lifted\r\nher head up any more, and it was just an hour later when we laid it down\r\non her own bed, because we found she was gone."\r\n\r\nBiddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that were\r\ncoming out, were blurred in my own sight.\r\n\r\n"Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing."\r\n\r\n"Do you know what is become of Orlick?"\r\n\r\n"I should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the\r\nquarries."\r\n\r\n"Of course you have seen him then?--Why are you looking at that dark\r\ntree in the lane?"\r\n\r\n"I saw him there, on the night she died."\r\n\r\n"That was not the last time either, Biddy?"\r\n\r\n"No; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.--It is of\r\nno use," said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running\r\nout, "you know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, and\r\nhe is gone."\r\n\r\nIt revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by\r\nthis fellow, and I felt inveterate against him. I told her so, and told\r\nher that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of\r\nthat country. By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and she\r\ntold me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,--she\r\ndidn\'t say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she meant,--but ever did\r\nhis duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a\r\ngentle heart.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for him," said I; "and Biddy,\r\nwe must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often down\r\nhere now. I am not going to leave poor Joe alone."\r\n\r\nBiddy said never a single word.\r\n\r\n"Biddy, don\'t you hear me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Pip."\r\n\r\n"Not to mention your calling me Mr. Pip,--which appears to me to be in\r\nbad taste, Biddy,--what do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"What do I mean?" asked Biddy, timidly.\r\n\r\n"Biddy," said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, "I must request\r\nto know what you mean by this?"\r\n\r\n"By this?" said Biddy.\r\n\r\n"Now, don\'t echo," I retorted. "You used not to echo, Biddy."\r\n\r\n"Used not!" said Biddy. "O Mr. Pip! Used!"\r\n\r\nWell! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After another\r\nsilent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.\r\n\r\n"Biddy," said I, "I made a remark respecting my coming down here often,\r\nto see Joe, which you received with a marked silence. Have the goodness,\r\nBiddy, to tell me why."\r\n\r\n"Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?" asked\r\nBiddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under the\r\nstars with a clear and honest eye.\r\n\r\n"O dear me!" said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in\r\ndespair. "This really is a very bad side of human nature! Don\'t say any\r\nmore, if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very much."\r\n\r\nFor which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and\r\nwhen I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of her\r\nas I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the churchyard\r\nand the event of the day. As often as I was restless in the night, and\r\nthat was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an unkindness, what\r\nan injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning I was to go. Early in the morning I was out, and\r\nlooking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge. There\r\nI stood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow of\r\nhealth and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright sun\r\nof the life in store for him were shining on it.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, dear Joe!--No, don\'t wipe it off--for God\'s sake, give me your\r\nblackened hand!--I shall be down soon and often."\r\n\r\n"Never too soon, sir," said Joe, "and never too often, Pip!"\r\n\r\nBiddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk and\r\na crust of bread. "Biddy," said I, when I gave her my hand at parting,\r\n"I am not angry, but I am hurt."\r\n\r\n"No, don\'t be hurt," she pleaded quite pathetically; "let only me be\r\nhurt, if I have been ungenerous."\r\n\r\nOnce more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed to\r\nme, as I suspect they did, that I should not come back, and that Biddy\r\nwas quite right, all I can say is,--they were quite right too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVI\r\n\r\nHerbert and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing our\r\ndebts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like exemplary\r\ntransactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as he has a way of doing;\r\nand I came of age,--in fulfilment of Herbert\'s prediction, that I should\r\ndo so before I knew where I was.\r\n\r\nHerbert himself had come of age eight months before me. As he had\r\nnothing else than his majority to come into, the event did not make a\r\nprofound sensation in Barnard\'s Inn. But we had looked forward to\r\nmy one-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations and\r\nanticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly\r\nhelp saying something definite on that occasion.\r\n\r\nI had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my\r\nbirthday was. On the day before it, I received an official note from\r\nWemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call\r\nupon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day. This convinced\r\nus that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusual\r\nflutter when I repaired to my guardian\'s office, a model of punctuality.\r\n\r\nIn the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and\r\nincidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of\r\ntissue-paper that I liked the look of. But he said nothing respecting\r\nit, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian\'s room. It was November,\r\nand my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against\r\nthe chimney-piece, with his hands under his coattails.\r\n\r\n"Well, Pip," said he, "I must call you Mr. Pip to-day. Congratulations,\r\nMr. Pip."\r\n\r\nWe shook hands,--he was always a remarkably short shaker,--and I thanked\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Take a chair, Mr. Pip," said my guardian.\r\n\r\nAs I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his\r\nboots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time when\r\nI had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the shelf\r\nwere not far from him, and their expression was as if they were making a\r\nstupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.\r\n\r\n"Now my young friend," my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the\r\nbox, "I am going to have a word or two with you."\r\n\r\n"If you please, sir."\r\n\r\n"What do you suppose," said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the\r\nground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,--"what\r\ndo you suppose you are living at the rate of?"\r\n\r\n"At the rate of, sir?"\r\n\r\n"At," repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling,\r\n"the--rate--of?" And then looked all round the room, and paused with his\r\npocket-handkerchief in his hand, half-way to his nose.\r\n\r\nI had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed\r\nany slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly,\r\nI confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply\r\nseemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, "I thought so!" and blew his\r\nnose with an air of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Now, I have asked you a question, my friend," said Mr. Jaggers. "Have\r\nyou anything to ask me?"\r\n\r\n"Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several\r\nquestions, sir; but I remember your prohibition."\r\n\r\n"Ask one," said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n"Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?"\r\n\r\n"No. Ask another."\r\n\r\n"Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?"\r\n\r\n"Waive that, a moment," said Mr. Jaggers, "and ask another."\r\n\r\nI looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from\r\nthe inquiry, "Have-I--anything to receive, sir?" On that, Mr. Jaggers\r\nsaid, triumphantly, "I thought we should come to it!" and called to\r\nWemmick to give him that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed it in,\r\nand disappeared.\r\n\r\n"Now, Mr. Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, "attend, if you please. You have been\r\ndrawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick\'s\r\ncash-book; but you are in debt, of course?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I must say yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"You know you must say yes; don\'t you?" said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t ask you what you owe, because you don\'t know; and if you did\r\nknow, you wouldn\'t tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,"\r\ncried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show\r\nof protesting: "it\'s likely enough that you think you wouldn\'t, but\r\nyou would. You\'ll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this\r\npiece of paper in your hand. You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it\r\nand tell me what it is."\r\n\r\n"This is a bank-note," said I, "for five hundred pounds."\r\n\r\n"That is a bank-note," repeated Mr. Jaggers, "for five hundred pounds.\r\nAnd a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?"\r\n\r\n"How could I do otherwise!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! But answer the question," said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly."\r\n\r\n"You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that\r\nhandsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this\r\nday, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome\r\nsum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until the\r\ndonor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take your money\r\naffairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from Wemmick\r\none hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are in\r\ncommunication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mere\r\nagent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my\r\ninstructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but\r\nI am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits."\r\n\r\nI was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great\r\nliberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. "I am\r\nnot paid, Pip," said he, coolly, "to carry your words to any one;" and\r\nthen gathered up his coat-tails, as he had gathered up the subject, and\r\nstood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, I hinted,--\r\n\r\n"There was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me to\r\nwaive for a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?"\r\n\r\n"What is it?" said he.\r\n\r\nI might have known that he would never help me out; but it took me aback\r\nto have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new. "Is it\r\nlikely," I said, after hesitating, "that my patron, the fountain-head\r\nyou have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon--" there I delicately\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n"Will soon what?" asked Mr. Jaggers. "That\'s no question as it stands,\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"Will soon come to London," said I, after casting about for a precise\r\nform of words, "or summon me anywhere else?"\r\n\r\n"Now, here," replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with\r\nhis dark deep-set eyes, "we must revert to the evening when we first\r\nencountered one another in your village. What did I tell you then, Pip?"\r\n\r\n"You told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that person\r\nappeared."\r\n\r\n"Just so," said Mr. Jaggers, "that\'s my answer."\r\n\r\nAs we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my\r\nstrong desire to get something out of him. And as I felt that it came\r\nquicker, and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker, I felt that I\r\nhad less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?"\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers shook his head,--not in negativing the question, but in\r\naltogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer\r\nit,--and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when\r\nmy eyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in their\r\nsuspended attention, and were going to sneeze.\r\n\r\n"Come!" said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the backs\r\nof his warmed hands, "I\'ll be plain with you, my friend Pip. That\'s a\r\nquestion I must not be asked. You\'ll understand that better, when I tell\r\nyou it\'s a question that might compromise me. Come! I\'ll go a little\r\nfurther with you; I\'ll say something more."\r\n\r\nHe bent down so low to frown at his boots, that he was able to rub the\r\ncalves of his legs in the pause he made.\r\n\r\n"When that person discloses," said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself,\r\n"you and that person will settle your own affairs. When that person\r\ndiscloses, my part in this business will cease and determine. When that\r\nperson discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anything about\r\nit. And that\'s all I have got to say."\r\n\r\nWe looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked\r\nthoughtfully at the floor. From this last speech I derived the notion\r\nthat Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken him\r\ninto her confidence as to her designing me for Estella; that he resented\r\nthis, and felt a jealousy about it; or that he really did object to\r\nthat scheme, and would have nothing to do with it. When I raised my eyes\r\nagain, I found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all the time, and\r\nwas doing so still.\r\n\r\n"If that is all you have to say, sir," I remarked, "there can be nothing\r\nleft for me to say."\r\n\r\nHe nodded assent, and pulled out his thief-dreaded watch, and asked me\r\nwhere I was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert.\r\nAs a necessary sequence, I asked him if he would favor us with his\r\ncompany, and he promptly accepted the invitation. But he insisted on\r\nwalking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparation\r\nfor him, and first he had a letter or two to write, and (of course) had\r\nhis hands to wash. So I said I would go into the outer office and talk\r\nto Wemmick.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket,\r\na thought had come into my head which had been often there before;\r\nand it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise with\r\nconcerning such thought.\r\n\r\nHe had already locked up his safe, and made preparations for going home.\r\nHe had left his desk, brought out his two greasy office candlesticks and\r\nstood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door, ready to\r\nbe extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put his hat and great-coat\r\nready, and was beating himself all over the chest with his safe-key, as\r\nan athletic exercise after business.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Wemmick," said I, "I want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous\r\nto serve a friend."\r\n\r\nWemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinion\r\nwere dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.\r\n\r\n"This friend," I pursued, "is trying to get on in commercial life,\r\nbut has no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a\r\nbeginning. Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning."\r\n\r\n"With money down?" said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.\r\n\r\n"With some money down," I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot across\r\nme of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home--"with some money down,\r\nand perhaps some anticipation of my expectations."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Pip," said Wemmick, "I should like just to run over with you on my\r\nfingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high\r\nas Chelsea Reach. Let\'s see; there\'s London, one; Southwark, two;\r\nBlackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six."\r\nHe had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his\r\nsafe-key on the palm of his hand. "There\'s as many as six, you see, to\r\nchoose from."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand you," said I.\r\n\r\n"Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip," returned Wemmick, "and take a walk upon\r\nyour bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch\r\nof your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and\r\nyou may know the end of it too,--but it\'s a less pleasant and profitable\r\nend."\r\n\r\nI could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide after\r\nsaying this.\r\n\r\n"This is very discouraging," said I.\r\n\r\n"Meant to be so," said Wemmick.\r\n\r\n"Then is it your opinion," I inquired, with some little indignation,\r\n"that a man should never--"\r\n\r\n"--Invest portable property in a friend?" said Wemmick. "Certainly\r\nhe should not. Unless he wants to get rid of the friend,--and then it\r\nbecomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid\r\nof him."\r\n\r\n"And that," said I, "is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?"\r\n\r\n"That," he returned, "is my deliberate opinion in this office."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole\r\nhere; "but would that be your opinion at Walworth?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Pip," he replied, with gravity, "Walworth is one place, and this\r\noffice is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is\r\nanother. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments\r\nmust be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken\r\nin this office."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said I, much relieved, "then I shall look you up at\r\nWalworth, you may depend upon it."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Pip," he returned, "you will be welcome there, in a private and\r\npersonal capacity."\r\n\r\nWe had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my guardian\'s\r\nears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared in his doorway,\r\ntowelling his hands, Wemmick got on his great-coat and stood by to snuff\r\nout the candles. We all three went into the street together, and from\r\nthe door-step Wemmick turned his way, and Mr. Jaggers and I turned ours.\r\n\r\nI could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers\r\nhad had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or\r\na Somebody, to unbend his brows a little. It was an uncomfortable\r\nconsideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all\r\nseemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he\r\nmade of it. He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than\r\nWemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to\r\ndinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy, because,\r\nafter he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes fixed on the\r\nfire, that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the\r\ndetails of it, he felt so dejected and guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVII\r\n\r\nDeeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick\'s Walworth\r\nsentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage\r\nto the Castle. On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union\r\nJack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of\r\ndefiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most\r\npacific manner by the Aged.\r\n\r\n"My son, sir," said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, "rather\r\nhad it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left word\r\nthat he would soon be home from his afternoon\'s walk. He is very regular\r\nin his walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my son."\r\n\r\nI nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and\r\nwe went in and sat down by the fireside.\r\n\r\n"You made acquaintance with my son, sir," said the old man, in his\r\nchirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, "at his office, I\r\nexpect?" I nodded. "Hah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at\r\nhis business, sir?" I nodded hard. "Yes; so they tell me. His business\r\nis the Law?" I nodded harder. "Which makes it more surprising in my\r\nson," said the old man, "for he was not brought up to the Law, but to\r\nthe Wine-Coopering."\r\n\r\nCurious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the\r\nreputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him. He threw me into\r\nthe greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very\r\nsprightly manner, "No, to be sure; you\'re right." And to this hour I\r\nhave not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought I\r\nhad made.\r\n\r\nAs I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making\r\nsome other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether his own\r\ncalling in life had been "the Wine-Coopering." By dint of straining that\r\nterm out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the\r\nchest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making my meaning\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n"No," said the old gentleman; "the warehousing, the warehousing. First,\r\nover yonder;" he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he\r\nintended to refer me to Liverpool; "and then in the City of London here.\r\nHowever, having an infirmity--for I am hard of hearing, sir--"\r\n\r\nI expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.\r\n\r\n"--Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he\r\nwent into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little and little\r\nmade out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning to what you\r\nsaid, you know," pursued the old man, again laughing heartily, "what I\r\nsay is, No to be sure; you\'re right."\r\n\r\nI was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled\r\nme to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this\r\nimaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall\r\non one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little\r\nwooden flap with "JOHN" upon it. The old man, following my eyes, cried\r\nwith great triumph, "My son\'s come home!" and we both went out to the\r\ndrawbridge.\r\n\r\nIt was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the\r\nother side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with\r\nthe greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge,\r\nthat I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet until Wemmick had\r\ncome across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins; a lady by whom he\r\nwas accompanied.\r\n\r\nMiss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her escort, in\r\nthe post-office branch of the service. She might have been some two or\r\nthree years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessed\r\nof portable property. The cut of her dress from the waist upward, both\r\nbefore and behind, made her figure very like a boy\'s kite; and I might\r\nhave pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her gloves a\r\nlittle too intensely green. But she seemed to be a good sort of fellow,\r\nand showed a high regard for the Aged. I was not long in discovering\r\nthat she was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on our going in,\r\nand my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for announcing\r\nhimself to the Aged, he begged me to give my attention for a moment to\r\nthe other side of the chimney, and disappeared. Presently another click\r\ncame, and another little door tumbled open with "Miss Skiffins" on it;\r\nthen Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; then Miss Skiffins\r\nand John both tumbled open together, and finally shut up together. On\r\nWemmick\'s return from working these mechanical appliances, I expressed\r\nthe great admiration with which I regarded them, and he said, "Well, you\r\nknow, they\'re both pleasant and useful to the Aged. And by George, sir,\r\nit\'s a thing worth mentioning, that of all the people who come to\r\nthis gate, the secret of those pulls is only known to the Aged, Miss\r\nSkiffins, and me!"\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Wemmick made them," added Miss Skiffins, "with his own hands\r\nout of his own head."\r\n\r\nWhile Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet (she retained her green\r\ngloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was\r\ncompany), Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property,\r\nand see how the island looked in wintertime. Thinking that he did this\r\nto give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, I seized\r\nthe opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.\r\n\r\nHaving thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I\r\nhad never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in\r\nbehalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how\r\nwe had fought. I glanced at Herbert\'s home, and at his character, and\r\nat his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for;\r\nthose, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had\r\nderived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I\r\nconfessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might\r\nhave done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham\r\nin the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the possibility\r\nof my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the certainty of\r\nhis possessing a generous soul, and being far above any mean distrusts,\r\nretaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I told Wemmick),\r\nand because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a great\r\naffection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays\r\nupon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick\'s experience and\r\nknowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my resources to\r\nhelp Herbert to some present income,--say of a hundred a year, to keep\r\nhim in good hope and heart,--and gradually to buy him on to some small\r\npartnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to understand that my help\r\nmust always be rendered without Herbert\'s knowledge or suspicion, and\r\nthat there was no one else in the world with whom I could advise. I\r\nwound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder, and saying, "I can\'t help\r\nconfiding in you, though I know it must be troublesome to you; but that\r\nis your fault, in having ever brought me here."\r\n\r\nWemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of\r\nstart, "Well you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing. This is\r\ndevilish good of you."\r\n\r\n"Say you\'ll help me to be good then," said I.\r\n\r\n"Ecod," replied Wemmick, shaking his head, "that\'s not my trade."\r\n\r\n"Nor is this your trading-place," said I.\r\n\r\n"You are right," he returned. "You hit the nail on the head. Mr. Pip,\r\nI\'ll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may be\r\ndone by degrees. Skiffins (that\'s her brother) is an accountant and\r\nagent. I\'ll look him up and go to work for you."\r\n\r\n"I thank you ten thousand times."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary," said he, "I thank you, for though we are strictly in\r\nour private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there\r\nare Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away."\r\n\r\nAfter a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned into\r\nthe Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea. The responsible\r\nduty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and that excellent\r\nold gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger\r\nof melting his eyes. It was no nominal meal that we were going to make,\r\nbut a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared such a hay-stack of buttered\r\ntoast, that I could scarcely see him over it as it simmered on an iron\r\nstand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss Skiffins brewed such a jorum\r\nof tea, that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited, and\r\nrepeatedly expressed his desire to participate in the entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right\r\nmoment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth\r\nas if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing disturbed\r\nthe tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of\r\nJohn and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic\r\ninfirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I got used\r\nto it. I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss Skiffins\'s\r\narrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; and I rather\r\nsuspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the profile of an\r\nundesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon, was a\r\npiece of portable property that had been given her by Wemmick.\r\n\r\nWe ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was\r\ndelightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it. The Aged\r\nespecially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage\r\ntribe, just oiled. After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins--in the\r\nabsence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of\r\nher family on Sunday afternoons--washed up the tea-things, in a trifling\r\nlady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us. Then, she put on\r\nher gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, "Now,\r\nAged Parent, tip us the paper."\r\n\r\nWemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, that this\r\nwas according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman infinite\r\nsatisfaction to read the news aloud. "I won\'t offer an apology," said\r\nWemmick, "for he isn\'t capable of many pleasures--are you, Aged P.?"\r\n\r\n"All right, John, all right," returned the old man, seeing himself\r\nspoken to.\r\n\r\n"Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper,"\r\nsaid Wemmick, "and he\'ll be as happy as a king. We are all attention,\r\nAged One."\r\n\r\n"All right, John, all right!" returned the cheerful old man, so busy and\r\nso pleased, that it really was quite charming.\r\n\r\nThe Aged\'s reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle\'s\r\ngreat-aunt\'s, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come\r\nthrough a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was\r\nalways on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into\r\nthem, he required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was\r\nequally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,\r\nquite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he looked at us, we\r\nall expressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he\r\nresumed again.\r\n\r\nAs Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a shadowy\r\ncorner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr. Wemmick\'s mouth,\r\npowerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round\r\nMiss Skiffins\'s waist. In course of time I saw his hand appear on the\r\nother side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment Miss Skiffins neatly\r\nstopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm again as if it were\r\nan article of dress, and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the\r\ntable before her. Miss Skiffins\'s composure while she did this was one\r\nof the most remarkable sights I have ever seen, and if I could have\r\nthought the act consistent with abstraction of mind, I should have\r\ndeemed that Miss Skiffins performed it mechanically.\r\n\r\nBy and by, I noticed Wemmick\'s arm beginning to disappear again, and\r\ngradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to\r\nwiden again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite\r\nenthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side\r\nof Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness\r\nof a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid\r\nit on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am\r\njustified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged\'s reading,\r\nWemmick\'s arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to\r\nit by Miss Skiffins.\r\n\r\nAt last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. This was the time\r\nfor Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a\r\nblack bottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical\r\ndignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of these\r\nappliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, who\r\nwas soon awake again. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she and\r\nWemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better than to offer to\r\nsee Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had best\r\ngo first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and having\r\npassed a pleasant evening.\r\n\r\nBefore a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth,\r\nstating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter\r\nappertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would\r\nbe glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I went out\r\nto Walworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by\r\nappointment in the City several times, but never held any communication\r\nwith him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was,\r\nthat we found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long\r\nestablished in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted\r\ncapital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner.\r\nBetween him and me, secret articles were signed of which Herbert was the\r\nsubject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds down, and engaged\r\nfor sundry other payments: some, to fall due at certain dates out of my\r\nincome: some, contingent on my coming into my property. Miss Skiffins\'s\r\nbrother conducted the negotiation. Wemmick pervaded it throughout, but\r\nnever appeared in it.\r\n\r\nThe whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the\r\nleast suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget the radiant\r\nface with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as a mighty\r\npiece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker (the young\r\nmerchant\'s name), and of Clarriker\'s having shown an extraordinary\r\ninclination towards him, and of his belief that the opening had come at\r\nlast. Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter, he\r\nmust have thought me a more and more affectionate friend, for I had the\r\ngreatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when I saw him so\r\nhappy. At length, the thing being done, and he having that day entered\r\nClarriker\'s House, and he having talked to me for a whole evening in a\r\nflush of pleasure and success, I did really cry in good earnest when\r\nI went to bed, to think that my expectations had done some good to\r\nsomebody.\r\n\r\nA great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my\r\nview. But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all\r\nthe changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella. It is not\r\nmuch to give to the theme that so long filled my heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVIII\r\n\r\nIf that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to\r\nbe haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my ghost. O\r\nthe many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within\r\nme haunted that house when Estella lived there! Let my body be where it\r\nwould, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about that\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was a\r\nwidow, with one daughter several years older than Estella. The mother\r\nlooked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother\'s complexion was\r\npink, and the daughter\'s was yellow; the mother set up for frivolity,\r\nand the daughter for theology. They were in what is called a good\r\nposition, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people. Little,\r\nif any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, but the\r\nunderstanding was established that they were necessary to her, and\r\nthat she was necessary to them. Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of Miss\r\nHavisham\'s before the time of her seclusion.\r\n\r\nIn Mrs. Brandley\'s house and out of Mrs. Brandley\'s house, I suffered\r\nevery kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me. The\r\nnature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms of familiarity\r\nwithout placing me on terms of favor, conduced to my distraction.\r\nShe made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turned the very\r\nfamiliarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant\r\nslight on my devotion to her. If I had been her secretary, steward,\r\nhalf-brother, poor relation,--if I had been a younger brother of her\r\nappointed husband,--I could not have seemed to myself further from my\r\nhopes when I was nearest to her. The privilege of calling her by her\r\nname and hearing her call me by mine became, under the circumstances\r\nan aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likely that it almost\r\nmaddened her other lovers, I know too certainly that it almost maddened\r\nme.\r\n\r\nShe had admirers without end. No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of\r\nevery one who went near her; but there were more than enough of them\r\nwithout that.\r\n\r\nI saw her often at Richmond, I heard of her often in town, and I used\r\noften to take her and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics,\r\nf\xc3\xaate days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures,\r\nthrough which I pursued her,--and they were all miseries to me. I never\r\nhad one hour\'s happiness in her society, and yet my mind all round the\r\nfour-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with me\r\nunto death.\r\n\r\nThroughout this part of our intercourse,--and it lasted, as will\r\npresently be seen, for what I then thought a long time,--she habitually\r\nreverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced\r\nupon us. There were other times when she would come to a sudden check in\r\nthis tone and in all her many tones, and would seem to pity me.\r\n\r\n"Pip, Pip," she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat\r\napart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; "will you never\r\ntake warning?"\r\n\r\n"Of what?"\r\n\r\n"Of me."\r\n\r\n"Warning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?"\r\n\r\n"Do I mean! If you don\'t know what I mean, you are blind."\r\n\r\nI should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for the\r\nreason that I always was restrained--and this was not the least of my\r\nmiseries--by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her,\r\nwhen she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham. My\r\ndread always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy\r\ndisadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious\r\nstruggle in her bosom.\r\n\r\n"At any rate," said I, "I have no warning given me just now, for you\r\nwrote to me to come to you, this time."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true," said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always\r\nchilled me.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she went on\r\nto say:--\r\n\r\n"The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day\r\nat Satis. You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will. She\r\nwould rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid,\r\nfor she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people. Can\r\nyou take me?"\r\n\r\n"Can I take you, Estella!"\r\n\r\n"You can then? The day after to-morrow, if you please. You are to pay\r\nall charges out of my purse, You hear the condition of your going?"\r\n\r\n"And must obey," said I.\r\n\r\nThis was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others\r\nlike it; Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as seen\r\nher handwriting. We went down on the next day but one, and we found her\r\nin the room where I had first beheld her, and it is needless to add that\r\nthere was no change in Satis House.\r\n\r\nShe was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when\r\nI last saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was\r\nsomething positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces.\r\nShe hung upon Estella\'s beauty, hung upon her words, hung upon her\r\ngestures, and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked at\r\nher, as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had reared.\r\n\r\nFrom Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to\r\npry into my heart and probe its wounds. "How does she use you, Pip; how\r\ndoes she use you?" she asked me again, with her witch-like eagerness,\r\neven in Estella\'s hearing. But, when we sat by her flickering fire\r\nat night, she was most weird; for then, keeping Estella\'s hand drawn\r\nthrough her arm and clutched in her own hand, she extorted from her,\r\nby dint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular\r\nletters, the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated;\r\nand as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind\r\nmortally hurt and diseased, she sat with her other hand on her crutch\r\nstick, and her chin on that, and her wan bright eyes glaring at me, a\r\nvery spectre.\r\n\r\nI saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of\r\ndependence and even of degradation that it awakened,--I saw in this that\r\nEstella was set to wreak Miss Havisham\'s revenge on men, and that she\r\nwas not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term. I saw\r\nin this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me. Sending her\r\nout to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with\r\nthe malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers,\r\nand that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I saw in\r\nthis that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even while\r\nthe prize was reserved for me. I saw in this the reason for my being\r\nstaved off so long and the reason for my late guardian\'s declining to\r\ncommit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme. In a word, I\r\nsaw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and there before my eyes,\r\nand always had had her before my eyes; and I saw in this, the distinct\r\nshadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden\r\nfrom the sun.\r\n\r\nThe candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on\r\nthe wall. They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the steady\r\ndulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As I looked\r\nround at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the stopped\r\nclock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and\r\nthe ground, and at her own awful figure with its ghostly reflection\r\nthrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I saw in\r\neverything the construction that my mind had come to, repeated and\r\nthrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great room across the\r\nlanding where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as it were, in\r\nthe falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in the crawlings of the\r\nspiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as they betook their\r\nlittle quickened hearts behind the panels, and in the gropings and\r\npausings of the beetles on the floor.\r\n\r\nIt happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose\r\nbetween Estella and Miss Havisham. It was the first time I had ever seen\r\nthem opposed.\r\n\r\nWe were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham\r\nstill had Estella\'s arm drawn through her own, and still clutched\r\nEstella\'s hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.\r\nShe had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had rather\r\nendured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.\r\n\r\n"What!" said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her, "are you tired\r\nof me?"\r\n\r\n"Only a little tired of myself," replied Estella, disengaging her arm,\r\nand moving to the great chimney-piece, where she stood looking down at\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n"Speak the truth, you ingrate!" cried Miss Havisham, passionately\r\nstriking her stick upon the floor; "you are tired of me."\r\n\r\nEstella looked at her with perfect composure, and again looked down\r\nat the fire. Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a\r\nself-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that was\r\nalmost cruel.\r\n\r\n"You stock and stone!" exclaimed Miss Havisham. "You cold, cold heart!"\r\n\r\n"What?" said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as she\r\nleaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; "do you\r\nreproach me for being cold? You?"\r\n\r\n"Are you not?" was the fierce retort.\r\n\r\n"You should know," said Estella. "I am what you have made me. Take\r\nall the praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the\r\nfailure; in short, take me."\r\n\r\n"O, look at her, look at her!" cried Miss Havisham, bitterly; "Look at\r\nher so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared! Where I\r\ntook her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its\r\nstabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her!"\r\n\r\n"At least I was no party to the compact," said Estella, "for if I could\r\nwalk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do. But what\r\nwould you have? You have been very good to me, and I owe everything to\r\nyou. What would you have?"\r\n\r\n"Love," replied the other.\r\n\r\n"You have it."\r\n\r\n"I have not," said Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n"Mother by adoption," retorted Estella, never departing from the easy\r\ngrace of her attitude, never raising her voice as the other did, never\r\nyielding either to anger or tenderness,--"mother by adoption, I have\r\nsaid that I owe everything to you. All I possess is freely yours. All\r\nthat you have given me, is at your command to have again. Beyond that, I\r\nhave nothing. And if you ask me to give you, what you never gave me, my\r\ngratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities."\r\n\r\n"Did I never give her love!" cried Miss Havisham, turning wildly to me.\r\n"Did I never give her a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at all\r\ntimes, and from sharp pain, while she speaks thus to me! Let her call me\r\nmad, let her call me mad!"\r\n\r\n"Why should I call you mad," returned Estella, "I, of all people? Does\r\nany one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I\r\ndo? Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half\r\nas well as I do? I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool\r\nthat is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up\r\ninto your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!"\r\n\r\n"Soon forgotten!" moaned Miss Havisham. "Times soon forgotten!"\r\n\r\n"No, not forgotten," retorted Estella,--"not forgotten, but treasured up\r\nin my memory. When have you found me false to your teaching? When have\r\nyou found me unmindful of your lessons? When have you found me giving\r\nadmission here," she touched her bosom with her hand, "to anything that\r\nyou excluded? Be just to me."\r\n\r\n"So proud, so proud!" moaned Miss Havisham, pushing away her gray hair\r\nwith both her hands.\r\n\r\n"Who taught me to be proud?" returned Estella. "Who praised me when I\r\nlearnt my lesson?"\r\n\r\n"So hard, so hard!" moaned Miss Havisham, with her former action.\r\n\r\n"Who taught me to be hard?" returned Estella. "Who praised me when I\r\nlearnt my lesson?"\r\n\r\n"But to be proud and hard to me!" Miss Havisham quite shrieked, as she\r\nstretched out her arms. "Estella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and hard\r\nto me!"\r\n\r\nEstella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was\r\nnot otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, she looked down at\r\nthe fire again.\r\n\r\n"I cannot think," said Estella, raising her eyes after a silence "why\r\nyou should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation.\r\nI have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes. I have never been\r\nunfaithful to you or your schooling. I have never shown any weakness\r\nthat I can charge myself with."\r\n\r\n"Would it be weakness to return my love?" exclaimed Miss Havisham. "But\r\nyes, yes, she would call it so!"\r\n\r\n"I begin to think," said Estella, in a musing way, after another moment\r\nof calm wonder, "that I almost understand how this comes about. If you\r\nhad brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of\r\nthese rooms, and had never let her know that there was such a thing as\r\nthe daylight by which she had never once seen your face,--if you had\r\ndone that, and then, for a purpose had wanted her to understand the\r\ndaylight and know all about it, you would have been disappointed and\r\nangry?"\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham, with her head in her hands, sat making a low moaning, and\r\nswaying herself on her chair, but gave no answer.\r\n\r\n"Or," said Estella,--"which is a nearer case,--if you had taught her,\r\nfrom the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might,\r\nthat there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her\r\nenemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it had\r\nblighted you and would else blight her;--if you had done this, and then,\r\nfor a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she\r\ncould not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?"\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see her\r\nface), but still made no answer.\r\n\r\n"So," said Estella, "I must be taken as I have been made. The success is\r\nnot mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me."\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor, among\r\nthe faded bridal relics with which it was strewn. I took advantage of\r\nthe moment--I had sought one from the first--to leave the room, after\r\nbeseeching Estella\'s attention to her, with a movement of my hand. When\r\nI left, Estella was yet standing by the great chimney-piece, just as she\r\nhad stood throughout. Miss Havisham\'s gray hair was all adrift upon the\r\nground, among the other bridal wrecks, and was a miserable sight to see.\r\n\r\nIt was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an\r\nhour and more, about the courtyard, and about the brewery, and about\r\nthe ruined garden. When I at last took courage to return to the room, I\r\nfound Estella sitting at Miss Havisham\'s knee, taking up some stitches\r\nin one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, and\r\nof which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old\r\nbanners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals. Afterwards, Estella\r\nand I played at cards, as of yore,--only we were skilful now, and played\r\nFrench games,--and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.\r\n\r\nI lay in that separate building across the courtyard. It was the first\r\ntime I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to\r\ncome near me. A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. She was on this side\r\nof my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind the\r\nhalf-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in the room\r\noverhead, in the room beneath,--everywhere. At last, when the night was\r\nslow to creep on towards two o\'clock, I felt that I absolutely could no\r\nlonger bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I must get up.\r\nI therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out across the yard\r\ninto the long stone passage, designing to gain the outer courtyard and\r\nwalk there for the relief of my mind. But I was no sooner in the passage\r\nthan I extinguished my candle; for I saw Miss Havisham going along it\r\nin a ghostly manner, making a low cry. I followed her at a distance,\r\nand saw her go up the staircase. She carried a bare candle in her hand,\r\nwhich she had probably taken from one of the sconces in her own room,\r\nand was a most unearthly object by its light. Standing at the bottom\r\nof the staircase, I felt the mildewed air of the feast-chamber, without\r\nseeing her open the door, and I heard her walking there, and so across\r\ninto her own room, and so across again into that, never ceasing the low\r\ncry. After a time, I tried in the dark both to get out, and to go back,\r\nbut I could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed\r\nme where to lay my hands. During the whole interval, whenever I went to\r\nthe bottom of the staircase, I heard her footstep, saw her light pass\r\nabove, and heard her ceaseless low cry.\r\n\r\nBefore we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between\r\nher and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and\r\nthere were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance. Nor,\r\ndid Miss Havisham\'s manner towards Estella in anywise change, except\r\nthat I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Bentley\r\nDrummle\'s name upon it; or I would, very gladly.\r\n\r\nOn a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and when\r\ngood feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody\'s agreeing\r\nwith anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to order,\r\nforasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which, according\r\nto the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute\'s turn to\r\ndo that day. I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me while the\r\ndecanters were going round, but as there was no love lost between us,\r\nthat might easily be. What was my indignant surprise when he called upon\r\nthe company to pledge him to "Estella!"\r\n\r\n"Estella who?" said I.\r\n\r\n"Never you mind," retorted Drummle.\r\n\r\n"Estella of where?" said I. "You are bound to say of where." Which he\r\nwas, as a Finch.\r\n\r\n"Of Richmond, gentlemen," said Drummle, putting me out of the question,\r\n"and a peerless beauty."\r\n\r\nMuch he knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot! I\r\nwhispered Herbert.\r\n\r\n"I know that lady," said Herbert, across the table, when the toast had\r\nbeen honored.\r\n\r\n"Do you?" said Drummle.\r\n\r\n"And so do I," I added, with a scarlet face.\r\n\r\n"Do you?" said Drummle. "O, Lord!"\r\n\r\nThis was the only retort--except glass or crockery--that the heavy\r\ncreature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it\r\nas if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place\r\nand said that I could not but regard it as being like the honorable\r\nFinch\'s impudence to come down to that Grove,--we always talked\r\nabout coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of\r\nexpression,--down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew\r\nnothing. Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by\r\nthat? Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew\r\nwhere I was to be found.\r\n\r\nWhether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood,\r\nafter this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The debate\r\nupon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more honorable members\r\ntold six more, during the discussion, that they believed they knew where\r\nthey were to be found. However, it was decided at last (the Grove being\r\na Court of Honor) that if Mr. Drummle would bring never so slight\r\na certificate from the lady, importing that he had the honor of her\r\nacquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret, as a gentleman and a\r\nFinch, for "having been betrayed into a warmth which." Next day was\r\nappointed for the production (lest our honor should take cold from\r\ndelay), and next day Drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in\r\nEstella\'s hand, that she had had the honor of dancing with him several\r\ntimes. This left me no course but to regret that I had been "betrayed\r\ninto a warmth which," and on the whole to repudiate, as untenable, the\r\nidea that I was to be found anywhere. Drummle and I then sat snorting\r\nat one another for an hour, while the Grove engaged in indiscriminate\r\ncontradiction, and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to\r\nhave gone ahead at an amazing rate.\r\n\r\nI tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me. For, I cannot\r\nadequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should\r\nshow any favor to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far below\r\nthe average. To the present moment, I believe it to have been referable\r\nto some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for\r\nher, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to that hound.\r\nNo doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she had favored; but\r\na worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\nIt was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle\r\nhad begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him to do it. A\r\nlittle while, and he was always in pursuit of her, and he and I crossed\r\none another every day. He held on, in a dull persistent way, and Estella\r\nheld him on; now with encouragement, now with discouragement, now almost\r\nflattering him, now openly despising him, now knowing him very well, now\r\nscarcely remembering who he was.\r\n\r\nThe Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in wait,\r\nhowever, and had the patience of his tribe. Added to that, he had a\r\nblockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness,\r\nwhich sometimes did him good service,--almost taking the place of\r\nconcentration and determined purpose. So, the Spider, doggedly watching\r\nEstella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoil\r\nhimself and drop at the right nick of time.\r\n\r\nAt a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond (there used to be Assembly Balls\r\nat most places then), where Estella had outshone all other beauties,\r\nthis blundering Drummle so hung about her, and with so much toleration\r\non her part, that I resolved to speak to her concerning him. I took the\r\nnext opportunity; which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to\r\ntake her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go.\r\nI was with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from such\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n"Are you tired, Estella?"\r\n\r\n"Rather, Pip."\r\n\r\n"You should be."\r\n\r\n"Say rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to\r\nwrite, before I go to sleep."\r\n\r\n"Recounting to-night\'s triumph?" said I. "Surely a very poor one,\r\nEstella."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean? I didn\'t know there had been any."\r\n\r\n"Estella," said I, "do look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is\r\nlooking over here at us."\r\n\r\n"Why should I look at him?" returned Estella, with her eyes on me\r\ninstead. "What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,--to use\r\nyour words,--that I need look at?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you," said I. "For he\r\nhas been hovering about you all night."\r\n\r\n"Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures," replied Estella, with a glance\r\ntowards him, "hover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help it?"\r\n\r\n"No," I returned; "but cannot the Estella help it?"\r\n\r\n"Well!" said she, laughing, after a moment, "perhaps. Yes. Anything you\r\nlike."\r\n\r\n"But, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should\r\nencourage a man so generally despised as Drummle. You know he is\r\ndespised."\r\n\r\n"Well?" said she.\r\n\r\n"You know he is as ungainly within as without. A deficient,\r\nill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow."\r\n\r\n"Well?" said she.\r\n\r\n"You know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous\r\nroll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Well?" said she again; and each time she said it, she opened her lovely\r\neyes the wider.\r\n\r\nTo overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it\r\nfrom her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, "Well! Then, that is why\r\nit makes me wretched."\r\n\r\nNow, if I could have believed that she favored Drummle with any idea of\r\nmaking me-me--wretched, I should have been in better heart about it;\r\nbut in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of the\r\nquestion, that I could believe nothing of the kind.\r\n\r\n"Pip," said Estella, casting her glance over the room, "don\'t be foolish\r\nabout its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, and may be\r\nmeant to have. It\'s not worth discussing."\r\n\r\n"Yes it is," said I, "because I cannot bear that people should say, \'she\r\nthrows away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest in the\r\ncrowd.\'"\r\n\r\n"I can bear it," said Estella.\r\n\r\n"Oh! don\'t be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible."\r\n\r\n"Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!" said Estella, opening\r\nher hands. "And in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a\r\nboor!"\r\n\r\n"There is no doubt you do," said I, something hurriedly, "for I have\r\nseen you give him looks and smiles this very night, such as you never\r\ngive to--me."\r\n\r\n"Do you want me then," said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and\r\nserious, if not angry, look, "to deceive and entrap you?"\r\n\r\n"Do you deceive and entrap him, Estella?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and many others,--all of them but you. Here is Mrs. Brandley. I\'ll\r\nsay no more."\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nAnd now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my\r\nheart, and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass on unhindered,\r\nto the event that had impended over me longer yet; the event that had\r\nbegun to be prepared for, before I knew that the world held Estella,\r\nand in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving its first\r\ndistortions from Miss Havisham\'s wasting hands.\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern story, the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of\r\nstate in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry, the\r\ntunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through\r\nthe leagues of rock, the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof,\r\nthe rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to\r\nthe great iron ring. All being made ready with much labor, and the hour\r\ncome, the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night, and the sharpened\r\naxe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his\r\nhand, and he struck with it, and the rope parted and rushed away, and\r\nthe ceiling fell. So, in my case; all the work, near and afar, that\r\ntended to the end, had been accomplished; and in an instant the blow was\r\nstruck, and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIX\r\n\r\nI was three-and-twenty years of age. Not another word had I heard to\r\nenlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twenty-third\r\nbirthday was a week gone. We had left Barnard\'s Inn more than a year,\r\nand lived in the Temple. Our chambers were in Garden-court, down by the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our original\r\nrelations, though we continued on the best terms. Notwithstanding my\r\ninability to settle to anything,--which I hope arose out of the restless\r\nand incomplete tenure on which I held my means,--I had a taste for\r\nreading, and read regularly so many hours a day. That matter of\r\nHerbert\'s was still progressing, and everything with me was as I have\r\nbrought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter.\r\n\r\nBusiness had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles. I was alone, and\r\nhad a dull sense of being alone. Dispirited and anxious, long hoping\r\nthat to-morrow or next week would clear my way, and long disappointed, I\r\nsadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend.\r\n\r\nIt was wretched weather; stormy and wet, stormy and wet; and mud, mud,\r\nmud, deep in all the streets. Day after day, a vast heavy veil had been\r\ndriving over London from the East, and it drove still, as if in the East\r\nthere were an Eternity of cloud and wind. So furious had been the gusts,\r\nthat high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs;\r\nand in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of windmills\r\ncarried away; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast, of\r\nshipwreck and death. Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages\r\nof wind, and the day just closed as I sat down to read had been the\r\nworst of all.\r\n\r\nAlterations have been made in that part of the Temple since that time,\r\nand it has not now so lonely a character as it had then, nor is it so\r\nexposed to the river. We lived at the top of the last house, and the\r\nwind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like discharges\r\nof cannon, or breakings of a sea. When the rain came with it and dashed\r\nagainst the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they\r\nrocked, that I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten lighthouse.\r\nOccasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could\r\nnot bear to go out into such a night; and when I set the doors open and\r\nlooked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out; and when\r\nI shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows\r\n(opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of\r\nsuch wind and rain), I saw that the lamps in the court were blown out,\r\nand that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering, and\r\nthat the coal-fires in barges on the river were being carried away\r\nbefore the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain.\r\n\r\nI read with my watch upon the table, purposing to close my book\r\nat eleven o\'clock. As I shut it, Saint Paul\'s, and all the many\r\nchurch-clocks in the City--some leading, some accompanying, some\r\nfollowing--struck that hour. The sound was curiously flawed by the wind;\r\nand I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it,\r\nwhen I heard a footstep on the stair.\r\n\r\nWhat nervous folly made me start, and awfully connect it with the\r\nfootstep of my dead sister, matters not. It was past in a moment, and I\r\nlistened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on.\r\nRemembering then, that the staircase-lights were blown out, I took up\r\nmy reading-lamp and went out to the stair-head. Whoever was below had\r\nstopped on seeing my lamp, for all was quiet.\r\n\r\n"There is some one down there, is there not?" I called out, looking\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said a voice from the darkness beneath.\r\n\r\n"What floor do you want?"\r\n\r\n"The top. Mr. Pip."\r\n\r\n"That is my name.--There is nothing the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing the matter," returned the voice. And the man came on.\r\n\r\nI stood with my lamp held out over the stair-rail, and he came slowly\r\nwithin its light. It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and its\r\ncircle of light was very contracted; so that he was in it for a mere\r\ninstant, and then out of it. In the instant, I had seen a face that was\r\nstrange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched\r\nand pleased by the sight of me.\r\n\r\nMoving the lamp as the man moved, I made out that he was substantially\r\ndressed, but roughly, like a voyager by sea. That he had long iron-gray\r\nhair. That his age was about sixty. That he was a muscular man, strong\r\non his legs, and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to\r\nweather. As he ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp\r\nincluded us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he was\r\nholding out both his hands to me.\r\n\r\n"Pray what is your business?" I asked him.\r\n\r\n"My business?" he repeated, pausing. "Ah! Yes. I will explain my\r\nbusiness, by your leave."\r\n\r\n"Do you wish to come in?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he replied; "I wish to come in, master."\r\n\r\nI had asked him the question inhospitably enough, for I resented the\r\nsort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face.\r\nI resented it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me to respond\r\nto it. But I took him into the room I had just left, and, having set the\r\nlamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could to explain himself.\r\n\r\nHe looked about him with the strangest air,--an air of wondering\r\npleasure, as if he had some part in the things he admired,--and he\r\npulled off a rough outer coat, and his hat. Then, I saw that his head\r\nwas furrowed and bald, and that the long iron-gray hair grew only on\r\nits sides. But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him. On the\r\ncontrary, I saw him next moment, once more holding out both his hands to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" said I, half suspecting him to be mad.\r\n\r\nHe stopped in his looking at me, and slowly rubbed his right hand over\r\nhis head. "It\'s disapinting to a man," he said, in a coarse broken\r\nvoice, "arter having looked for\'ard so distant, and come so fur; but\r\nyou\'re not to blame for that,--neither on us is to blame for that. I\'ll\r\nspeak in half a minute. Give me half a minute, please."\r\n\r\nHe sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered his\r\nforehead with his large brown veinous hands. I looked at him attentively\r\nthen, and recoiled a little from him; but I did not know him.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no one nigh," said he, looking over his shoulder; "is there?"\r\n\r\n"Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night,\r\nask that question?" said I.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a game one," he returned, shaking his head at me with a\r\ndeliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most exasperating;\r\n"I\'m glad you\'ve grow\'d up, a game one! But don\'t catch hold of me.\r\nYou\'d be sorry arterwards to have done it."\r\n\r\nI relinquished the intention he had detected, for I knew him! Even yet\r\nI could not recall a single feature, but I knew him! If the wind and\r\nthe rain had driven away the intervening years, had scattered all the\r\nintervening objects, had swept us to the churchyard where we first stood\r\nface to face on such different levels, I could not have known my convict\r\nmore distinctly than I knew him now as he sat in the chair before the\r\nfire. No need to take a file from his pocket and show it to me; no need\r\nto take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round his head; no\r\nneed to hug himself with both his arms, and take a shivering turn across\r\nthe room, looking back at me for recognition. I knew him before he gave\r\nme one of those aids, though, a moment before, I had not been conscious\r\nof remotely suspecting his identity.\r\n\r\nHe came back to where I stood, and again held out both his hands.\r\nNot knowing what to do,--for, in my astonishment I had lost my\r\nself-possession,--I reluctantly gave him my hands. He grasped them\r\nheartily, raised them to his lips, kissed them, and still held them.\r\n\r\n"You acted noble, my boy," said he. "Noble, Pip! And I have never forgot\r\nit!"\r\n\r\nAt a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me, I laid\r\na hand upon his breast and put him away.\r\n\r\n"Stay!" said I. "Keep off! If you are grateful to me for what I did when\r\nI was a little child, I hope you have shown your gratitude by mending\r\nyour way of life. If you have come here to thank me, it was not\r\nnecessary. Still, however you have found me out, there must be something\r\ngood in the feeling that has brought you here, and I will not repulse\r\nyou; but surely you must understand that--I--"\r\n\r\nMy attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at\r\nme, that the words died away on my tongue.\r\n\r\n"You was a saying," he observed, when we had confronted one another\r\nin silence, "that surely I must understand. What, surely must I\r\nunderstand?"\r\n\r\n"That I cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long\r\nago, under these different circumstances. I am glad to believe you have\r\nrepented and recovered yourself. I am glad to tell you so. I am glad\r\nthat, thinking I deserve to be thanked, you have come to thank me. But\r\nour ways are different ways, none the less. You are wet, and you look\r\nweary. Will you drink something before you go?"\r\n\r\nHe had replaced his neckerchief loosely, and had stood, keenly observant\r\nof me, biting a long end of it. "I think," he answered, still with the\r\nend at his mouth and still observant of me, "that I will drink (I thank\r\nyou) afore I go."\r\n\r\nThere was a tray ready on a side-table. I brought it to the table\r\nnear the fire, and asked him what he would have? He touched one of the\r\nbottles without looking at it or speaking, and I made him some hot rum\r\nand water. I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but his look\r\nat me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his\r\nneckerchief between his teeth--evidently forgotten--made my hand very\r\ndifficult to master. When at last I put the glass to him, I saw with\r\namazement that his eyes were full of tears.\r\n\r\nUp to this time I had remained standing, not to disguise that I wished\r\nhim gone. But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man, and felt\r\na touch of reproach. "I hope," said I, hurriedly putting something into\r\na glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table, "that you will not\r\nthink I spoke harshly to you just now. I had no intention of doing it,\r\nand I am sorry for it if I did. I wish you well and happy!"\r\n\r\nAs I put my glass to my lips, he glanced with surprise at the end of his\r\nneckerchief, dropping from his mouth when he opened it, and stretched\r\nout his hand. I gave him mine, and then he drank, and drew his sleeve\r\nacross his eyes and forehead.\r\n\r\n"How are you living?" I asked him.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been a sheep-farmer, stock-breeder, other trades besides, away in\r\nthe new world," said he; "many a thousand mile of stormy water off from\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"I hope you have done well?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve done wonderfully well. There\'s others went out alonger me as has\r\ndone well too, but no man has done nigh as well as me. I\'m famous for\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I am glad to hear it."\r\n\r\n"I hope to hear you say so, my dear boy."\r\n\r\nWithout stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which\r\nthey were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come into my\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n"Have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me," I inquired, "since\r\nhe undertook that trust?"\r\n\r\n"Never set eyes upon him. I warn\'t likely to it."\r\n\r\n"He came faithfully, and he brought me the two one-pound notes. I was\r\na poor boy then, as you know, and to a poor boy they were a little\r\nfortune. But, like you, I have done well since, and you must let me pay\r\nthem back. You can put them to some other poor boy\'s use." I took out my\r\npurse.\r\n\r\nHe watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it, and he\r\nwatched me as I separated two one-pound notes from its contents. They\r\nwere clean and new, and I spread them out and handed them over to\r\nhim. Still watching me, he laid them one upon the other, folded them\r\nlong-wise, gave them a twist, set fire to them at the lamp, and dropped\r\nthe ashes into the tray.\r\n\r\n"May I make so bold," he said then, with a smile that was like a frown,\r\nand with a frown that was like a smile, "as ask you how you have done\r\nwell, since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes?"\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"Ah!"\r\n\r\nHe emptied his glass, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, with\r\nhis heavy brown hand on the mantel-shelf. He put a foot up to the bars,\r\nto dry and warm it, and the wet boot began to steam; but, he neither\r\nlooked at it, nor at the fire, but steadily looked at me. It was only\r\nnow that I began to tremble.\r\n\r\nWhen my lips had parted, and had shaped some words that were\r\nwithout sound, I forced myself to tell him (though I could not do it\r\ndistinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.\r\n\r\n"Might a mere warmint ask what property?" said he.\r\n\r\nI faltered, "I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Might a mere warmint ask whose property?" said he.\r\n\r\nI faltered again, "I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Could I make a guess, I wonder," said the Convict, "at your income\r\nsince you come of age! As to the first figure now. Five?"\r\n\r\nWith my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I rose\r\nout of my chair, and stood with my hand upon the back of it, looking\r\nwildly at him.\r\n\r\n"Concerning a guardian," he went on. "There ought to have been some\r\nguardian, or such-like, whiles you was a minor. Some lawyer, maybe. As\r\nto the first letter of that lawyer\'s name now. Would it be J?"\r\n\r\nAll the truth of my position came flashing on me; and its\r\ndisappointments, dangers, disgraces, consequences of all kinds, rushed\r\nin in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had to struggle\r\nfor every breath I drew.\r\n\r\n"Put it," he resumed, "as the employer of that lawyer whose name begun\r\nwith a J, and might be Jaggers,--put it as he had come over sea to\r\nPortsmouth, and had landed there, and had wanted to come on to you.\r\n\'However, you have found me out,\' you says just now. Well! However, did\r\nI find you out? Why, I wrote from Portsmouth to a person in London, for\r\nparticulars of your address. That person\'s name? Why, Wemmick."\r\n\r\nI could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my life.\r\nI stood, with a hand on the chair-back and a hand on my breast, where\r\nI seemed to be suffocating,--I stood so, looking wildly at him, until I\r\ngrasped at the chair, when the room began to surge and turn. He caught\r\nme, drew me to the sofa, put me up against the cushions, and bent on one\r\nknee before me, bringing the face that I now well remembered, and that I\r\nshuddered at, very near to mine.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Pip, dear boy, I\'ve made a gentleman on you! It\'s me wot has\r\ndone it! I swore that time, sure as ever I earned a guinea, that guinea\r\nshould go to you. I swore arterwards, sure as ever I spec\'lated and got\r\nrich, you should get rich. I lived rough, that you should live smooth;\r\nI worked hard, that you should be above work. What odds, dear boy? Do I\r\ntell it, fur you to feel a obligation? Not a bit. I tell it, fur you to\r\nknow as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in, got his head\r\nso high that he could make a gentleman,--and, Pip, you\'re him!"\r\n\r\nThe abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him, the\r\nrepugnance with which I shrank from him, could not have been exceeded if\r\nhe had been some terrible beast.\r\n\r\n"Look\'ee here, Pip. I\'m your second father. You\'re my son,--more to me\r\nnor any son. I\'ve put away money, only for you to spend. When I was a\r\nhired-out shepherd in a solitary hut, not seeing no faces but faces of\r\nsheep till I half forgot wot men\'s and women\'s faces wos like, I see\r\nyourn. I drops my knife many a time in that hut when I was a-eating my\r\ndinner or my supper, and I says, \'Here\'s the boy again, a looking at\r\nme whiles I eats and drinks!\' I see you there a many times, as plain as\r\never I see you on them misty marshes. \'Lord strike me dead!\' I says each\r\ntime,--and I goes out in the air to say it under the open heavens,--\'but\r\nwot, if I gets liberty and money, I\'ll make that boy a gentleman!\' And\r\nI done it. Why, look at you, dear boy! Look at these here lodgings\r\no\'yourn, fit for a lord! A lord? Ah! You shall show money with lords for\r\nwagers, and beat \'em!"\r\n\r\nIn his heat and triumph, and in his knowledge that I had been nearly\r\nfainting, he did not remark on my reception of all this. It was the one\r\ngrain of relief I had.\r\n\r\n"Look\'ee here!" he went on, taking my watch out of my pocket, and\r\nturning towards him a ring on my finger, while I recoiled from his\r\ntouch as if he had been a snake, "a gold \'un and a beauty: that\'s a\r\ngentleman\'s, I hope! A diamond all set round with rubies; that\'s a\r\ngentleman\'s, I hope! Look at your linen; fine and beautiful! Look at\r\nyour clothes; better ain\'t to be got! And your books too," turning his\r\neyes round the room, "mounting up, on their shelves, by hundreds! And\r\nyou read \'em; don\'t you? I see you\'d been a reading of \'em when I come\r\nin. Ha, ha, ha! You shall read \'em to me, dear boy! And if they\'re in\r\nforeign languages wot I don\'t understand, I shall be just as proud as if\r\nI did."\r\n\r\nAgain he took both my hands and put them to his lips, while my blood ran\r\ncold within me.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you mind talking, Pip," said he, after again drawing his sleeve\r\nover his eyes and forehead, as the click came in his throat which I well\r\nremembered,--and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so much\r\nin earnest; "you can\'t do better nor keep quiet, dear boy. You ain\'t\r\nlooked slowly forward to this as I have; you wosn\'t prepared for this as\r\nI wos. But didn\'t you never think it might be me?"\r\n\r\n"O no, no, no," I returned, "Never, never!"\r\n\r\n"Well, you see it wos me, and single-handed. Never a soul in it but my\r\nown self and Mr. Jaggers."\r\n\r\n"Was there no one else?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"No," said he, with a glance of surprise: "who else should there be?\r\nAnd, dear boy, how good looking you have growed! There\'s bright eyes\r\nsomewheres--eh? Isn\'t there bright eyes somewheres, wot you love the\r\nthoughts on?"\r\n\r\nO Estella, Estella!\r\n\r\n"They shall be yourn, dear boy, if money can buy \'em. Not that a\r\ngentleman like you, so well set up as you, can\'t win \'em off of his own\r\ngame; but money shall back you! Let me finish wot I was a telling you,\r\ndear boy. From that there hut and that there hiring-out, I got money\r\nleft me by my master (which died, and had been the same as me), and got\r\nmy liberty and went for myself. In every single thing I went for, I went\r\nfor you. \'Lord strike a blight upon it,\' I says, wotever it was I went\r\nfor, \'if it ain\'t for him!\' It all prospered wonderful. As I giv\' you\r\nto understand just now, I\'m famous for it. It was the money left me, and\r\nthe gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mr. Jaggers--all for\r\nyou--when he first come arter you, agreeable to my letter."\r\n\r\nO that he had never come! That he had left me at the forge,--far from\r\ncontented, yet, by comparison happy!\r\n\r\n"And then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me, look\'ee here, to know in\r\nsecret that I was making a gentleman. The blood horses of them colonists\r\nmight fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do I say? I says\r\nto myself, \'I\'m making a better gentleman nor ever you\'ll be!\' When\r\none of \'em says to another, \'He was a convict, a few year ago, and is a\r\nignorant common fellow now, for all he\'s lucky,\' what do I say? I says\r\nto myself, \'If I ain\'t a gentleman, nor yet ain\'t got no learning, I\'m\r\nthe owner of such. All on you owns stock and land; which on you owns a\r\nbrought-up London gentleman?\' This way I kep myself a going. And this\r\nway I held steady afore my mind that I would for certain come one day\r\nand see my boy, and make myself known to him, on his own ground."\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at the thought that for\r\nanything I knew, his hand might be stained with blood.\r\n\r\n"It warn\'t easy, Pip, for me to leave them parts, nor yet it warn\'t\r\nsafe. But I held to it, and the harder it was, the stronger I held, for\r\nI was determined, and my mind firm made up. At last I done it. Dear boy,\r\nI done it!"\r\n\r\nI tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned. Throughout, I had\r\nseemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him;\r\neven now, I could not separate his voice from those voices, though those\r\nwere loud and his was silent.\r\n\r\n"Where will you put me?" he asked, presently. "I must be put somewheres,\r\ndear boy."\r\n\r\n"To sleep?" said I.\r\n\r\n"Yes. And to sleep long and sound," he answered; "for I\'ve been\r\nsea-tossed and sea-washed, months and months."\r\n\r\n"My friend and companion," said I, rising from the sofa, "is absent; you\r\nmust have his room."\r\n\r\n"He won\'t come back to-morrow; will he?"\r\n\r\n"No," said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmost\r\nefforts; "not to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Because, look\'ee here, dear boy," he said, dropping his voice, and\r\nlaying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, "caution is\r\nnecessary."\r\n\r\n"How do you mean? Caution?"\r\n\r\n"By G----, it\'s Death!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s death?"\r\n\r\n"I was sent for life. It\'s death to come back. There\'s been overmuch\r\ncoming back of late years, and I should of a certainty be hanged if\r\ntook."\r\n\r\nNothing was needed but this; the wretched man, after loading wretched me\r\nwith his gold and silver chains for years, had risked his life to come\r\nto me, and I held it there in my keeping! If I had loved him instead\r\nof abhorring him; if I had been attracted to him by the strongest\r\nadmiration and affection, instead of shrinking from him with the\r\nstrongest repugnance; it could have been no worse. On the contrary, it\r\nwould have been better, for his preservation would then have naturally\r\nand tenderly addressed my heart.\r\n\r\nMy first care was to close the shutters, so that no light might be seen\r\nfrom without, and then to close and make fast the doors. While I did so,\r\nhe stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit; and when I saw\r\nhim thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again. It\r\nalmost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently, to file at his\r\nleg.\r\n\r\nWhen I had gone into Herbert\'s room, and had shut off any other\r\ncommunication between it and the staircase than through the room in\r\nwhich our conversation had been held, I asked him if he would go to bed?\r\nHe said yes, but asked me for some of my "gentleman\'s linen" to put\r\non in the morning. I brought it out, and laid it ready for him, and my\r\nblood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me good\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nI got away from him, without knowing how I did it, and mended the fire\r\nin the room where we had been together, and sat down by it, afraid to go\r\nto bed. For an hour or more, I remained too stunned to think; and it\r\nwas not until I began to think, that I began fully to know how wrecked I\r\nwas, and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces.\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham\'s intentions towards me, all a mere dream; Estella not\r\ndesigned for me; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience, a\r\nsting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart to\r\npractise on when no other practice was at hand; those were the first\r\nsmarts I had. But, sharpest and deepest pain of all,--it was for the\r\nconvict, guilty of I knew not what crimes, and liable to be taken out\r\nof those rooms where I sat thinking, and hanged at the Old Bailey door,\r\nthat I had deserted Joe.\r\n\r\nI would not have gone back to Joe now, I would not have gone back to\r\nBiddy now, for any consideration; simply, I suppose, because my sense of\r\nmy own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration.\r\nNo wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that I should have\r\nderived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I could never, never,\r\nundo what I had done.\r\n\r\nIn every rage of wind and rush of rain, I heard pursuers. Twice, I could\r\nhave sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door. With\r\nthese fears upon me, I began either to imagine or recall that I had had\r\nmysterious warnings of this man\'s approach. That, for weeks gone by, I\r\nhad passed faces in the streets which I had thought like his. That these\r\nlikenesses had grown more numerous, as he, coming over the sea, had\r\ndrawn nearer. That his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers\r\nto mine, and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word,\r\nand with me.\r\n\r\nCrowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seen\r\nhim with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man; that I had\r\nheard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him; that\r\nI had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild\r\nbeast. Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire a\r\nhalf-formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with\r\nhim in the dead of the wild solitary night. This dilated until it filled\r\nthe room, and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my\r\ndreadful burden.\r\n\r\nHe had rolled a handkerchief round his head, and his face was set and\r\nlowering in his sleep. But he was asleep, and quietly too, though he had\r\na pistol lying on the pillow. Assured of this, I softly removed the key\r\nto the outside of his door, and turned it on him before I again sat down\r\nby the fire. Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the floor.\r\nWhen I awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of\r\nmy wretchedness, the clocks of the Eastward churches were striking five,\r\nthe candles were wasted out, the fire was dead, and the wind and rain\r\nintensified the thick black darkness.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS THE END OF THE SECOND STAGE OF PIP\'S EXPECTATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XL\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure (so far\r\nas I could) the safety of my dreaded visitor; for, this thought pressing\r\non me when I awoke, held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was\r\nself-evident. It could not be done, and the attempt to do it would\r\ninevitably engender suspicion. True, I had no Avenger in my service now,\r\nbut I was looked after by an inflammatory old female, assisted by an\r\nanimated rag-bag whom she called her niece, and to keep a room secret\r\nfrom them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration. They both had\r\nweak eyes, which I had long attributed to their chronically looking in\r\nat keyholes, and they were always at hand when not wanted; indeed that\r\nwas their only reliable quality besides larceny. Not to get up a mystery\r\nwith these people, I resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle\r\nhad unexpectedly come from the country.\r\n\r\nThis course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness\r\nfor the means of getting a light. Not stumbling on the means after all,\r\nI was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there to\r\ncome with his lantern. Now, in groping my way down the black staircase I\r\nfell over something, and that something was a man crouching in a corner.\r\n\r\nAs the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there, but eluded\r\nmy touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman to come\r\nquickly; telling him of the incident on the way back. The wind being as\r\nfierce as ever, we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by\r\nrekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase, but we examined the\r\nstaircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there. It then\r\noccurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my\r\nrooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchman\'s, and leaving him\r\nstanding at the door, I examined them carefully, including the room in\r\nwhich my dreaded guest lay asleep. All was quiet, and assuredly no other\r\nman was in those chambers.\r\n\r\nIt troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on\r\nthat night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on the\r\nchance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram\r\nat the door, whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had\r\nperceptibly been dining out? Yes, he said; at different times of the\r\nnight, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in\r\nthe Lane, and he had seen them all go home. Again, the only other man\r\nwho dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in\r\nthe country for some weeks, and he certainly had not returned in the\r\nnight, because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\n"The night being so bad, sir," said the watchman, as he gave me back\r\nmy glass, "uncommon few have come in at my gate. Besides them three\r\ngentlemen that I have named, I don\'t call to mind another since about\r\neleven o\'clock, when a stranger asked for you."\r\n\r\n"My uncle," I muttered. "Yes."\r\n\r\n"You saw him, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Oh yes."\r\n\r\n"Likewise the person with him?"\r\n\r\n"Person with him!" I repeated.\r\n\r\n"I judged the person to be with him," returned the watchman. "The person\r\nstopped, when he stopped to make inquiry of me, and the person took this\r\nway when he took this way."\r\n\r\n"What sort of person?"\r\n\r\nThe watchman had not particularly noticed; he should say a working\r\nperson; to the best of his belief, he had a dust-colored kind of clothes\r\non, under a dark coat. The watchman made more light of the matter than I\r\ndid, and naturally; not having my reason for attaching weight to it.\r\n\r\nWhen I had got rid of him, which I thought it well to do without\r\nprolonging explanations, my mind was much troubled by these two\r\ncircumstances taken together. Whereas they were easy of innocent\r\nsolution apart,--as, for instance, some diner out or diner at home,\r\nwho had not gone near this watchman\'s gate, might have strayed to my\r\nstaircase and dropped asleep there,--and my nameless visitor might have\r\nbrought some one with him to show him the way,--still, joined, they had\r\nan ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a\r\nfew hours had made me.\r\n\r\nI lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the\r\nmorning, and fell into a doze before it. I seemed to have been dozing a\r\nwhole night when the clocks struck six. As there was full an hour and\r\na half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking up uneasily,\r\nwith prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now, making thunder\r\nof the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off into a profound sleep\r\nfrom which the daylight woke me with a start.\r\n\r\nAll this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, nor\r\ncould I do so yet. I had not the power to attend to it. I was greatly\r\ndejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way.\r\nAs to forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed an\r\nelephant. When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild\r\nmorning, all of a leaden hue; when I walked from room to room; when I\r\nsat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my laundress to\r\nappear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how long\r\nI had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, or even\r\nwho I was that made it.\r\n\r\nAt last, the old woman and the niece came in,--the latter with a head\r\nnot easily distinguishable from her dusty broom,--and testified surprise\r\nat sight of me and the fire. To whom I imparted how my uncle had come in\r\nthe night and was then asleep, and how the breakfast preparations were\r\nto be modified accordingly. Then I washed and dressed while they knocked\r\nthe furniture about and made a dust; and so, in a sort of dream\r\nor sleep-waking, I found myself sitting by the fire again, waiting\r\nfor--Him--to come to breakfast.\r\n\r\nBy and by, his door opened and he came out. I could not bring myself to\r\nbear the sight of him, and I thought he had a worse look by daylight.\r\n\r\n"I do not even know," said I, speaking low as he took his seat at the\r\ntable, "by what name to call you. I have given out that you are my\r\nuncle."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, dear boy! Call me uncle."\r\n\r\n"You assumed some name, I suppose, on board ship?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear boy. I took the name of Provis."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to keep that name?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, dear boy, it\'s as good as another,--unless you\'d like\r\nanother."\r\n\r\n"What is your real name?" I asked him in a whisper.\r\n\r\n"Magwitch," he answered, in the same tone; "chrisen\'d Abel."\r\n\r\n"What were you brought up to be?"\r\n\r\n"A warmint, dear boy."\r\n\r\nHe answered quite seriously, and used the word as if it denoted some\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n"When you came into the Temple last night--" said I, pausing to wonder\r\nwhether that could really have been last night, which seemed so long\r\nago.\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear boy?"\r\n\r\n"When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had\r\nyou any one with you?"\r\n\r\n"With me? No, dear boy."\r\n\r\n"But there was some one there?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t take particular notice," he said, dubiously, "not knowing the\r\nways of the place. But I think there was a person, too, come in alonger\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Are you known in London?"\r\n\r\n"I hope not!" said he, giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that\r\nmade me turn hot and sick.\r\n\r\n"Were you known in London, once?"\r\n\r\n"Not over and above, dear boy. I was in the provinces mostly."\r\n\r\n"Were you--tried--in London?"\r\n\r\n"Which time?" said he, with a sharp look.\r\n\r\n"The last time."\r\n\r\nHe nodded. "First knowed Mr. Jaggers that way. Jaggers was for me."\r\n\r\nIt was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for, but he took up\r\na knife, gave it a flourish, and with the words, "And what I done is\r\nworked out and paid for!" fell to at his breakfast.\r\n\r\nHe ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all his actions\r\nwere uncouth, noisy, and greedy. Some of his teeth had failed him since\r\nI saw him eat on the marshes, and as he turned his food in his mouth,\r\nand turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to bear upon\r\nit, he looked terribly like a hungry old dog. If I had begun with any\r\nappetite, he would have taken it away, and I should have sat much as\r\nI did,--repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion, and gloomily\r\nlooking at the cloth.\r\n\r\n"I\'m a heavy grubber, dear boy," he said, as a polite kind of apology\r\nwhen he made an end of his meal, "but I always was. If it had been in\r\nmy constitution to be a lighter grubber, I might ha\' got into lighter\r\ntrouble. Similarly, I must have my smoke. When I was first hired out as\r\nshepherd t\'other side the world, it\'s my belief I should ha\' turned into\r\na molloncolly-mad sheep myself, if I hadn\'t a had my smoke."\r\n\r\nAs he said so, he got up from table, and putting his hand into the\r\nbreast of the pea-coat he wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a\r\nhandful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head. Having\r\nfilled his pipe, he put the surplus tobacco back again, as if his pocket\r\nwere a drawer. Then, he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs,\r\nand lighted his pipe at it, and then turned round on the hearth-rug with\r\nhis back to the fire, and went through his favorite action of holding\r\nout both his hands for mine.\r\n\r\n"And this," said he, dandling my hands up and down in his, as he puffed\r\nat his pipe,--"and this is the gentleman what I made! The real genuine\r\nOne! It does me good fur to look at you, Pip. All I stip\'late, is, to\r\nstand by and look at you, dear boy!"\r\n\r\nI released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginning\r\nslowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition. What I was\r\nchained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard his\r\nhoarse voice, and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron\r\ngray hair at the sides.\r\n\r\n"I mustn\'t see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets;\r\nthere mustn\'t be no mud on his boots. My gentleman must have horses,\r\nPip! Horses to ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his servant\r\nto ride and drive as well. Shall colonists have their horses (and blood\r\n\'uns, if you please, good Lord!) and not my London gentleman? No, no.\r\nWe\'ll show \'em another pair of shoes than that, Pip; won\'t us?"\r\n\r\nHe took out of his pocket a great thick pocket-book, bursting with\r\npapers, and tossed it on the table.\r\n\r\n"There\'s something worth spending in that there book, dear boy. It\'s\r\nyourn. All I\'ve got ain\'t mine; it\'s yourn. Don\'t you be afeerd on it.\r\nThere\'s more where that come from. I\'ve come to the old country fur\r\nto see my gentleman spend his money like a gentleman. That\'ll be my\r\npleasure. My pleasure \'ull be fur to see him do it. And blast you all!"\r\nhe wound up, looking round the room and snapping his fingers once with\r\na loud snap, "blast you every one, from the judge in his wig, to the\r\ncolonist a stirring up the dust, I\'ll show a better gentleman than the\r\nwhole kit on you put together!"\r\n\r\n"Stop!" said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, "I want to speak\r\nto you. I want to know what is to be done. I want to know how you are to\r\nbe kept out of danger, how long you are going to stay, what projects you\r\nhave."\r\n\r\n"Look\'ee here, Pip," said he, laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly\r\naltered and subdued manner; "first of all, look\'ee here. I forgot myself\r\nhalf a minute ago. What I said was low; that\'s what it was; low. Look\'ee\r\nhere, Pip. Look over it. I ain\'t a going to be low."\r\n\r\n"First," I resumed, half groaning, "what precautions can be taken\r\nagainst your being recognized and seized?"\r\n\r\n"No, dear boy," he said, in the same tone as before, "that don\'t\r\ngo first. Lowness goes first. I ain\'t took so many year to make a\r\ngentleman, not without knowing what\'s due to him. Look\'ee here, Pip. I\r\nwas low; that\'s what I was; low. Look over it, dear boy."\r\n\r\nSome sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as I\r\nreplied, "I have looked over it. In Heaven\'s name, don\'t harp upon it!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but look\'ee here," he persisted. "Dear boy, I ain\'t come so fur,\r\nnot fur to be low. Now, go on, dear boy. You was a saying--"\r\n\r\n"How are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?"\r\n\r\n"Well, dear boy, the danger ain\'t so great. Without I was informed\r\nagen, the danger ain\'t so much to signify. There\'s Jaggers, and there\'s\r\nWemmick, and there\'s you. Who else is there to inform?"\r\n\r\n"Is there no chance person who might identify you in the street?" said\r\nI.\r\n\r\n"Well," he returned, "there ain\'t many. Nor yet I don\'t intend to\r\nadvertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back from\r\nBotany Bay; and years have rolled away, and who\'s to gain by it? Still,\r\nlook\'ee here, Pip. If the danger had been fifty times as great, I should\r\nha\' come to see you, mind you, just the same."\r\n\r\n"And how long do you remain?"\r\n\r\n"How long?" said he, taking his black pipe from his mouth, and dropping\r\nhis jaw as he stared at me. "I\'m not a going back. I\'ve come for good."\r\n\r\n"Where are you to live?" said I. "What is to be done with you? Where\r\nwill you be safe?"\r\n\r\n"Dear boy," he returned, "there\'s disguising wigs can be bought\r\nfor money, and there\'s hair powder, and spectacles, and black\r\nclothes,--shorts and what not. Others has done it safe afore, and what\r\nothers has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and how of\r\nliving, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it."\r\n\r\n"You take it smoothly now," said I, "but you were very serious last\r\nnight, when you swore it was Death."\r\n\r\n"And so I swear it is Death," said he, putting his pipe back in his\r\nmouth, "and Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this, and\r\nit\'s serious that you should fully understand it to be so. What then,\r\nwhen that\'s once done? Here I am. To go back now \'ud be as bad as to\r\nstand ground--worse. Besides, Pip, I\'m here, because I\'ve meant it by\r\nyou, years and years. As to what I dare, I\'m a old bird now, as has\r\ndared all manner of traps since first he was fledged, and I\'m not afeerd\r\nto perch upon a scarecrow. If there\'s Death hid inside of it, there is,\r\nand let him come out, and I\'ll face him, and then I\'ll believe in him\r\nand not afore. And now let me have a look at my gentleman agen."\r\n\r\nOnce more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of\r\nadmiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some\r\nquiet lodging hard by, of which he might take possession when Herbert\r\nreturned: whom I expected in two or three days. That the secret must\r\nbe confided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity, even if I\r\ncould have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with\r\nhim out of the question, was plain to me. But it was by no means so\r\nplain to Mr. Provis (I resolved to call him by that name), who reserved\r\nhis consent to Herbert\'s participation until he should have seen him\r\nand formed a favorable judgment of his physiognomy. "And even then, dear\r\nboy," said he, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out of\r\nhis pocket, "we\'ll have him on his oath."\r\n\r\nTo state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about\r\nthe world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to\r\nstate what I never quite established; but this I can say, that I never\r\nknew him put it to any other use. The book itself had the appearance of\r\nhaving been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps his knowledge\r\nof its antecedents, combined with his own experience in that wise, gave\r\nhim a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm. On this\r\nfirst occasion of his producing it, I recalled how he had made me swear\r\nfidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he had described himself\r\nlast night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude.\r\n\r\nAs he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he\r\nlooked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next\r\ndiscussed with him what dress he should wear. He cherished an\r\nextraordinary belief in the virtues of "shorts" as a disguise, and had\r\nin his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made\r\nhim something between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable\r\ndifficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a\r\nprosperous farmer\'s; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close,\r\nand wear a little powder. Lastly, as he had not yet been seen by the\r\nlaundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their view until\r\nhis change of dress was made.\r\n\r\nIt would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my\r\ndazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not\r\nget out to further them until two or three in the afternoon. He was to\r\nremain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account\r\nto open the door.\r\n\r\nThere being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in Essex Street,\r\nthe back of which looked into the Temple, and was almost within hail of\r\nmy windows, I first of all repaired to that house, and was so fortunate\r\nas to secure the second floor for my uncle, Mr. Provis. I then went from\r\nshop to shop, making such purchases as were necessary to the change in\r\nhis appearance. This business transacted, I turned my face, on my own\r\naccount, to Little Britain. Mr. Jaggers was at his desk, but, seeing me\r\nenter, got up immediately and stood before his fire.\r\n\r\n"Now, Pip," said he, "be careful."\r\n\r\n"I will, sir," I returned. For, coming along I had thought well of what\r\nI was going to say.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t commit yourself," said Mr. Jaggers, "and don\'t commit any one.\r\nYou understand--any one. Don\'t tell me anything: I don\'t want to know\r\nanything; I am not curious."\r\n\r\nOf course I saw that he knew the man was come.\r\n\r\n"I merely want, Mr. Jaggers," said I, "to assure myself that what I have\r\nbeen told is true. I have no hope of its being untrue, but at least I\r\nmay verify it."\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers nodded. "But did you say \'told\' or \'informed\'?" he asked\r\nme, with his head on one side, and not looking at me, but looking in\r\na listening way at the floor. "Told would seem to imply verbal\r\ncommunication. You can\'t have verbal communication with a man in New\r\nSouth Wales, you know."\r\n\r\n"I will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers."\r\n\r\n"Good."\r\n\r\n"I have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he is the\r\nbenefactor so long unknown to me."\r\n\r\n"That is the man," said Mr. Jaggers, "in New South Wales."\r\n\r\n"And only he?" said I.\r\n\r\n"And only he," said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n"I am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible for\r\nmy mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was Miss\r\nHavisham."\r\n\r\n"As you say, Pip," returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his eyes upon\r\nme coolly, and taking a bite at his forefinger, "I am not at all\r\nresponsible for that."\r\n\r\n"And yet it looked so like it, sir," I pleaded with a downcast heart.\r\n\r\n"Not a particle of evidence, Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, shaking his head\r\nand gathering up his skirts. "Take nothing on its looks; take everything\r\non evidence. There\'s no better rule."\r\n\r\n"I have no more to say," said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for\r\na little while. "I have verified my information, and there\'s an end."\r\n\r\n"And Magwitch--in New South Wales--having at last disclosed himself,"\r\nsaid Mr. Jaggers, "you will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout\r\nmy communication with you, I have always adhered to the strict line of\r\nfact. There has never been the least departure from the strict line of\r\nfact. You are quite aware of that?"\r\n\r\n"Quite, sir."\r\n\r\n"I communicated to Magwitch--in New South Wales--when he first wrote to\r\nme--from New South Wales--the caution that he must not expect me ever to\r\ndeviate from the strict line of fact. I also communicated to him another\r\ncaution. He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at\r\nsome distant idea he had of seeing you in England here. I cautioned\r\nhim that I must hear no more of that; that he was not at all likely to\r\nobtain a pardon; that he was expatriated for the term of his natural\r\nlife; and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of\r\nfelony, rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law. I gave\r\nMagwitch that caution," said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard at me; "I wrote\r\nit to New South Wales. He guided himself by it, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"No doubt," said I.\r\n\r\n"I have been informed by Wemmick," pursued Mr. Jaggers, still looking\r\nhard at me, "that he has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from\r\na colonist of the name of Purvis, or--"\r\n\r\n"Or Provis," I suggested.\r\n\r\n"Or Provis--thank you, Pip. Perhaps it is Provis? Perhaps you know it\'s\r\nProvis?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said I.\r\n\r\n"You know it\'s Provis. A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist\r\nof the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on\r\nbehalf of Magwitch. Wemmick sent him the particulars, I understand, by\r\nreturn of post. Probably it is through Provis that you have received the\r\nexplanation of Magwitch--in New South Wales?"\r\n\r\n"It came through Provis," I replied.\r\n\r\n"Good day, Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, offering his hand; "glad to have\r\nseen you. In writing by post to Magwitch--in New South Wales--or in\r\ncommunicating with him through Provis, have the goodness to mention that\r\nthe particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you,\r\ntogether with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining. Good\r\nday, Pip!"\r\n\r\nWe shook hands, and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me. I\r\nturned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the two\r\nvile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open,\r\nand to force out of their swollen throats, "O, what a man he is!"\r\n\r\nWemmick was out, and though he had been at his desk he could have done\r\nnothing for me. I went straight back to the Temple, where I found\r\nthe terrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro-head, in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nNext day the clothes I had ordered all came home, and he put them on.\r\nWhatever he put on, became him less (it dismally seemed to me) than what\r\nhe had worn before. To my thinking, there was something in him that made\r\nit hopeless to attempt to disguise him. The more I dressed him and the\r\nbetter I dressed him, the more he looked like the slouching fugitive on\r\nthe marshes. This effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable, no\r\ndoubt, to his old face and manner growing more familiar to me; but I\r\nbelieve too that he dragged one of his legs as if there were still a\r\nweight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there was Convict in\r\nthe very grain of the man.\r\n\r\nThe influences of his solitary hut-life were upon him besides, and\r\ngave him a savage air that no dress could tame; added to these were the\r\ninfluences of his subsequent branded life among men, and, crowning all,\r\nhis consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now. In all his ways of\r\nsitting and standing, and eating and drinking,--of brooding about in a\r\nhigh-shouldered reluctant style,--of taking out his great horn-handled\r\njackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food,--of\r\nlifting light glasses and cups to his lips, as if they were clumsy\r\npannikins,--of chopping a wedge off his bread, and soaking up with it\r\nthe last fragments of gravy round and round his plate, as if to make the\r\nmost of an allowance, and then drying his finger-ends on it, and then\r\nswallowing it,--in these ways and a thousand other small nameless\r\ninstances arising every minute in the day, there was Prisoner, Felon,\r\nBondsman, plain as plain could be.\r\n\r\nIt had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I had\r\nconceded the powder after overcoming the shorts. But I can compare the\r\neffect of it, when on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon\r\nthe dead; so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it was\r\nmost desirable to repress, started through that thin layer of pretence,\r\nand seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head. It was\r\nabandoned as soon as tried, and he wore his grizzled hair cut short.\r\n\r\nWords cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the dreadful\r\nmystery that he was to me. When he fell asleep of an evening, with his\r\nknotted hands clenching the sides of the easy-chair, and his bald head\r\ntattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast, I would sit\r\nand look at him, wondering what he had done, and loading him with all\r\nthe crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me to\r\nstart up and fly from him. Every hour so increased my abhorrence of\r\nhim, that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the first\r\nagonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he had done for me and\r\nthe risk he ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon come back.\r\nOnce, I actually did start out of bed in the night, and begin to dress\r\nmyself in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leave him there with\r\neverything else I possessed, and enlist for India as a private soldier.\r\n\r\nI doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in those\r\nlonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind and the\r\nrain always rushing by. A ghost could not have been taken and hanged on\r\nmy account, and the consideration that he could be, and the dread that\r\nhe would be, were no small addition to my horrors. When he was not\r\nasleep, or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a ragged pack of\r\ncards of his own,--a game that I never saw before or since, and in which\r\nhe recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the table,--when\r\nhe was not engaged in either of these pursuits, he would ask me to\r\nread to him,--"Foreign language, dear boy!" While I complied, he, not\r\ncomprehending a single word, would stand before the fire surveying me\r\nwith the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see him, between the fingers\r\nof the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumb show to\r\nthe furniture to take notice of my proficiency. The imaginary student\r\npursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made, was not more\r\nwretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made me, and recoiling\r\nfrom him with a stronger repulsion, the more he admired me and the\r\nfonder he was of me.\r\n\r\nThis is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year. It lasted\r\nabout five days. Expecting Herbert all the time, I dared not go out,\r\nexcept when I took Provis for an airing after dark. At length, one\r\nevening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quite\r\nworn out,--for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful\r\ndreams,--I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase. Provis,\r\nwho had been asleep too, staggered up at the noise I made, and in an\r\ninstant I saw his jackknife shining in his hand.\r\n\r\n"Quiet! It\'s Herbert!" I said; and Herbert came bursting in, with the\r\nairy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him.\r\n\r\n"Handel, my dear fellow, how are you, and again how are you, and again\r\nhow are you? I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth! Why, so I must have\r\nbeen, for you have grown quite thin and pale! Handel, my--Halloa! I beg\r\nyour pardon."\r\n\r\nHe was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me, by\r\nseeing Provis. Provis, regarding him with a fixed attention, was slowly\r\nputting up his jackknife, and groping in another pocket for something\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n"Herbert, my dear friend," said I, shutting the double doors, while\r\nHerbert stood staring and wondering, "something very strange has\r\nhappened. This is--a visitor of mine."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, dear boy!" said Provis coming forward, with his little\r\nclasped black book, and then addressing himself to Herbert. "Take it in\r\nyour right hand. Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in\r\nany way sumever! Kiss it!"\r\n\r\n"Do so, as he wishes it," I said to Herbert. So, Herbert, looking at\r\nme with a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis\r\nimmediately shaking hands with him, said, "Now you\'re on your oath, you\r\nknow. And never believe me on mine, if Pip shan\'t make a gentleman on\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLI\r\n\r\nIn vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet\r\nof Herbert, when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and I\r\nrecounted the whole of the secret. Enough, that I saw my own feelings\r\nreflected in Herbert\'s face, and not least among them, my repugnance\r\ntowards the man who had done so much for me.\r\n\r\nWhat would alone have set a division between that man and us, if there\r\nhad been no other dividing circumstance, was his triumph in my story.\r\nSaving his troublesome sense of having been "low" on one occasion since\r\nhis return,--on which point he began to hold forth to Herbert, the\r\nmoment my revelation was finished,--he had no perception of the\r\npossibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune. His boast that\r\nhe had made me a gentleman, and that he had come to see me support the\r\ncharacter on his ample resources, was made for me quite as much as for\r\nhimself. And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us,\r\nand that we must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quite\r\nestablished in his own mind.\r\n\r\n"Though, look\'ee here, Pip\'s comrade," he said to Herbert, after having\r\ndiscoursed for some time, "I know very well that once since I come\r\nback--for half a minute--I\'ve been low. I said to Pip, I knowed as I had\r\nbeen low. But don\'t you fret yourself on that score. I ain\'t made Pip a\r\ngentleman, and Pip ain\'t a going to make you a gentleman, not fur me not\r\nto know what\'s due to ye both. Dear boy, and Pip\'s comrade, you two may\r\ncount upon me always having a gen-teel muzzle on. Muzzled I have been\r\nsince that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness, muzzled I am\r\nat the present time, muzzled I ever will be."\r\n\r\nHerbert said, "Certainly," but looked as if there were no specific\r\nconsolation in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed. We were\r\nanxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us\r\ntogether, but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together, and sat\r\nlate. It was midnight before I took him round to Essex Street, and\r\nsaw him safely in at his own dark door. When it closed upon him, I\r\nexperienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of\r\nhis arrival.\r\n\r\nNever quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs,\r\nI had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark, and in\r\nbringing him back; and I looked about me now. Difficult as it is in a\r\nlarge city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind is\r\nconscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself that any\r\nof the people within sight cared about my movements. The few who were\r\npassing passed on their several ways, and the street was empty when I\r\nturned back into the Temple. Nobody had come out at the gate with us,\r\nnobody went in at the gate with me. As I crossed by the fountain, I saw\r\nhis lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and, when I stood for\r\na few moments in the doorway of the building where I lived, before going\r\nup the stairs, Garden Court was as still and lifeless as the staircase\r\nwas when I ascended it.\r\n\r\nHerbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so\r\nblessedly what it is to have a friend. When he had spoken some sound\r\nwords of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the\r\nquestion, What was to be done?\r\n\r\nThe chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had\r\nstood,--for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot, in\r\none unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances with\r\nhis pipe and his negro-head and his jackknife and his pack of cards,\r\nand what not, as if it were all put down for him on a slate,--I say his\r\nchair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, but\r\nnext moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another. He had\r\nno occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my\r\npatron, neither had I occasion to confess my own. We interchanged that\r\nconfidence without shaping a syllable.\r\n\r\n"What," said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair,--"what is\r\nto be done?"\r\n\r\n"My poor dear Handel," he replied, holding his head, "I am too stunned\r\nto think."\r\n\r\n"So was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell. Still, something must be\r\ndone. He is intent upon various new expenses,--horses, and carriages,\r\nand lavish appearances of all kinds. He must be stopped somehow."\r\n\r\n"You mean that you can\'t accept--"\r\n\r\n"How can I?" I interposed, as Herbert paused. "Think of him! Look at\r\nhim!"\r\n\r\nAn involuntary shudder passed over both of us.\r\n\r\n"Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached to\r\nme, strongly attached to me. Was there ever such a fate!"\r\n\r\n"My poor dear Handel," Herbert repeated.\r\n\r\n"Then," said I, "after all, stopping short here, never taking another\r\npenny from him, think what I owe him already! Then again: I am heavily\r\nin debt,--very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,--and I have\r\nbeen bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, well!" Herbert remonstrated. "Don\'t say fit for nothing."\r\n\r\n"What am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that\r\nis, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but for\r\nthe prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection."\r\n\r\nOf course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing a\r\nwarm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, my dear Handel," said he presently, "soldiering won\'t do. If\r\nyou were to renounce this patronage and these favors, I suppose you\r\nwould do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have\r\nalready had. Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!\r\nBesides, it\'s absurd. You would be infinitely better in Clarriker\'s\r\nhouse, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, you know."\r\n\r\nPoor fellow! He little suspected with whose money.\r\n\r\n"But there is another question," said Herbert. "This is an ignorant,\r\ndetermined man, who has long had one fixed idea. More than that, he\r\nseems to me (I may misjudge him) to be a man of a desperate and fierce\r\ncharacter."\r\n\r\n"I know he is," I returned. "Let me tell you what evidence I have seen\r\nof it." And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative, of that\r\nencounter with the other convict.\r\n\r\n"See, then," said Herbert; "think of this! He comes here at the peril\r\nof his life, for the realization of his fixed idea. In the moment of\r\nrealization, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground from\r\nunder his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless to him.\r\nDo you see nothing that he might do, under the disappointment?"\r\n\r\n"I have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night\r\nof his arrival. Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his\r\nputting himself in the way of being taken."\r\n\r\n"Then you may rely upon it," said Herbert, "that there would be great\r\ndanger of his doing it. That is his power over you as long as he remains\r\nin England, and that would be his reckless course if you forsook him."\r\n\r\nI was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon\r\nme from the first, and the working out of which would make me regard\r\nmyself, in some sort, as his murderer, that I could not rest in my\r\nchair, but began pacing to and fro. I said to Herbert, meanwhile, that\r\neven if Provis were recognized and taken, in spite of himself, I should\r\nbe wretched as the cause, however innocently. Yes; even though I was so\r\nwretched in having him at large and near me, and even though I would\r\nfar rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I would\r\never have come to this!\r\n\r\nBut there was no staving off the question, What was to be done?\r\n\r\n"The first and the main thing to be done," said Herbert, "is to get him\r\nout of England. You will have to go with him, and then he may be induced\r\nto go."\r\n\r\n"But get him where I will, could I prevent his coming back?"\r\n\r\n"My good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next street,\r\nthere must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him and\r\nmaking him reckless, here, than elsewhere? If a pretext to get him away\r\ncould be made out of that other convict, or out of anything else in his\r\nlife, now."\r\n\r\n"There, again!" said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open hands held\r\nout, as if they contained the desperation of the case. "I know nothing\r\nof his life. It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see\r\nhim before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes, and yet so\r\nunknown to me, except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days\r\nin my childhood!"\r\n\r\nHerbert got up, and linked his arm in mine, and we slowly walked to and\r\nfro together, studying the carpet.\r\n\r\n"Handel," said Herbert, stopping, "you feel convinced that you can take\r\nno further benefits from him; do you?"\r\n\r\n"Fully. Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?"\r\n\r\n"And you feel convinced that you must break with him?"\r\n\r\n"Herbert, can you ask me?"\r\n\r\n"And you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life he\r\nhas risked on your account, that you must save him, if possible, from\r\nthrowing it away. Then you must get him out of England before you stir a\r\nfinger to extricate yourself. That done, extricate yourself, in Heaven\'s\r\nname, and we\'ll see it out together, dear old boy."\r\n\r\nIt was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down again,\r\nwith only that done.\r\n\r\n"Now, Herbert," said I, "with reference to gaining some knowledge of\r\nhis history. There is but one way that I know of. I must ask him point\r\nblank."\r\n\r\n"Yes. Ask him," said Herbert, "when we sit at breakfast in the morning."\r\nFor he had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that he would come to\r\nbreakfast with us.\r\n\r\nWith this project formed, we went to bed. I had the wildest dreams\r\nconcerning him, and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to recover the fear\r\nwhich I had lost in the night, of his being found out as a returned\r\ntransport. Waking, I never lost that fear.\r\n\r\nHe came round at the appointed time, took out his jackknife, and sat\r\ndown to his meal. He was full of plans "for his gentleman\'s coming out\r\nstrong, and like a gentleman," and urged me to begin speedily upon\r\nthe pocket-book which he had left in my possession. He considered the\r\nchambers and his own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me to\r\nlook out at once for a "fashionable crib" near Hyde Park, in which he\r\ncould have "a shake-down." When he had made an end of his breakfast,\r\nand was wiping his knife on his leg, I said to him, without a word of\r\npreface,--\r\n\r\n"After you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle that\r\nthe soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we came up. You\r\nremember?"\r\n\r\n"Remember!" said he. "I think so!"\r\n\r\n"We want to know something about that man--and about you. It is strange\r\nto know no more about either, and particularly you, than I was able to\r\ntell last night. Is not this as good a time as another for our knowing\r\nmore?"\r\n\r\n"Well!" he said, after consideration. "You\'re on your oath, you know,\r\nPip\'s comrade?"\r\n\r\n"Assuredly," replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n"As to anything I say, you know," he insisted. "The oath applies to\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"I understand it to do so."\r\n\r\n"And look\'ee here! Wotever I done is worked out and paid for," he\r\ninsisted again.\r\n\r\n"So be it."\r\n\r\nHe took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negro-head,\r\nwhen, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand, he seemed to think\r\nit might perplex the thread of his narrative. He put it back again,\r\nstuck his pipe in a button-hole of his coat, spread a hand on each knee,\r\nand after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments,\r\nlooked round at us and said what follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLII\r\n\r\n"Dear boy and Pip\'s comrade. I am not a going fur to tell you my life\r\nlike a song, or a story-book. But to give it you short and handy, I\'ll\r\nput it at once into a mouthful of English. In jail and out of jail, in\r\njail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail. There, you\'ve got it.\r\nThat\'s my life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off,\r\narter Pip stood my friend.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been done everything to, pretty well--except hanged. I\'ve been\r\nlocked up as much as a silver tea-kittle. I\'ve been carted here and\r\ncarted there, and put out of this town, and put out of that town, and\r\nstuck in the stocks, and whipped and worried and drove. I\'ve no more\r\nnotion where I was born than you have--if so much. I first become aware\r\nof myself down in Essex, a thieving turnips for my living. Summun had\r\nrun away from me--a man--a tinker--and he\'d took the fire with him, and\r\nleft me wery cold.\r\n\r\n"I know\'d my name to be Magwitch, chrisen\'d Abel. How did I know\r\nit? Much as I know\'d the birds\' names in the hedges to be chaffinch,\r\nsparrer, thrush. I might have thought it was all lies together, only as\r\nthe birds\' names come out true, I supposed mine did.\r\n\r\n"So fur as I could find, there warn\'t a soul that see young Abel\r\nMagwitch, with us little on him as in him, but wot caught fright at him,\r\nand either drove him off, or took him up. I was took up, took up, took\r\nup, to that extent that I reg\'larly grow\'d up took up.\r\n\r\n"This is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as much\r\nto be pitied as ever I see (not that I looked in the glass, for there\r\nwarn\'t many insides of furnished houses known to me), I got the name of\r\nbeing hardened. \'This is a terrible hardened one,\' they says to prison\r\nwisitors, picking out me. \'May be said to live in jails, this boy.\' Then\r\nthey looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measured my head, some\r\non \'em,--they had better a measured my stomach,--and others on \'em giv\r\nme tracts what I couldn\'t read, and made me speeches what I couldn\'t\r\nunderstand. They always went on agen me about the Devil. But what\r\nthe Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach, mustn\'t\r\nI?--Howsomever, I\'m a getting low, and I know what\'s due. Dear boy and\r\nPip\'s comrade, don\'t you be afeerd of me being low.\r\n\r\n"Tramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could,--though\r\nthat warn\'t as often as you may think, till you put the question whether\r\nyou would ha\' been over-ready to give me work yourselves,--a bit of a\r\npoacher, a bit of a laborer, a bit of a wagoner, a bit of a haymaker,\r\na bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that don\'t pay and lead to\r\ntrouble, I got to be a man. A deserting soldier in a Traveller\'s Rest,\r\nwhat lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs, learnt me to read;\r\nand a travelling Giant what signed his name at a penny a time learnt me\r\nto write. I warn\'t locked up as often now as formerly, but I wore out my\r\ngood share of key-metal still.\r\n\r\n"At Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted wi\'\r\na man whose skull I\'d crack wi\' this poker, like the claw of a lobster,\r\nif I\'d got it on this hob. His right name was Compeyson; and that\'s the\r\nman, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch, according to\r\nwhat you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last night.\r\n\r\n"He set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he\'d been to a public\r\nboarding-school and had learning. He was a smooth one to talk, and was\r\na dab at the ways of gentlefolks. He was good-looking too. It was the\r\nnight afore the great race, when I found him on the heath, in a booth\r\nthat I know\'d on. Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when\r\nI went in, and the landlord (which had a knowledge of me, and was a\r\nsporting one) called him out, and said, \'I think this is a man that\r\nmight suit you,\'--meaning I was.\r\n\r\n"Compeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him. He has a\r\nwatch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n"\'To judge from appearances, you\'re out of luck,\' says Compeyson to me.\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, master, and I\'ve never been in it much.\' (I had come out of\r\nKingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might have\r\nbeen for something else; but it warn\'t.)\r\n\r\n"\'Luck changes,\' says Compeyson; \'perhaps yours is going to change.\'\r\n\r\n"I says, \'I hope it may be so. There\'s room.\'\r\n\r\n"\'What can you do?\' says Compeyson.\r\n\r\n"\'Eat and drink,\' I says; \'if you\'ll find the materials.\'\r\n\r\n"Compeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five\r\nshillings, and appointed me for next night. Same place.\r\n\r\n"I went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on\r\nto be his man and pardner. And what was Compeyson\'s business in which we\r\nwas to go pardners? Compeyson\'s business was the swindling, handwriting\r\nforging, stolen bank-note passing, and such-like. All sorts of traps as\r\nCompeyson could set with his head, and keep his own legs out of and get\r\nthe profits from and let another man in for, was Compeyson\'s business.\r\nHe\'d no more heart than a iron file, he was as cold as death, and he had\r\nthe head of the Devil afore mentioned.\r\n\r\n"There was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur,--not as\r\nbeing so chrisen\'d, but as a surname. He was in a Decline, and was a\r\nshadow to look at. Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a\r\nrich lady some years afore, and they\'d made a pot of money by it; but\r\nCompeyson betted and gamed, and he\'d have run through the king\'s taxes.\r\nSo, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him,\r\nand Compeyson\'s wife (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a having pity\r\non him when she could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and\r\nnobody.\r\n\r\n"I might a took warning by Arthur, but I didn\'t; and I won\'t pretend I\r\nwas partick\'ler--for where \'ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade?\r\nSo I begun wi\' Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his hands. Arthur\r\nlived at the top of Compeyson\'s house (over nigh Brentford it was), and\r\nCompeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging, in case\r\nhe should ever get better to work it out. But Arthur soon settled the\r\naccount. The second or third time as ever I see him, he come a tearing\r\ndown into Compeyson\'s parlor late at night, in only a flannel gown, with\r\nhis hair all in a sweat, and he says to Compeyson\'s wife, \'Sally, she\r\nreally is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can\'t get rid of her. She\'s\r\nall in white,\' he says, \'wi\' white flowers in her hair, and she\'s awful\r\nmad, and she\'s got a shroud hanging over her arm, and she says she\'ll\r\nput it on me at five in the morning.\'\r\n\r\n"Says Compeyson: \'Why, you fool, don\'t you know she\'s got a living body?\r\nAnd how should she be up there, without coming through the door, or in\r\nat the window, and up the stairs?\'\r\n\r\n"\'I don\'t know how she\'s there,\' says Arthur, shivering dreadful with\r\nthe horrors, \'but she\'s standing in the corner at the foot of the bed,\r\nawful mad. And over where her heart\'s broke--you broke it!--there\'s\r\ndrops of blood.\'\r\n\r\n"Compeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward. \'Go up alonger this\r\ndrivelling sick man,\' he says to his wife, \'and Magwitch, lend her a\r\nhand, will you?\' But he never come nigh himself.\r\n\r\n"Compeyson\'s wife and me took him up to bed agen, and he raved most\r\ndreadful. \'Why look at her!\' he cries out. \'She\'s a shaking the shroud\r\nat me! Don\'t you see her? Look at her eyes! Ain\'t it awful to see her so\r\nmad?\' Next he cries, \'She\'ll put it on me, and then I\'m done for! Take\r\nit away from her, take it away!\' And then he catched hold of us, and kep\r\non a talking to her, and answering of her, till I half believed I see\r\nher myself.\r\n\r\n"Compeyson\'s wife, being used to him, giv him some liquor to get the\r\nhorrors off, and by and by he quieted. \'O, she\'s gone! Has her keeper\r\nbeen for her?\' he says. \'Yes,\' says Compeyson\'s wife. \'Did you tell him\r\nto lock her and bar her in?\' \'Yes.\' \'And to take that ugly thing away\r\nfrom her?\' \'Yes, yes, all right.\' \'You\'re a good creetur,\' he says,\r\n\'don\'t leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!\'\r\n\r\n"He rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and\r\nthen he starts up with a scream, and screams out, \'Here she is! She\'s\r\ngot the shroud again. She\'s unfolding it. She\'s coming out of the\r\ncorner. She\'s coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you--one of each\r\nside--don\'t let her touch me with it. Hah! she missed me that time.\r\nDon\'t let her throw it over my shoulders. Don\'t let her lift me up to\r\nget it round me. She\'s lifting me up. Keep me down!\' Then he lifted\r\nhimself up hard, and was dead.\r\n\r\n"Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Him and\r\nme was soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on my own\r\nbook,--this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade\r\non.\r\n\r\n"Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done--which \'ud\r\ntake a week--I\'ll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip\'s comrade, that\r\nthat man got me into such nets as made me his black slave. I was always\r\nin debt to him, always under his thumb, always a working, always a\r\ngetting into danger. He was younger than me, but he\'d got craft, and\r\nhe\'d got learning, and he overmatched me five hundred times told and\r\nno mercy. My Missis as I had the hard time wi\'--Stop though! I ain\'t\r\nbrought her in--"\r\n\r\nHe looked about him in a confused way, as if he had lost his place in\r\nthe book of his remembrance; and he turned his face to the fire, and\r\nspread his hands broader on his knees, and lifted them off and put them\r\non again.\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t no need to go into it," he said, looking round once more.\r\n"The time wi\' Compeyson was a\'most as hard a time as ever I had; that\r\nsaid, all\'s said. Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for misdemeanor,\r\nwhile with Compeyson?"\r\n\r\nI answered, No.\r\n\r\n"Well!" he said, "I was, and got convicted. As to took up on suspicion,\r\nthat was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted;\r\nbut evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was both committed\r\nfor felony,--on a charge of putting stolen notes in circulation,--and\r\nthere was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me, \'Separate\r\ndefences, no communication,\' and that was all. And I was so miserable\r\npoor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on my back,\r\nafore I could get Jaggers.\r\n\r\n"When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman\r\nCompeyson looked, wi\' his curly hair and his black clothes and his white\r\npocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked. When\r\nthe prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand, I\r\nnoticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him. When the\r\nevidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had\r\ncome for\'ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the money\r\nhad been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing\r\nand get the profit. But when the defence come on, then I see the plan\r\nplainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, \'My lord and gentlemen,\r\nhere you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your eyes can\r\nseparate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be spoke to\r\nas such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to as such;\r\none, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here transactions, and\r\nonly suspected; t\'other, the elder, always seen in \'em and always wi\' his\r\nguilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there is but one in it, which is\r\nthe one, and, if there is two in it, which is much the worst one?\' And\r\nsuch-like. And when it come to character, warn\'t it Compeyson as had\r\nbeen to the school, and warn\'t it his schoolfellows as was in this\r\nposition and in that, and warn\'t it him as had been know\'d by witnesses\r\nin such clubs and societies, and nowt to his disadvantage? And warn\'t it\r\nme as had been tried afore, and as had been know\'d up hill and down dale\r\nin Bridewells and Lock-Ups! And when it come to speech-making, warn\'t it\r\nCompeyson as could speak to \'em wi\' his face dropping every now and then\r\ninto his white pocket-handkercher,--ah! and wi\' verses in his speech,\r\ntoo,--and warn\'t it me as could only say, \'Gentlemen, this man at my\r\nside is a most precious rascal\'? And when the verdict come, warn\'t it\r\nCompeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and\r\nbad company, and giving up all the information he could agen me,\r\nand warn\'t it me as got never a word but Guilty? And when I says to\r\nCompeyson, \'Once out of this court, I\'ll smash that face of yourn!\'\r\nain\'t it Compeyson as prays the Judge to be protected, and gets two\r\nturnkeys stood betwixt us? And when we\'re sentenced, ain\'t it him as\r\ngets seven year, and me fourteen, and ain\'t it him as the Judge is\r\nsorry for, because he might a done so well, and ain\'t it me as the Judge\r\nperceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion, likely to come to\r\nworse?"\r\n\r\nHe had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he checked\r\nit, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretching\r\nout his hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, "I ain\'t a going\r\nto be low, dear boy!"\r\n\r\nHe had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his\r\nface and head and neck and hands, before he could go on.\r\n\r\n"I had said to Compeyson that I\'d smash that face of his, and I swore\r\nLord smash mine! to do it. We was in the same prison-ship, but I\r\ncouldn\'t get at him for long, though I tried. At last I come behind him\r\nand hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at\r\nhim, when I was seen and seized. The black-hole of that ship warn\'t\r\na strong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive. I\r\nescaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there, envying\r\nthem as was in \'em and all over, when I first see my boy!"\r\n\r\nHe regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent\r\nto me again, though I had felt great pity for him.\r\n\r\n"By my boy, I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them marshes\r\ntoo. Upon my soul, I half believe he escaped in his terror, to get quit\r\nof me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore. I hunted him down. I\r\nsmashed his face. \'And now,\' says I \'as the worst thing I can do, caring\r\nnothing for myself, I\'ll drag you back.\' And I\'d have swum off, towing\r\nhim by the hair, if it had come to that, and I\'d a got him aboard\r\nwithout the soldiers.\r\n\r\n"Of course he\'d much the best of it to the last,--his character was so\r\ngood. He had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous\r\nintentions; and his punishment was light. I was put in irons, brought\r\nto trial again, and sent for life. I didn\'t stop for life, dear boy and\r\nPip\'s comrade, being here."\r\n\r\nHe wiped himself again, as he had done before, and then slowly took\r\nhis tangle of tobacco from his pocket, and plucked his pipe from his\r\nbutton-hole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke.\r\n\r\n"Is he dead?" I asked, after a silence.\r\n\r\n"Is who dead, dear boy?"\r\n\r\n"Compeyson."\r\n\r\n"He hopes I am, if he\'s alive, you may be sure," with a fierce look. "I\r\nnever heerd no more of him."\r\n\r\nHerbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book. He\r\nsoftly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with his eyes\r\non the fire, and I read in it:--\r\n\r\n"Young Havisham\'s name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professed to\r\nbe Miss Havisham\'s lover."\r\n\r\nI shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert, and put the book by; but\r\nwe neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as he stood\r\nsmoking by the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIII\r\n\r\nWhy should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might be\r\ntraced to Estella? Why should I loiter on my road, to compare the state\r\nof mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison\r\nbefore meeting her at the coach-office, with the state of mind in which\r\nI now reflected on the abyss between Estella in her pride and beauty,\r\nand the returned transport whom I harbored? The road would be none the\r\nsmoother for it, the end would be none the better for it, he would not\r\nbe helped, nor I extenuated.\r\n\r\nA new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative; or rather,\r\nhis narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already\r\nthere. If Compeyson were alive and should discover his return, I could\r\nhardly doubt the consequence. That Compeyson stood in mortal fear of\r\nhim, neither of the two could know much better than I; and that any\r\nsuch man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release\r\nhimself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an\r\ninformer was scarcely to be imagined.\r\n\r\nNever had I breathed, and never would I breathe--or so I resolved--a\r\nword of Estella to Provis. But, I said to Herbert that, before I could\r\ngo abroad, I must see both Estella and Miss Havisham. This was when we\r\nwere left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us his story. I\r\nresolved to go out to Richmond next day, and I went.\r\n\r\nOn my presenting myself at Mrs. Brandley\'s, Estella\'s maid was called to\r\ntell that Estella had gone into the country. Where? To Satis House, as\r\nusual. Not as usual, I said, for she had never yet gone there without\r\nme; when was she coming back? There was an air of reservation in the\r\nanswer which increased my perplexity, and the answer was, that her maid\r\nbelieved she was only coming back at all for a little while. I could\r\nmake nothing of this, except that it was meant that I should make\r\nnothing of it, and I went home again in complete discomfiture.\r\n\r\nAnother night consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone home (I\r\nalways took him home, and always looked well about me), led us to the\r\nconclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came\r\nback from Miss Havisham\'s. In the mean time, Herbert and I were to\r\nconsider separately what it would be best to say; whether we should\r\ndevise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious\r\nobservation; or whether I, who had never yet been abroad, should propose\r\nan expedition. We both knew that I had but to propose anything, and he\r\nwould consent. We agreed that his remaining many days in his present\r\nhazard was not to be thought of.\r\n\r\nNext day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise\r\nto go down to Joe; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joe\r\nor his name. Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone, and\r\nHerbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken. I was to be\r\nabsent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his\r\nimpatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to\r\nbe begun. It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to\r\nHerbert also, that he might be best got away across the water, on that\r\npretence,--as, to make purchases, or the like.\r\n\r\nHaving thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham\'s, I set\r\noff by the early morning coach before it was yet light, and was out\r\non the open country road when the day came creeping on, halting and\r\nwhimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of\r\nmist, like a beggar. When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly\r\nride, whom should I see come out under the gateway, toothpick in hand,\r\nto look at the coach, but Bentley Drummle!\r\n\r\nAs he pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him. It was a very\r\nlame pretence on both sides; the lamer, because we both went into the\r\ncoffee-room, where he had just finished his breakfast, and where I\r\nordered mine. It was poisonous to me to see him in the town, for I very\r\nwell knew why he had come there.\r\n\r\nPretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which had\r\nnothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of\r\ncoffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with which\r\nit was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highly\r\nirregular form, I sat at my table while he stood before the fire. By\r\ndegrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the\r\nfire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put my\r\nhand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to\r\nstir the fire, but still pretended not to know him.\r\n\r\n"Is this a cut?" said Mr. Drummle.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said I, poker in hand; "it\'s you, is it? How do you do? I was\r\nwondering who it was, who kept the fire off."\r\n\r\nWith that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myself side\r\nby side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the fire.\r\n\r\n"You have just come down?" said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little away\r\nwith his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said I, edging him a little away with my shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Beastly place," said Drummle. "Your part of the country, I think?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I assented. "I am told it\'s very like your Shropshire."\r\n\r\n"Not in the least like it," said Drummle.\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr.\r\nDrummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his.\r\n\r\n"Have you been here long?" I asked, determined not to yield an inch of\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n"Long enough to be tired of it," returned Drummle, pretending to yawn,\r\nbut equally determined.\r\n\r\n"Do you stay here long?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t say," answered Mr. Drummle. "Do you?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t say," said I.\r\n\r\nI felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle\'s\r\nshoulder had claimed another hair\'s breadth of room, I should have\r\njerked him into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urged a\r\nsimilar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box. He\r\nwhistled a little. So did I.\r\n\r\n"Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?" said Drummle.\r\n\r\n"Yes. What of that?" said I.\r\n\r\nMr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, "Oh!" and\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n"Are you amused, Mr. Drummle?"\r\n\r\n"No," said he, "not particularly. I am going out for a ride in the\r\nsaddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement. Out-of-the-way\r\nvillages there, they tell me. Curious little public-houses--and\r\nsmithies--and that. Waiter!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Is that horse of mine ready?"\r\n\r\n"Brought round to the door, sir."\r\n\r\n"I say. Look here, you sir. The lady won\'t ride to-day; the weather\r\nwon\'t do."\r\n\r\n"Very good, sir."\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t dine, because I\'m going to dine at the lady\'s."\r\n\r\n"Very good, sir."\r\n\r\nThen, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his\r\ngreat-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and so\r\nexasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms (as the\r\nrobber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady) and seat\r\nhim on the fire.\r\n\r\nOne thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief\r\ncame, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood, well\r\nsquared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our\r\nhands behind us, not budging an inch. The horse was visible outside in\r\nthe drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle\'s\r\nwas cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both\r\nstood our ground.\r\n\r\n"Have you been to the Grove since?" said Drummle.\r\n\r\n"No," said I, "I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Was that when we had a difference of opinion?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I replied, very shortly.\r\n\r\n"Come, come! They let you off easily enough," sneered Drummle. "You\r\nshouldn\'t have lost your temper."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Drummle," said I, "you are not competent to give advice on that\r\nsubject. When I lose my temper (not that I admit having done so on that\r\noccasion), I don\'t throw glasses."\r\n\r\n"I do," said Drummle.\r\n\r\nAfter glancing at him once or twice, in an increased state of\r\nsmouldering ferocity, I said,--\r\n\r\n"Mr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don\'t think it an\r\nagreeable one."\r\n\r\n"I am sure it\'s not," said he, superciliously over his shoulder; "I\r\ndon\'t think anything about it."\r\n\r\n"And therefore," I went on, "with your leave, I will suggest that we\r\nhold no kind of communication in future."\r\n\r\n"Quite my opinion," said Drummle, "and what I should have suggested\r\nmyself, or done--more likely--without suggesting. But don\'t lose your\r\ntemper. Haven\'t you lost enough without that?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Waiter!" said Drummle, by way of answering me.\r\n\r\nThe waiter reappeared.\r\n\r\n"Look here, you sir. You quite understand that the young lady don\'t ride\r\nto-day, and that I dine at the young lady\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Quite so, sir!"\r\n\r\nWhen the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his\r\nhand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle,\r\ncareful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his pocket\r\nand bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring. Choking and\r\nboiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, without\r\nintroducing Estella\'s name, which I could not endure to hear him utter;\r\nand therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were\r\nno one present, and forced myself to silence. How long we might have\r\nremained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but\r\nfor the incursion of three thriving farmers--laid on by the waiter, I\r\nthink--who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats and\r\nrubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, we\r\nwere obliged to give way.\r\n\r\nI saw him through the window, seizing his horse\'s mane, and mounting in\r\nhis blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away. I thought\r\nhe was gone, when he came back, calling for a light for the cigar in his\r\nmouth, which he had forgotten. A man in a dust-colored dress appeared\r\nwith what was wanted,--I could not have said from where: whether from\r\nthe inn yard, or the street, or where not,--and as Drummle leaned down\r\nfrom the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed, with a jerk of his\r\nhead towards the coffee-room windows, the slouching shoulders and ragged\r\nhair of this man whose back was towards me reminded me of Orlick.\r\n\r\nToo heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or\r\nno, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the\r\njourney from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house\r\nthat it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered,\r\nnever to have seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIV\r\n\r\nIn the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax-candles\r\nburnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; Miss Havisham\r\nseated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at her feet.\r\nEstella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on. They both raised\r\ntheir eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me. I derived\r\nthat, from the look they interchanged.\r\n\r\n"And what wind," said Miss Havisham, "blows you here, Pip?"\r\n\r\nThough she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.\r\nEstella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, and\r\nthen going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, as\r\nplainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceived I\r\nhad discovered my real benefactor.\r\n\r\n"Miss Havisham," said I, "I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to\r\nEstella; and finding that some wind had blown her here, I followed."\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down,\r\nI took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen her\r\noccupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural\r\nplace for me, that day.\r\n\r\n"What I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before you,\r\npresently--in a few moments. It will not surprise you, it will not\r\ndisplease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be."\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham continued to look steadily at me. I could see in the\r\naction of Estella\'s fingers as they worked that she attended to what I\r\nsaid; but she did not look up.\r\n\r\n"I have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery,\r\nand is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune,\r\nanything. There are reasons why I must say no more of that. It is not my\r\nsecret, but another\'s."\r\n\r\nAs I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering how to\r\ngo on, Miss Havisham repeated, "It is not your secret, but another\'s.\r\nWell?"\r\n\r\n"When you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham, when I\r\nbelonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left,\r\nI suppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might have\r\ncome,--as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paid\r\nfor it?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, Pip," replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head; "you did."\r\n\r\n"And that Mr. Jaggers--"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Jaggers," said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, "had\r\nnothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it. His being my lawyer, and\r\nhis being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence. He holds the same\r\nrelation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise. Be that\r\nas it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one."\r\n\r\nAny one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no\r\nsuppression or evasion so far.\r\n\r\n"But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least\r\nyou led me on?" said I.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she returned, again nodding steadily, "I let you go on."\r\n\r\n"Was that kind?"\r\n\r\n"Who am I," cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the floor\r\nand flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in\r\nsurprise,--"who am I, for God\'s sake, that I should be kind?"\r\n\r\nIt was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it. I\r\ntold her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, well!" she said. "What else?"\r\n\r\n"I was liberally paid for my old attendance here," I said, to soothe\r\nher, "in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for\r\nmy own information. What follows has another (and I hope more\r\ndisinterested) purpose. In humoring my mistake, Miss Havisham, you\r\npunished--practised on--perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses\r\nyour intention, without offence--your self-seeking relations?"\r\n\r\n"I did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has been my\r\nhistory, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you\r\nnot to have it so! You made your own snares. I never made them."\r\n\r\nWaiting until she was quiet again,--for this, too, flashed out of her in\r\na wild and sudden way,--I went on.\r\n\r\n"I have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham,\r\nand have been constantly among them since I went to London. I know them\r\nto have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself. And I should be\r\nfalse and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to you or\r\nno, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, that you\r\ndeeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert, if you suppose\r\nthem to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, and incapable of\r\nanything designing or mean."\r\n\r\n"They are your friends," said Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n"They made themselves my friends," said I, "when they supposed me\r\nto have superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket, Miss Georgiana, and\r\nMistress Camilla were not my friends, I think."\r\n\r\nThis contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do\r\nthem good with her. She looked at me keenly for a little while, and then\r\nsaid quietly,--\r\n\r\n"What do you want for them?"\r\n\r\n"Only," said I, "that you would not confound them with the others. They\r\nmay be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the same\r\nnature."\r\n\r\nStill looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,--\r\n\r\n"What do you want for them?"\r\n\r\n"I am not so cunning, you see," I said, in answer, conscious that I\r\nreddened a little, "as that I could hide from you, even if I desired,\r\nthat I do want something. Miss Havisham, if you would spare the money\r\nto do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from the\r\nnature of the case must be done without his knowledge, I could show you\r\nhow."\r\n\r\n"Why must it be done without his knowledge?" she asked, settling her\r\nhands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more attentively.\r\n\r\n"Because," said I, "I began the service myself, more than two years ago,\r\nwithout his knowledge, and I don\'t want to be betrayed. Why I fail in my\r\nability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of the secret which\r\nis another person\'s and not mine."\r\n\r\nShe gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.\r\nAfter watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light\r\nof the slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by\r\nthe collapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again--at\r\nfirst, vacantly--then, with a gradually concentrating attention. All\r\nthis time Estella knitted on. When Miss Havisham had fixed her\r\nattention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been no lapse in our\r\ndialogue,--\r\n\r\n"What else?"\r\n\r\n"Estella," said I, turning to her now, and trying to command my\r\ntrembling voice, "you know I love you. You know that I have loved you\r\nlong and dearly."\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her fingers\r\nplied their work, and she looked at me with an unmoved countenance. I\r\nsaw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and from her to me.\r\n\r\n"I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It induced me\r\nto hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another. While I thought you\r\ncould not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it. But I\r\nmust say it now."\r\n\r\nPreserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still going,\r\nEstella shook her head.\r\n\r\n"I know," said I, in answer to that action,--"I know. I have no hope\r\nthat I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may become\r\nof me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, I love\r\nyou. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house."\r\n\r\nLooking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she shook her\r\nhead again.\r\n\r\n"It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practise\r\non the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through all these\r\nyears with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she had reflected on the\r\ngravity of what she did. But I think she did not. I think that, in the\r\nendurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella."\r\n\r\nI saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, as she\r\nsat looking by turns at Estella and at me.\r\n\r\n"It seems," said Estella, very calmly, "that there are sentiments,\r\nfancies,--I don\'t know how to call them,--which I am not able to\r\ncomprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form\r\nof words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast, you touch\r\nnothing there. I don\'t care for what you say at all. I have tried to\r\nwarn you of this; now, have I not?"\r\n\r\nI said in a miserable manner, "Yes."\r\n\r\n"Yes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.\r\nNow, did you not think so?"\r\n\r\n"I thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, untried, and\r\nbeautiful, Estella! Surely it is not in Nature."\r\n\r\n"It is in my nature," she returned. And then she added, with a stress\r\nupon the words, "It is in the nature formed within me. I make a great\r\ndifference between you and all other people when I say so much. I can do\r\nno more."\r\n\r\n"Is it not true," said I, "that Bentley Drummle is in town here, and\r\npursuing you?"\r\n\r\n"It is quite true," she replied, referring to him with the indifference\r\nof utter contempt.\r\n\r\n"That you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he dines with\r\nyou this very day?"\r\n\r\nShe seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied,\r\n"Quite true."\r\n\r\n"You cannot love him, Estella!"\r\n\r\nHer fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather angrily,\r\n"What have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do not\r\nmean what I say?"\r\n\r\n"You would never marry him, Estella?"\r\n\r\nShe looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her\r\nwork in her hands. Then she said, "Why not tell you the truth? I am\r\ngoing to be married to him."\r\n\r\nI dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better\r\nthan I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear\r\nher say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such a\r\nghastly look upon Miss Havisham\'s, that it impressed me, even in my\r\npassionate hurry and grief.\r\n\r\n"Estella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this\r\nfatal step. Put me aside for ever,--you have done so, I well know,--but\r\nbestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havisham\r\ngives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done\r\nto the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly\r\nlove you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly,\r\nthough he has not loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I can bear it\r\nbetter, for your sake!"\r\n\r\nMy earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have\r\nbeen touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all\r\nintelligible to her own mind.\r\n\r\n"I am going," she said again, in a gentler voice, "to be married to\r\nhim. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be\r\nmarried soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by\r\nadoption? It is my own act."\r\n\r\n"Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?"\r\n\r\n"On whom should I fling myself away?" she retorted, with a smile.\r\n"Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel (if\r\npeople do feel such things) that I took nothing to him? There! It is\r\ndone. I shall do well enough, and so will my husband. As to leading\r\nme into what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had me\r\nwait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, which\r\nhas very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it. Say no\r\nmore. We shall never understand each other."\r\n\r\n"Such a mean brute, such a stupid brute!" I urged, in despair.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be afraid of my being a blessing to him," said Estella; "I shall\r\nnot be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you visionary\r\nboy--or man?"\r\n\r\n"O Estella!" I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, do\r\nwhat I would to restrain them; "even if I remained in England and could\r\nhold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle\'s wife?"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," she returned,--"nonsense. This will pass in no time."\r\n\r\n"Never, Estella!"\r\n\r\n"You will get me out of your thoughts in a week."\r\n\r\n"Out of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. You\r\nhave been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the\r\nrough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been\r\nin every prospect I have ever seen since,--on the river, on the sails of\r\nthe ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the darkness,\r\nin the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You have been\r\nthe embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become\r\nacquainted with. The stones of which the strongest London buildings\r\nare made are not more real, or more impossible to be displaced by your\r\nhands, than your presence and influence have been to me, there and\r\neverywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of my life, you\r\ncannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the little good\r\nin me, part of the evil. But, in this separation, I associate you only\r\nwith the good; and I will faithfully hold you to that always, for you\r\nmust have done me far more good than harm, let me feel now what sharp\r\ndistress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!"\r\n\r\nIn what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself, I\r\ndon\'t know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood from an\r\ninward wound, and gushed out. I held her hand to my lips some lingering\r\nmoments, and so I left her. But ever afterwards, I remembered,--and soon\r\nafterwards with stronger reason,--that while Estella looked at me merely\r\nwith incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her hand\r\nstill covering her heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of\r\npity and remorse.\r\n\r\nAll done, all gone! So much was done and gone, that when I went out at\r\nthe gate, the light of the day seemed of a darker color than when I went\r\nin. For a while, I hid myself among some lanes and by-paths, and then\r\nstruck off to walk all the way to London. For, I had by that time come\r\nto myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to the inn and\r\nsee Drummle there; that I could not bear to sit upon the coach and\r\nbe spoken to; that I could do nothing half so good for myself as tire\r\nmyself out.\r\n\r\nIt was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge. Pursuing the narrow\r\nintricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the\r\nMiddlesex shore of the river, my readiest access to the Temple was\r\nclose by the river-side, through Whitefriars. I was not expected till\r\nto-morrow; but I had my keys, and, if Herbert were gone to bed, could\r\nget to bed myself without disturbing him.\r\n\r\nAs it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after the\r\nTemple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, I did not take it\r\nill that the night-porter examined me with much attention as he held the\r\ngate a little way open for me to pass in. To help his memory I mentioned\r\nmy name.\r\n\r\n"I was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so. Here\'s a note, sir. The\r\nmessenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my\r\nlantern?"\r\n\r\nMuch surprised by the request, I took the note. It was directed to\r\nPhilip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were the\r\nwords, "PLEASE READ THIS, HERE." I opened it, the watchman holding up\r\nhis light, and read inside, in Wemmick\'s writing,--\r\n\r\n"DON\'T GO HOME."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLV\r\n\r\nTurning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I made\r\nthe best of my way to Fleet Street, and there got a late hackney chariot\r\nand drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden. In those times a bed was\r\nalways to be got there at any hour of the night, and the chamberlain,\r\nletting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the candle next in order on\r\nhis shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his\r\nlist. It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back, with a\r\ndespotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddling over the\r\nwhole place, putting one of his arbitrary legs into the fireplace\r\nand another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretched little\r\nwashing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner.\r\n\r\nAs I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in,\r\nbefore he left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of those\r\nvirtuous days--an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which\r\ninstantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever be\r\nlighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom\r\nof a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a staringly\r\nwide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed, and lay there\r\nfootsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more close my own\r\neyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus. And thus, in the\r\ngloom and death of the night, we stared at one another.\r\n\r\nWhat a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was an\r\ninhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I\r\nlooked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what\r\na number of blue-bottle flies from the butchers\', and earwigs from the\r\nmarket, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying\r\nby for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever\r\ntumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,--a\r\ndisagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable\r\napproaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those\r\nextraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves\r\naudible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little\r\nwashing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the\r\nchest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired\r\na new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw\r\nwritten, DON\'T GO HOME.\r\n\r\nWhatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never warded\r\noff this DON\'T GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I thought of,\r\nas a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had read in the\r\nnewspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums in the\r\nnight, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had been\r\nfound in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that he\r\nmust have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to\r\nassure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door\r\nto look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship\r\nof a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But\r\nall this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,\r\nand when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were\r\nquestions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed\r\nthere could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I\r\nthought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when\r\nI recalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and\r\ntones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,--even then I\r\nwas pursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Don\'t go home.\r\nWhen at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became\r\na vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present\r\ntense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, do\r\nnot ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially: I may not\r\nand I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and should\r\nnot go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and rolled over\r\non the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again.\r\n\r\nI had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was plain\r\nthat I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally plain\r\nthat this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments only could be\r\ntaken. It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been\r\nso miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door to startle me\r\nfrom my uneasy bed.\r\n\r\nThe Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o\'clock. The little\r\nservant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls, I\r\npassed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company,\r\nand so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as he was\r\nmaking tea for himself and the Aged. An open door afforded a perspective\r\nview of the Aged in bed.\r\n\r\n"Halloa, Mr. Pip!" said Wemmick. "You did come home, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I returned; "but I didn\'t go home."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," said he, rubbing his hands. "I left a note for you\r\nat each of the Temple gates, on the chance. Which gate did you come to?"\r\n\r\nI told him.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the\r\nnotes," said Wemmick; "it\'s a good rule never to leave documentary\r\nevidence if you can help it, because you don\'t know when it may be put\r\nin. I\'m going to take a liberty with you. Would you mind toasting this\r\nsausage for the Aged P.?"\r\n\r\nI said I should be delighted to do it.\r\n\r\n"Then you can go about your work, Mary Anne," said Wemmick to the little\r\nservant; "which leaves us to ourselves, don\'t you see, Mr. Pip?" he\r\nadded, winking, as she disappeared.\r\n\r\nI thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourse\r\nproceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged\'s sausage and he\r\nbuttered the crumb of the Aged\'s roll.\r\n\r\n"Now, Mr. Pip, you know," said Wemmick, "you and I understand one\r\nanother. We are in our private and personal capacities, and we have been\r\nengaged in a confidential transaction before to-day. Official sentiments\r\nare one thing. We are extra official."\r\n\r\nI cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted\r\nthe Aged\'s sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.\r\n\r\n"I accidentally heard, yesterday morning," said Wemmick, "being in a\r\ncertain place where I once took you,--even between you and me, it\'s as\r\nwell not to mention names when avoidable--"\r\n\r\n"Much better not," said I. "I understand you."\r\n\r\n"I heard there by chance, yesterday morning," said Wemmick, "that\r\na certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not\r\nunpossessed of portable property,--I don\'t know who it may really\r\nbe,--we won\'t name this person--"\r\n\r\n"Not necessary," said I.\r\n\r\n"--Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good\r\nmany people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations,\r\nand not quite irrespective of the government expense--"\r\n\r\nIn watching his face, I made quite a firework of the Aged\'s sausage,\r\nand greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick\'s; for which I\r\napologized.\r\n\r\n"--By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of\r\nthereabouts. From which," said Wemmick, "conjectures had been raised and\r\ntheories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden Court,\r\nTemple, had been watched, and might be watched again."\r\n\r\n"By whom?" said I.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t go into that," said Wemmick, evasively, "it might clash with\r\nofficial responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time heard other\r\ncurious things in the same place. I don\'t tell it you on information\r\nreceived. I heard it."\r\n\r\nHe took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he spoke, and set forth\r\nthe Aged\'s breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to placing it\r\nbefore him, he went into the Aged\'s room with a clean white cloth, and\r\ntied the same under the old gentleman\'s chin, and propped him up, and\r\nput his nightcap on one side, and gave him quite a rakish air. Then he\r\nplaced his breakfast before him with great care, and said, "All right,\r\nain\'t you, Aged P.?" To which the cheerful Aged replied, "All right,\r\nJohn, my boy, all right!" As there seemed to be a tacit understanding\r\nthat the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was therefore to be\r\nconsidered invisible, I made a pretence of being in complete ignorance\r\nof these proceedings.\r\n\r\n"This watching of me at my chambers (which I have once had reason to\r\nsuspect)," I said to Wemmick when he came back, "is inseparable from the\r\nperson to whom you have adverted; is it?"\r\n\r\nWemmick looked very serious. "I couldn\'t undertake to say that, of my\r\nown knowledge. I mean, I couldn\'t undertake to say it was at first. But\r\nit either is, or it will be, or it\'s in great danger of being."\r\n\r\nAs I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying\r\nas much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far out\r\nof his way he went to say what he did, I could not press him. But I told\r\nhim, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to ask\r\nhim a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as he\r\ndeemed right, and sure that his course would be right. He paused in his\r\nbreakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves (his\r\nnotion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to me\r\nonce, to put my question.\r\n\r\n"You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is\r\nCompeyson?"\r\n\r\nHe answered with one other nod.\r\n\r\n"Is he living?"\r\n\r\nOne other nod.\r\n\r\n"Is he in London?"\r\n\r\nHe gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave\r\nme one last nod, and went on with his breakfast.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Wemmick, "questioning being over," which he emphasized and\r\nrepeated for my guidance, "I come to what I did, after hearing what I\r\nheard. I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to\r\nClarriker\'s to find Mr. Herbert."\r\n\r\n"And him you found?" said I, with great anxiety.\r\n\r\n"And him I found. Without mentioning any names or going into any\r\ndetails, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody--Tom,\r\nJack, or Richard--being about the chambers, or about the immediate\r\nneighborhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the way\r\nwhile you were out of the way."\r\n\r\n"He would be greatly puzzled what to do?"\r\n\r\n"He was puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him my opinion\r\nthat it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard too far out\r\nof the way at present. Mr. Pip, I\'ll tell you something. Under existing\r\ncircumstances, there is no place like a great city when you are once\r\nin it. Don\'t break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things slacken,\r\nbefore you try the open, even for foreign air."\r\n\r\nI thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Herbert had\r\ndone?\r\n\r\n"Mr. Herbert," said Wemmick, "after being all of a heap for half an\r\nhour, struck out a plan. He mentioned to me as a secret, that he is\r\ncourting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden\r\nPa. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a\r\nbow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river. You\r\nare acquainted with the young lady, most probably?"\r\n\r\n"Not personally," said I.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion\r\nwho did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to\r\npresent me to her, she had received the proposal with such very moderate\r\nwarmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of\r\nthe case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time before I made\r\nher acquaintance. When I had begun to advance Herbert\'s prospects by\r\nstealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy: he and\r\nhis affianced, for their part, had naturally not been very anxious to\r\nintroduce a third person into their interviews; and thus, although I was\r\nassured that I had risen in Clara\'s esteem, and although the young\r\nlady and I had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by\r\nHerbert, I had never seen her. However, I did not trouble Wemmick with\r\nthese particulars.\r\n\r\n"The house with the bow-window," said Wemmick, "being by the river-side,\r\ndown the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and being kept, it\r\nseems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to\r\nlet, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that as a temporary\r\ntenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard? Now, I thought very well of it, for\r\nthree reasons I\'ll give you. That is to say: Firstly. It\'s altogether\r\nout of all your beats, and is well away from the usual heap of streets\r\ngreat and small. Secondly. Without going near it yourself, you could\r\nalways hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard, through Mr. Herbert.\r\nThirdly. After a while and when it might be prudent, if you should want\r\nto slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a foreign packet-boat, there he\r\nis--ready."\r\n\r\nMuch comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and\r\nagain, and begged him to proceed.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will, and\r\nby nine o\'clock last night he housed Tom, Jack, or Richard,--whichever\r\nit may be,--you and I don\'t want to know,--quite successfully. At the\r\nold lodgings it was understood that he was summoned to Dover, and, in\r\nfact, he was taken down the Dover road and cornered out of it. Now,\r\nanother great advantage of all this is, that it was done without you,\r\nand when, if any one was concerning himself about your movements, you\r\nmust be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged.\r\nThis diverts suspicion and confuses it; and for the same reason I\r\nrecommended that, even if you came back last night, you should not go\r\nhome. It brings in more confusion, and you want confusion."\r\n\r\nWemmick, having finished his breakfast, here looked at his watch, and\r\nbegan to get his coat on.\r\n\r\n"And now, Mr. Pip," said he, with his hands still in the sleeves, "I\r\nhave probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more,--from\r\na Walworth point of view, and in a strictly private and personal\r\ncapacity,--I shall be glad to do it. Here\'s the address. There can be\r\nno harm in your going here to-night, and seeing for yourself that all is\r\nwell with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home,--which is another\r\nreason for your not going home last night. But, after you have gone\r\nhome, don\'t go back here. You are very welcome, I am sure, Mr. Pip"; his\r\nhands were now out of his sleeves, and I was shaking them; "and let me\r\nfinally impress one important point upon you." He laid his hands upon\r\nmy shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper: "Avail yourself of this\r\nevening to lay hold of his portable property. You don\'t know what may\r\nhappen to him. Don\'t let anything happen to the portable property."\r\n\r\nQuite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, I\r\nforbore to try.\r\n\r\n"Time\'s up," said Wemmick, "and I must be off. If you had nothing more\r\npressing to do than to keep here till dark, that\'s what I should advise.\r\nYou look very much worried, and it would do you good to have a perfectly\r\nquiet day with the Aged,--he\'ll be up presently,--and a little bit\r\nof--you remember the pig?"\r\n\r\n"Of course," said I.\r\n\r\n"Well; and a little bit of him. That sausage you toasted was his, and\r\nhe was in all respects a first-rater. Do try him, if it is only for old\r\nacquaintance sake. Good-bye, Aged Parent!" in a cheery shout.\r\n\r\n"All right, John; all right, my boy!" piped the old man from within.\r\n\r\nI soon fell asleep before Wemmick\'s fire, and the Aged and I enjoyed one\r\nanother\'s society by falling asleep before it more or less all day.\r\nWe had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the estate; and\r\nI nodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do it\r\ndrowsily. When it was quite dark, I left the Aged preparing the fire for\r\ntoast; and I inferred from the number of teacups, as well as from his\r\nglances at the two little doors in the wall, that Miss Skiffins was\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVI\r\n\r\nEight o\'clock had struck before I got into the air, that was scented,\r\nnot disagreeably, by the chips and shavings of the long-shore\r\nboat-builders, and mast, oar, and block makers. All that water-side\r\nregion of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge was unknown ground to\r\nme; and when I struck down by the river, I found that the spot I wanted\r\nwas not where I had supposed it to be, and was anything but easy to\r\nfind. It was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinks\'s Basin; and I had no other\r\nguide to Chinks\'s Basin than the Old Green Copper Rope-walk.\r\n\r\nIt matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myself\r\namong, what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces,\r\nwhat ooze and slime and other dregs of tide, what yards of ship-builders\r\nand ship-breakers, what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground,\r\nthough for years off duty, what mountainous country of accumulated casks\r\nand timber, how many rope-walks that were not the Old Green Copper. After\r\nseveral times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting\r\nit, I came unexpectedly round a corner, upon Mill Pond Bank. It was a\r\nfresh kind of place, all circumstances considered, where the wind from\r\nthe river had room to turn itself round; and there were two or three\r\ntrees in it, and there was the stump of a ruined windmill, and there\r\nwas the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,--whose long and narrow vista I could\r\ntrace in the moonlight, along a series of wooden frames set in the\r\nground, that looked like superannuated haymaking-rakes which had grown\r\nold and lost most of their teeth.\r\n\r\nSelecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank a house with a\r\nwooden front and three stories of bow-window (not bay-window, which is\r\nanother thing), I looked at the plate upon the door, and read there,\r\nMrs. Whimple. That being the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderly\r\nwoman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded. She was\r\nimmediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who silently led me into\r\nthe parlor and shut the door. It was an odd sensation to see his very\r\nfamiliar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room\r\nand region; and I found myself looking at him, much as I looked at\r\nthe corner-cupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon the\r\nchimney-piece, and the colored engravings on the wall, representing the\r\ndeath of Captain Cook, a ship-launch, and his Majesty King George the\r\nThird in a state coachman\'s wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots, on the\r\nterrace at Windsor.\r\n\r\n"All is well, Handel," said Herbert, "and he is quite satisfied, though\r\neager to see you. My dear girl is with her father; and if you\'ll wait\r\ntill she comes down, I\'ll make you known to her, and then we\'ll go upstairs.\r\nThat\'s her father."\r\n\r\nI had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had probably\r\nexpressed the fact in my countenance.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid he is a sad old rascal," said Herbert, smiling, "but I have\r\nnever seen him. Don\'t you smell rum? He is always at it."\r\n\r\n"At rum?" said I.\r\n\r\n"Yes," returned Herbert, "and you may suppose how mild it makes his\r\ngout. He persists, too, in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his\r\nroom, and serving them out. He keeps them on shelves over his head, and\r\nwill weigh them all. His room must be like a chandler\'s shop."\r\n\r\nWhile he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and\r\nthen died away.\r\n\r\n"What else can be the consequence," said Herbert, in explanation, "if\r\nhe will cut the cheese? A man with the gout in his right hand--and\r\neverywhere else--can\'t expect to get through a Double Gloucester without\r\nhurting himself."\r\n\r\nHe seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he gave another furious\r\nroar.\r\n\r\n"To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs. Whimple,"\r\nsaid Herbert, "for of course people in general won\'t stand that noise. A\r\ncurious place, Handel; isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nIt was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and clean.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Whimple," said Herbert, when I told him so, "is the best of\r\nhousewives, and I really do not know what my Clara would do without\r\nher motherly help. For, Clara has no mother of her own, Handel, and no\r\nrelation in the world but old Gruffandgrim."\r\n\r\n"Surely that\'s not his name, Herbert?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Herbert, "that\'s my name for him. His name is Mr. Barley.\r\nBut what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a\r\ngirl who has no relations, and who can never bother herself or anybody\r\nelse about her family!"\r\n\r\nHerbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that he\r\nfirst knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education at\r\nan establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her being recalled home\r\nto nurse her father, he and she had confided their affection to the\r\nmotherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated\r\nwith equal kindness and discretion, ever since. It was understood that\r\nnothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by\r\nreason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject\r\nmore psychological than Gout, Rum, and Purser\'s stores.\r\n\r\nAs we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley\'s sustained\r\ngrowl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room door\r\nopened, and a very pretty, slight, dark-eyed girl of twenty or so came\r\nin with a basket in her hand: whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the\r\nbasket, and presented, blushing, as "Clara." She really was a most\r\ncharming girl, and might have passed for a captive fairy, whom that\r\ntruculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his service.\r\n\r\n"Look here," said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionate\r\nand tender smile, after we had talked a little; "here\'s poor Clara\'s\r\nsupper, served out every night. Here\'s her allowance of bread, and\r\nhere\'s her slice of cheese, and here\'s her rum,--which I drink. This\r\nis Mr. Barley\'s breakfast for to-morrow, served out to be cooked. Two\r\nmutton-chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, two\r\nounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper. It\'s\r\nstewed up together, and taken hot, and it\'s a nice thing for the gout, I\r\nshould think!"\r\n\r\nThere was something so natural and winning in Clara\'s resigned way of\r\nlooking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out; and\r\nsomething so confiding, loving, and innocent in her modest manner of\r\nyielding herself to Herbert\'s embracing arm; and something so gentle in\r\nher, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks\'s Basin,\r\nand the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, with Old Barley growling in the\r\nbeam,--that I would not have undone the engagement between her and\r\nHerbert for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened.\r\n\r\nI was looking at her with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly the\r\ngrowl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise was heard\r\nabove, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through\r\nthe ceiling to come at us. Upon this Clara said to Herbert, "Papa wants\r\nme, darling!" and ran away.\r\n\r\n"There is an unconscionable old shark for you!" said Herbert. "What do\r\nyou suppose he wants now, Handel?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said I. "Something to drink?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s it!" cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary\r\nmerit. "He keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table.\r\nWait a moment, and you\'ll hear Clara lift him up to take some. There\r\nhe goes!" Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the end. "Now," said\r\nHerbert, as it was succeeded by silence, "he\'s drinking. Now," said\r\nHerbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, "he\'s down again\r\non his back!"\r\n\r\nClara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me upstairs to\r\nsee our charge. As we passed Mr. Barley\'s door, he was heard hoarsely\r\nmuttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, the\r\nfollowing Refrain, in which I substitute good wishes for something quite\r\nthe reverse:--\r\n\r\n"Ahoy! Bless your eyes, here\'s old Bill Barley. Here\'s old Bill Barley,\r\nbless your eyes. Here\'s old Bill Barley on the flat of his back, by the\r\nLord. Lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder,\r\nhere\'s your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Ahoy! Bless you."\r\n\r\nIn this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible Barley\r\nwould commune with himself by the day and night together; Often, while\r\nit was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope which was\r\nfitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river.\r\n\r\nIn his two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh and\r\nairy, and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below, I found\r\nProvis comfortably settled. He expressed no alarm, and seemed to\r\nfeel none that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that he was\r\nsoftened,--indefinably, for I could not have said how, and could never\r\nafterwards recall how when I tried, but certainly.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity that the day\'s rest had given me for reflection had\r\nresulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting\r\nCompeyson. For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man\r\nmight otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own\r\ndestruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by his\r\nfire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick\'s judgment\r\nand sources of information?\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, dear boy!" he answered, with a grave nod, "Jaggers knows."\r\n\r\n"Then, I have talked with Wemmick," said I, "and have come to tell you\r\nwhat caution he gave me and what advice."\r\n\r\nThis I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I told\r\nhim how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers or\r\nprisoners I could not say), that he was under some suspicion, and that\r\nmy chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his keeping\r\nclose for a time, and my keeping away from him; and what Wemmick had\r\nsaid about getting him abroad. I added, that of course, when the time\r\ncame, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might\r\nbe safest in Wemmick\'s judgment. What was to follow that I did not touch\r\nupon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about it in my\r\nown mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and in declared\r\nperil for my sake. As to altering my way of living by enlarging my\r\nexpenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult\r\ncircumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it were no worse?\r\n\r\nHe could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. His\r\ncoming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be a\r\nventure. He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he had\r\nvery little fear of his safety with such good help.\r\n\r\nHerbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said\r\nthat something had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick\'s\r\nsuggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue. "We are both good\r\nwatermen, Handel, and could take him down the river ourselves when the\r\nright time comes. No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and no\r\nboatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chance\r\nis worth saving. Never mind the season; don\'t you think it might be a\r\ngood thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs, and\r\nwere in the habit of rowing up and down the river? You fall into that\r\nhabit, and then who notices or minds? Do it twenty or fifty times,\r\nand there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first or\r\nfifty-first."\r\n\r\nI liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. We agreed\r\nthat it should be carried into execution, and that Provis should never\r\nrecognize us if we came below Bridge, and rowed past Mill Pond Bank. But\r\nwe further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his\r\nwindow which gave upon the east, whenever he saw us and all was right.\r\n\r\nOur conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go;\r\nremarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go home together, and\r\nthat I would take half an hour\'s start of him. "I don\'t like to leave\r\nyou here," I said to Provis, "though I cannot doubt your being safer\r\nhere than near me. Good-bye!"\r\n\r\n"Dear boy," he answered, clasping my hands, "I don\'t know when we may\r\nmeet again, and I don\'t like good-bye. Say good night!"\r\n\r\n"Good night! Herbert will go regularly between us, and when the time\r\ncomes you may be certain I shall be ready. Good night, good night!"\r\n\r\nWe thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms; and we left him\r\non the landing outside his door, holding a light over the stair-rail to\r\nlight us downstairs. Looking back at him, I thought of the first night\r\nof his return, when our positions were reversed, and when I little\r\nsupposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him\r\nas it was now.\r\n\r\nOld Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door, with no\r\nappearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease. When we got to the\r\nfoot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he had preserved the name of\r\nProvis. He replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr. Campbell.\r\nHe also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell there was,\r\nthat he (Herbert) had Mr. Campbell consigned to him, and felt a strong\r\npersonal interest in his being well cared for, and living a secluded\r\nlife. So, when we went into the parlor where Mrs. Whimple and Clara were\r\nseated at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mr. Campbell, but\r\nkept it to myself.\r\n\r\nWhen I had taken leave of the pretty, gentle, dark-eyed girl, and of the\r\nmotherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little\r\naffair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Rope-walk had\r\ngrown quite a different place. Old Barley might be as old as the hills,\r\nand might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there were redeeming\r\nyouth and trust and hope enough in Chinks\'s Basin to fill it to\r\noverflowing. And then I thought of Estella, and of our parting, and went\r\nhome very sadly.\r\n\r\nAll things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them. The\r\nwindows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark\r\nand still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court. I walked past the\r\nfountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between\r\nme and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Herbert, coming to my\r\nbedside when he came in,--for I went straight to bed, dispirited and\r\nfatigued,--made the same report. Opening one of the windows after that,\r\nhe looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was as\r\nsolemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.\r\n\r\nNext day I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the boat\r\nwas brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach\r\nher within a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and\r\npractice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out in\r\ncold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been\r\nout a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the\r\nhours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was Old\r\nLondon Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there\r\nwas a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But I\r\nknew well enough how to \'shoot\' the bridge after seeing it done, and so\r\nbegan to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to Erith.\r\nThe first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were pulling a\r\npair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the blind towards\r\nthe east come down. Herbert was rarely there less frequently than three\r\ntimes in a week, and he never brought me a single word of intelligence\r\nthat was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there was cause for alarm,\r\nand I could not get rid of the notion of being watched. Once received,\r\nit is a haunting idea; how many undesigning persons I suspected of\r\nwatching me, it would be hard to calculate.\r\n\r\nIn short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding.\r\nHerbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at\r\none of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down, and to\r\nthink that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards Clara. But\r\nI thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch, and that\r\nany black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going swiftly,\r\nsilently, and surely, to take him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVII\r\n\r\nSome weeks passed without bringing any change. We waited for Wemmick,\r\nand he made no sign. If I had never known him out of Little Britain, and\r\nhad never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the\r\nCastle, I might have doubted him; not so for a moment, knowing him as I\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nMy worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressed\r\nfor money by more than one creditor. Even I myself began to know the\r\nwant of money (I mean of ready money in my own pocket), and to relieve\r\nit by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash. But\r\nI had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more\r\nmoney from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and\r\nplans. Therefore, I had sent him the unopened pocket-book by Herbert, to\r\nhold in his own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfaction--whether it\r\nwas a false kind or a true, I hardly know--in not having profited by his\r\ngenerosity since his revelation of himself.\r\n\r\nAs the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella\r\nwas married. Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but a\r\nconviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert (to whom I had\r\nconfided the circumstances of our last interview) never to speak of her\r\nto me. Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of\r\nhope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know? Why did you\r\nwho read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last\r\nyear, last month, last week?\r\n\r\nIt was an unhappy life that I lived; and its one dominant anxiety,\r\ntowering over all its other anxieties, like a high mountain above a\r\nrange of mountains, never disappeared from my view. Still, no new cause\r\nfor fear arose. Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terror\r\nfresh upon me that he was discovered; let me sit listening, as I would\r\nwith dread, for Herbert\'s returning step at night, lest it should be\r\nfleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,--for all that, and\r\nmuch more to like purpose, the round of things went on. Condemned to\r\ninaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowed\r\nabout in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.\r\n\r\nThere were states of the tide when, having been down the river, I could\r\nnot get back through the eddy-chafed arches and starlings of old London\r\nBridge; then, I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House, to be\r\nbrought up afterwards to the Temple stairs. I was not averse to doing\r\nthis, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the\r\nwater-side people there. From this slight occasion sprang two meetings\r\nthat I have now to tell of.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the wharf\r\nat dusk. I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide, and\r\nhad turned with the tide. It had been a fine bright day, but had become\r\nfoggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way back among the\r\nshipping, pretty carefully. Both in going and returning, I had seen the\r\nsignal in his window, All well.\r\n\r\nAs it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfort\r\nmyself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection and solitude\r\nbefore me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would afterwards go\r\nto the play. The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achieved his questionable\r\ntriumph was in that water-side neighborhood (it is nowhere now), and\r\nto that theatre I resolved to go. I was aware that Mr. Wopsle had\r\nnot succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the contrary, had rather\r\npartaken of its decline. He had been ominously heard of, through the\r\nplay-bills, as a faithful Black, in connection with a little girl of\r\nnoble birth, and a monkey. And Herbert had seen him as a predatory\r\nTartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red brick, and an\r\noutrageous hat all over bells.\r\n\r\nI dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop-house,\r\nwhere there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on every half-yard\r\nof the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of the knives,--to\r\nthis day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the Lord Mayor\'s\r\ndominions which is not geographical,--and wore out the time in dozing\r\nover crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of dinners. By\r\nand by, I roused myself, and went to the play.\r\n\r\nThere, I found a virtuous boatswain in His Majesty\'s service,--a most\r\nexcellent man, though I could have wished his trousers not quite so\r\ntight in some places, and not quite so loose in others,--who knocked all\r\nthe little men\'s hats over their eyes, though he was very generous and\r\nbrave, and who wouldn\'t hear of anybody\'s paying taxes, though he was\r\nvery patriotic. He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding in\r\nthe cloth, and on that property married a young person in bed-furniture,\r\nwith great rejoicings; the whole population of Portsmouth (nine in\r\nnumber at the last census) turning out on the beach to rub their own\r\nhands and shake everybody else\'s, and sing "Fill, fill!" A certain\r\ndark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn\'t fill, or do anything else\r\nthat was proposed to him, and whose heart was openly stated (by the\r\nboatswain) to be as black as his figure-head, proposed to two other\r\nSwabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was so effectually\r\ndone (the Swab family having considerable political influence) that it\r\ntook half the evening to set things right, and then it was only brought\r\nabout through an honest little grocer with a white hat, black gaiters,\r\nand red nose, getting into a clock, with a gridiron, and listening, and\r\ncoming out, and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron\r\nwhom he couldn\'t confute with what he had overheard. This led to Mr.\r\nWopsle\'s (who had never been heard of before) coming in with a star\r\nand garter on, as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the\r\nAdmiralty, to say that the Swabs were all to go to prison on the spot,\r\nand that he had brought the boatswain down the Union Jack, as a slight\r\nacknowledgment of his public services. The boatswain, unmanned for the\r\nfirst time, respectfully dried his eyes on the Jack, and then cheering\r\nup, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your Honor, solicited permission to\r\ntake him by the fin. Mr. Wopsle, conceding his fin with a gracious\r\ndignity, was immediately shoved into a dusty corner, while everybody\r\ndanced a hornpipe; and from that corner, surveying the public with a\r\ndiscontented eye, became aware of me.\r\n\r\nThe second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in\r\nthe first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected\r\nMr. Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric\r\ncountenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair, engaged\r\nin the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great\r\ncowardice when his gigantic master came home (very hoarse) to dinner.\r\nBut he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for,\r\nthe Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,--on account of\r\nthe parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice\r\nof his daughter\'s heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a\r\nflour-sack, out of the first-floor window,--summoned a sententious\r\nEnchanter; and he, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily, after\r\nan apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a high-crowned\r\nhat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm. The business\r\nof this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked at, sung at,\r\nbutted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various colors,\r\nhe had a good deal of time on his hands. And I observed, with great\r\nsurprise, that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were\r\nlost in amazement.\r\n\r\nThere was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.\r\nWopsle\'s eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his\r\nmind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out. I sat\r\nthinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large\r\nwatch-case, and still I could not make it out. I was still thinking\r\nof it when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him\r\nwaiting for me near the door.\r\n\r\n"How do you do?" said I, shaking hands with him as we turned down the\r\nstreet together. "I saw that you saw me."\r\n\r\n"Saw you, Mr. Pip!" he returned. "Yes, of course I saw you. But who else\r\nwas there?"\r\n\r\n"Who else?"\r\n\r\n"It is the strangest thing," said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his lost\r\nlook again; "and yet I could swear to him."\r\n\r\nBecoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his meaning.\r\n\r\n"Whether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there,"\r\nsaid Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, "I can\'t be positive;\r\nyet I think I should."\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round me\r\nwhen I went home; for these mysterious words gave me a chill.\r\n\r\n"Oh! He can\'t be in sight," said Mr. Wopsle. "He went out before I went\r\noff. I saw him go."\r\n\r\nHaving the reason that I had for being suspicious, I even suspected\r\nthis poor actor. I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission.\r\nTherefore I glanced at him as we walked on together, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n"I had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you, Mr. Pip, till I saw\r\nthat you were quite unconscious of him, sitting behind you there like a\r\nghost."\r\n\r\nMy former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to speak\r\nyet, for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on\r\nto induce me to connect these references with Provis. Of course, I was\r\nperfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there.\r\n\r\n"I dare say you wonder at me, Mr. Pip; indeed, I see you do. But it is\r\nso very strange! You\'ll hardly believe what I am going to tell you. I\r\ncould hardly believe it myself, if you told me."\r\n\r\n"Indeed?" said I.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed. Mr. Pip, you remember in old times a certain Christmas Day,\r\nwhen you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargery\'s, and some soldiers\r\ncame to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended?"\r\n\r\n"I remember it very well."\r\n\r\n"And you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and that we\r\njoined in it, and that Gargery took you on his back, and that I took the\r\nlead, and you kept up with me as well as you could?"\r\n\r\n"I remember it all very well." Better than he thought,--except the last\r\nclause.\r\n\r\n"And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that\r\nthere was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been severely\r\nhandled and much mauled about the face by the other?"\r\n\r\n"I see it all before me."\r\n\r\n"And that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre,\r\nand that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes,\r\nwith the torchlight shining on their faces,--I am particular about\r\nthat,--with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was an\r\nouter ring of dark night all about us?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said I. "I remember all that."\r\n\r\n"Then, Mr. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight. I saw\r\nhim over your shoulder."\r\n\r\n"Steady!" I thought. I asked him then, "Which of the two do you suppose\r\nyou saw?"\r\n\r\n"The one who had been mauled," he answered readily, "and I\'ll swear I\r\nsaw him! The more I think of him, the more certain I am of him."\r\n\r\n"This is very curious!" said I, with the best assumption I could put on\r\nof its being nothing more to me. "Very curious indeed!"\r\n\r\nI cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation\r\nthrew me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson\'s\r\nhaving been behind me "like a ghost." For if he had ever been out of my\r\nthoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun, it was\r\nin those very moments when he was closest to me; and to think that I\r\nshould be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if\r\nI had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out, and then had\r\nfound him at my elbow. I could not doubt, either, that he was there,\r\nbecause I was there, and that, however slight an appearance of danger\r\nthere might be about us, danger was always near and active.\r\n\r\nI put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in? He\r\ncould not tell me that; he saw me, and over my shoulder he saw the man.\r\nIt was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identify\r\nhim; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me, and\r\nknown him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time. How was\r\nhe dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought, in\r\nblack. Was his face at all disfigured? No, he believed not. I believed\r\nnot too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no especial\r\nnotice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that a face at all\r\ndisfigured would have attracted my attention.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or I\r\nextract, and when I had treated him to a little appropriate refreshment,\r\nafter the fatigues of the evening, we parted. It was between twelve and\r\none o\'clock when I reached the Temple, and the gates were shut. No one\r\nwas near me when I went in and went home.\r\n\r\nHerbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire. But\r\nthere was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick what I\r\nhad that night found out, and to remind him that we waited for his hint.\r\nAs I thought that I might compromise him if I went too often to the\r\nCastle, I made this communication by letter. I wrote it before I went to\r\nbed, and went out and posted it; and again no one was near me. Herbert\r\nand I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious. And\r\nwe were very cautious indeed,--more cautious than before, if that were\r\npossible,--and I for my part never went near Chinks\'s Basin, except\r\nwhen I rowed by, and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bank as I looked at\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVIII\r\n\r\nThe second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred\r\nabout a week after the first. I had again left my boat at the wharf\r\nbelow Bridge; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon; and,\r\nundecided where to dine, I had strolled up into Cheapside, and was\r\nstrolling along it, surely the most unsettled person in all the busy\r\nconcourse, when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one\r\novertaking me. It was Mr. Jaggers\'s hand, and he passed it through my\r\narm.\r\n\r\n"As we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together. Where\r\nare you bound for?"\r\n\r\n"For the Temple, I think," said I.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know?" said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n"Well," I returned, glad for once to get the better of him in\r\ncross-examination, "I do not know, for I have not made up my mind."\r\n\r\n"You are going to dine?" said Mr. Jaggers. "You don\'t mind admitting\r\nthat, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"No," I returned, "I don\'t mind admitting that."\r\n\r\n"And are not engaged?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind admitting also that I am not engaged."\r\n\r\n"Then," said Mr. Jaggers, "come and dine with me."\r\n\r\nI was going to excuse myself, when he added, "Wemmick\'s coming." So\r\nI changed my excuse into an acceptance,--the few words I had uttered,\r\nserving for the beginning of either,--and we went along Cheapside\r\nand slanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing up\r\nbrilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcely\r\nfinding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the\r\nafternoon\'s bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out,\r\nopening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at\r\nthe Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall.\r\n\r\nAt the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing,\r\nhand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking, that closed the\r\nbusiness of the day. As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers\'s fire, its rising\r\nand falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were\r\nplaying a diabolical game at bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse,\r\nfat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in a\r\ncorner were decorated with dirty winding-sheets, as if in remembrance of\r\na host of hanged clients.\r\n\r\nWe went to Gerrard Street, all three together, in a hackney-coach: And,\r\nas soon as we got there, dinner was served. Although I should not have\r\nthought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much\r\nas a look to Wemmick\'s Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no\r\nobjection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way. But it\r\nwas not to be done. He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he raised\r\nthem from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as if there were\r\ntwin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one.\r\n\r\n"Did you send that note of Miss Havisham\'s to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?" Mr.\r\nJaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.\r\n\r\n"No, sir," returned Wemmick; "it was going by post, when you brought Mr.\r\nPip into the office. Here it is." He handed it to his principal instead\r\nof to me.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a note of two lines, Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, "sent\r\nup to me by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of your\r\naddress. She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of\r\nbusiness you mentioned to her. You\'ll go down?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in those\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n"When do you think of going down?"\r\n\r\n"I have an impending engagement," said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was\r\nputting fish into the post-office, "that renders me rather uncertain of\r\nmy time. At once, I think."\r\n\r\n"If Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once," said Wemmick to Mr.\r\nJaggers, "he needn\'t write an answer, you know."\r\n\r\nReceiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I settled\r\nthat I would go to-morrow, and said so. Wemmick drank a glass of wine,\r\nand looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers, but not at me.\r\n\r\n"So, Pip! Our friend the Spider," said Mr. Jaggers, "has played his\r\ncards. He has won the pool."\r\n\r\nIt was as much as I could do to assent.\r\n\r\n"Hah! He is a promising fellow--in his way--but he may not have it all\r\nhis own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to\r\nbe found out first. If he should turn to, and beat her--"\r\n\r\n"Surely," I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, "you do not\r\nseriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that, Mr. Jaggers?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say so, Pip. I am putting a case. If he should turn to and\r\nbeat her, he may possibly get the strength on his side; if it should be\r\na question of intellect, he certainly will not. It would be chance\r\nwork to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such\r\ncircumstances, because it\'s a toss-up between two results."\r\n\r\n"May I ask what they are?"\r\n\r\n"A fellow like our friend the Spider," answered Mr. Jaggers, "either\r\nbeats or cringes. He may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; but\r\nhe either beats or cringes. Ask Wemmick his opinion."\r\n\r\n"Either beats or cringes," said Wemmick, not at all addressing himself\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n"So here\'s to Mrs. Bentley Drummle," said Mr. Jaggers, taking a decanter\r\nof choicer wine from his dumb-waiter, and filling for each of us and\r\nfor himself, "and may the question of supremacy be settled to the lady\'s\r\nsatisfaction! To the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman,\r\nit never will be. Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how slow you are\r\nto-day!"\r\n\r\nShe was at his elbow when he addressed her, putting a dish upon the\r\ntable. As she withdrew her hands from it, she fell back a step or two,\r\nnervously muttering some excuse. And a certain action of her fingers, as\r\nshe spoke, arrested my attention.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n"Nothing. Only the subject we were speaking of," said I, "was rather\r\npainful to me."\r\n\r\nThe action of her fingers was like the action of knitting. She stood\r\nlooking at her master, not understanding whether she was free to go, or\r\nwhether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did go.\r\nHer look was very intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and such\r\nhands on a memorable occasion very lately!\r\n\r\nHe dismissed her, and she glided out of the room. But she remained\r\nbefore me as plainly as if she were still there. I looked at those\r\nhands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I\r\ncompared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of,\r\nand with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband\r\nand a stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of the\r\nhousekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over\r\nme when I last walked--not alone--in the ruined garden, and through the\r\ndeserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when I\r\nsaw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach\r\nwindow; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like\r\nlightning, when I had passed in a carriage--not alone--through a sudden\r\nglare of light in a dark street. I thought how one link of association\r\nhad helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,\r\nwanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a\r\nchance swift from Estella\'s name to the fingers with their knitting\r\naction, and the attentive eyes. And I felt absolutely certain that this\r\nwoman was Estella\'s mother.\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missed\r\nthe sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. He nodded when I said\r\nthe subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the\r\nwine again, and went on with his dinner.\r\n\r\nOnly twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then her stay in the\r\nroom was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her. But her hands\r\nwere Estella\'s hands, and her eyes were Estella\'s eyes, and if she had\r\nreappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less\r\nsure that my conviction was the truth.\r\n\r\nIt was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew his wine, when it came round,\r\nquite as a matter of business,--just as he might have drawn his salary\r\nwhen that came round,--and with his eyes on his chief, sat in a state of\r\nperpetual readiness for cross-examination. As to the quantity of wine,\r\nhis post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-office\r\nfor its quantity of letters. From my point of view, he was the wrong\r\ntwin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.\r\n\r\nWe took our leave early, and left together. Even when we were groping\r\namong Mr. Jaggers\'s stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the right\r\ntwin was on his way back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down\r\nGerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I was\r\nwalking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin had\r\nevaporated into the evening air.\r\n\r\n"Well!" said Wemmick, "that\'s over! He\'s a wonderful man, without his\r\nliving likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine\r\nwith him,--and I dine more comfortably unscrewed."\r\n\r\nI felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him so.\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t say it to anybody but yourself," he answered. "I know that\r\nwhat is said between you and me goes no further."\r\n\r\nI asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham\'s adopted daughter, Mrs.\r\nBentley Drummle. He said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke\r\nof the Aged and of Miss Skiffins. He looked rather sly when I mentioned\r\nMiss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his nose, with a roll\r\nof the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.\r\n\r\n"Wemmick," said I, "do you remember telling me, before I first went to\r\nMr. Jaggers\'s private house, to notice that housekeeper?"\r\n\r\n"Did I?" he replied. "Ah, I dare say I did. Deuce take me," he added,\r\nsuddenly, "I know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet."\r\n\r\n"A wild beast tamed, you called her."\r\n\r\n"And what do you call her?"\r\n\r\n"The same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s his secret. She has been with him many a long year."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would tell me her story. I feel a particular interest in\r\nbeing acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and me\r\ngoes no further."\r\n\r\n"Well!" Wemmick replied, "I don\'t know her story,--that is, I don\'t know\r\nall of it. But what I do know I\'ll tell you. We are in our private and\r\npersonal capacities, of course."\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\n"A score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for\r\nmurder, and was acquitted. She was a very handsome young woman, and I\r\nbelieve had some gypsy blood in her. Anyhow, it was hot enough when it\r\nwas up, as you may suppose."\r\n\r\n"But she was acquitted."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Jaggers was for her," pursued Wemmick, with a look full of meaning,\r\n"and worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a desperate\r\ncase, and it was comparatively early days with him then, and he worked\r\nit to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said to have made\r\nhim. He worked it himself at the police-office, day after day for many\r\ndays, contending against even a committal; and at the trial where he\r\ncouldn\'t work it himself, sat under counsel, and--every one knew--put\r\nin all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,--a woman a\r\ngood ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger. It was\r\na case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman in\r\nGerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick (as\r\nwe say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy.\r\nThe murdered woman,--more a match for the man, certainly, in point of\r\nyears--was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had been a\r\nviolent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched and\r\ntorn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now, there\r\nwas no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman, and\r\non the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr. Jaggers\r\nprincipally rested his case. You may be sure," said Wemmick, touching me\r\non the sleeve, "that he never dwelt upon the strength of her hands then,\r\nthough he sometimes does now."\r\n\r\nI had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir!" Wemmick went on; "it happened--happened, don\'t you\r\nsee?--that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of\r\nher apprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in\r\nparticular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully\r\ncontrived that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only a bruise\r\nor two about her,--nothing for a tramp,--but the backs of her hands\r\nwere lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails? Now, Mr.\r\nJaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles\r\nwhich were not as high as her face; but which she could not have got\r\nthrough and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles were\r\nactually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the fact that\r\nthe brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken\r\nthrough, and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of\r\nblood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made was this:\r\nit was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that she was\r\nunder strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the murder,\r\nfrantically destroyed her child by this man--some three years old--to\r\nrevenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way: "We say\r\nthese are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and we show\r\nyou the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and you set\r\nup the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept all\r\nconsequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have\r\ndestroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have scratched\r\nher hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder of her\r\nchild; why don\'t you? As to this case, if you will have scratches,\r\nwe say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted for them,\r\nassuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them?" "To\r\nsum up, sir," said Wemmick, "Mr. Jaggers was altogether too many for the\r\njury, and they gave in."\r\n\r\n"Has she been in his service ever since?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but not only that," said Wemmick, "she went into his service\r\nimmediately after her acquittal, tamed as she is now. She has since been\r\ntaught one thing and another in the way of her duties, but she was tamed\r\nfrom the beginning."\r\n\r\n"Do you remember the sex of the child?"\r\n\r\n"Said to have been a girl."\r\n\r\n"You have nothing more to say to me to-night?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing."\r\n\r\nWe exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter for\r\nmy thoughts, though with no relief from the old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIX\r\n\r\nPutting Miss Havisham\'s note in my pocket, that it might serve as\r\nmy credentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House, in case her\r\nwaywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me, I went\r\ndown again by the coach next day. But I alighted at the Halfway House,\r\nand breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; for I sought\r\nto get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and to leave it\r\nin the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet echoing\r\ncourts behind the High Street. The nooks of ruin where the old monks had\r\nonce had their refectories and gardens, and where the strong walls were\r\nnow pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables, were almost\r\nas silent as the old monks in their graves. The cathedral chimes had at\r\nonce a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried on avoiding\r\nobservation, than they had ever had before; so, the swell of the old\r\norgan was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the rooks, as they\r\nhovered about the gray tower and swung in the bare high trees of the\r\npriory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was changed, and that\r\nEstella was gone out of it for ever.\r\n\r\nAn elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants who\r\nlived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened the\r\ngate. The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old,\r\nand I took it up and ascended the staircase alone. Miss Havisham was not\r\nin her own room, but was in the larger room across the landing. Looking\r\nin at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw her sitting on the hearth\r\nin a ragged chair, close before, and lost in the contemplation of, the\r\nashy fire.\r\n\r\nDoing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old\r\nchimney-piece, where she could see me when she raised her eyes. There\r\nwas an air of utter loneliness upon her, that would have moved me to\r\npity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could charge\r\nher with. As I stood compassionating her, and thinking how, in the\r\nprogress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of\r\nthat house, her eyes rested on me. She stared, and said in a low voice,\r\n"Is it real?"\r\n\r\n"It is I, Pip. Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lost\r\nno time."\r\n\r\n"Thank you. Thank you."\r\n\r\nAs I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I\r\nremarked a new expression on her face, as if she were afraid of me.\r\n\r\n"I want," she said, "to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you\r\nwere last here, and to show you that I am not all stone. But perhaps you\r\ncan never believe, now, that there is anything human in my heart?"\r\n\r\nWhen I said some reassuring words, she stretched out her tremulous right\r\nhand, as though she was going to touch me; but she recalled it again\r\nbefore I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.\r\n\r\n"You said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do\r\nsomething useful and good. Something that you would like done, is it\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\n"Something that I would like done very much."\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\nI began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership. I had\r\nnot got far into it, when I judged from her looks that she was thinking\r\nin a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said. It seemed to be\r\nso; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she showed\r\nthat she was conscious of the fact.\r\n\r\n"Do you break off," she asked then, with her former air of being afraid\r\nof me, "because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," I answered, "how can you think so, Miss Havisham! I stopped\r\nbecause I thought you were not following what I said."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I was not," she answered, putting a hand to her head. "Begin\r\nagain, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me."\r\n\r\nShe set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was\r\nhabitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of\r\nforcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told her\r\nhow I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how\r\nin this I was disappointed. That part of the subject (I reminded her)\r\ninvolved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they\r\nwere the weighty secrets of another.\r\n\r\n"So!" said she, assenting with her head, but not looking at me. "And how\r\nmuch money is wanting to complete the purchase?"\r\n\r\nI was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum. "Nine\r\nhundred pounds."\r\n\r\n"If I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret as\r\nyou have kept your own?"\r\n\r\n"Quite as faithfully."\r\n\r\n"And your mind will be more at rest?"\r\n\r\n"Much more at rest."\r\n\r\n"Are you very unhappy now?"\r\n\r\nShe asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an unwonted\r\ntone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my voice failed\r\nme. She put her left arm across the head of her stick, and softly laid\r\nher forehead on it.\r\n\r\n"I am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes of disquiet\r\nthan any you know of. They are the secrets I have mentioned."\r\n\r\nAfter a little while, she raised her head, and looked at the fire again.\r\n\r\n"It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of\r\nunhappiness. Is it true?"\r\n\r\n"Too true."\r\n\r\n"Can I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that as\r\ndone, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing. I thank you for the question. I thank you even more for the\r\ntone of the question. But there is nothing."\r\n\r\nShe presently rose from her seat, and looked about the blighted room\r\nfor the means of writing. There were none there, and she took from her\r\npocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and\r\nwrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from\r\nher neck.\r\n\r\n"You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?"\r\n\r\n"Quite. I dined with him yesterday."\r\n\r\n"This is an authority to him to pay you that money, to lay out at your\r\nirresponsible discretion for your friend. I keep no money here; but if\r\nyou would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send it\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to receiving\r\nit from him."\r\n\r\nShe read me what she had written; and it was direct and clear, and\r\nevidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the\r\nreceipt of the money. I took the tablets from her hand, and it trembled\r\nagain, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the\r\npencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this she did without\r\nlooking at me.\r\n\r\n"My name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under my name, "I\r\nforgive her," though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do\r\nit!"\r\n\r\n"O Miss Havisham," said I, "I can do it now. There have been sore\r\nmistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I want\r\nforgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you."\r\n\r\nShe turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it,\r\nand, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her knees\r\nat my feet; with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which,\r\nwhen her poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often have\r\nbeen raised to heaven from her mother\'s side.\r\n\r\nTo see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet\r\ngave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated her to rise, and got\r\nmy arms about her to help her up; but she only pressed that hand of mine\r\nwhich was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over it and wept. I\r\nhad never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope that the\r\nrelief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking. She was not\r\nkneeling now, but was down upon the ground.\r\n\r\n"O!" she cried, despairingly. "What have I done! What have I done!"\r\n\r\n"If you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let me\r\nanswer. Very little. I should have loved her under any circumstances. Is\r\nshe married?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nIt was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house\r\nhad told me so.\r\n\r\n"What have I done! What have I done!" She wrung her hands, and crushed\r\nher white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again. "What have\r\nI done!"\r\n\r\nI knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her. That she had done a\r\ngrievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form\r\nthat her wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found\r\nvengeance in, I knew full well. But that, in shutting out the light\r\nof day, she had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, she had\r\nsecluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that,\r\nher mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and\r\nmust and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knew\r\nequally well. And could I look upon her without compassion, seeing her\r\npunishment in the ruin she was, in her profound unfitness for this earth\r\non which she was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had become a\r\nmaster mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse, the\r\nvanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have been\r\ncurses in this world?\r\n\r\n"Until you spoke to her the other day, and until I saw in you a\r\nlooking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not know\r\nwhat I had done. What have I done! What have I done!" And so again,\r\ntwenty, fifty times over, What had she done!\r\n\r\n"Miss Havisham," I said, when her cry had died away, "you may dismiss me\r\nfrom your mind and conscience. But Estella is a different case, and if\r\nyou can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a\r\npart of her right nature away from her, it will be better to do that\r\nthan to bemoan the past through a hundred years."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I know it. But, Pip--my dear!" There was an earnest womanly\r\ncompassion for me in her new affection. "My dear! Believe this: when she\r\nfirst came to me, I meant to save her from misery like my own. At first,\r\nI meant no more."\r\n\r\n"Well, well!" said I. "I hope so."\r\n\r\n"But as she grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did\r\nworse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings,\r\nand with this figure of myself always before her, a warning to back and\r\npoint my lessons, I stole her heart away, and put ice in its place."\r\n\r\n"Better," I could not help saying, "to have left her a natural heart,\r\neven to be bruised or broken."\r\n\r\nWith that, Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while, and then\r\nburst out again, What had she done!\r\n\r\n"If you knew all my story," she pleaded, "you would have some compassion\r\nfor me and a better understanding of me."\r\n\r\n"Miss Havisham," I answered, as delicately as I could, "I believe I may\r\nsay that I do know your story, and have known it ever since I first left\r\nthis neighborhood. It has inspired me with great commiseration, and I\r\nhope I understand it and its influences. Does what has passed between us\r\ngive me any excuse for asking you a question relative to Estella? Not as\r\nshe is, but as she was when she first came here?"\r\n\r\nShe was seated on the ground, with her arms on the ragged chair, and\r\nher head leaning on them. She looked full at me when I said this, and\r\nreplied, "Go on."\r\n\r\n"Whose child was Estella?"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know?"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head again.\r\n\r\n"But Mr. Jaggers brought her here, or sent her here?"\r\n\r\n"Brought her here."\r\n\r\n"Will you tell me how that came about?"\r\n\r\nShe answered in a low whisper and with caution: "I had been shut up in\r\nthese rooms a long time (I don\'t know how long; you know what time the\r\nclocks keep here), when I told him that I wanted a little girl to rear\r\nand love, and save from my fate. I had first seen him when I sent\r\nfor him to lay this place waste for me; having read of him in the\r\nnewspapers, before I and the world parted. He told me that he would\r\nlook about him for such an orphan child. One night he brought her here\r\nasleep, and I called her Estella."\r\n\r\n"Might I ask her age then?"\r\n\r\n"Two or three. She herself knows nothing, but that she was left an\r\norphan and I adopted her."\r\n\r\nSo convinced I was of that woman\'s being her mother, that I wanted\r\nno evidence to establish the fact in my own mind. But, to any mind, I\r\nthought, the connection here was clear and straight.\r\n\r\nWhat more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview? I had\r\nsucceeded on behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she knew\r\nof Estella, I had said and done what I could to ease her mind. No matter\r\nwith what other words we parted; we parted.\r\n\r\nTwilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air. I\r\ncalled to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that I would\r\nnot trouble her just yet, but would walk round the place before leaving.\r\nFor I had a presentiment that I should never be there again, and I felt\r\nthat the dying light was suited to my last view of it.\r\n\r\nBy the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on which\r\nthe rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, and\r\nleaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on\r\nend, I made my way to the ruined garden. I went all round it; round by\r\nthe corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by the paths\r\nwhere Estella and I had walked. So cold, so lonely, so dreary all!\r\n\r\nTaking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little\r\ndoor at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going out at the\r\nopposite door,--not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started and\r\nswelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was encumbered\r\nwith a growth of fungus,--when I turned my head to look back. A childish\r\nassociation revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight\r\naction, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to the beam. So\r\nstrong was the impression, that I stood under the beam shuddering from\r\nhead to foot before I knew it was a fancy,--though to be sure I was\r\nthere in an instant.\r\n\r\nThe mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of\r\nthis illusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an\r\nindescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I\r\nhad once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart. Passing on into\r\nthe front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to let me out\r\nat the locked gate of which she had the key, or first to go upstairs\r\nand assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I had left\r\nher. I took the latter course and went up.\r\n\r\nI looked into the room where I had left her, and I saw her seated in the\r\nragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her back towards\r\nme. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly away,\r\nI saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same moment I saw her\r\nrunning at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about her,\r\nand soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high.\r\n\r\nI had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat.\r\nThat I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and got them over\r\nher; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose,\r\nand with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst, and\r\nall the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on the ground\r\nstruggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered her,\r\nthe more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself,--that this\r\noccurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or\r\nthought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the\r\nfloor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were\r\nfloating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her faded\r\nbridal dress.\r\n\r\nThen, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running\r\naway over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries\r\nat the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, like\r\na prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was, or\r\nwhy we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that the flames\r\nwere out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments\r\nno longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.\r\n\r\nShe was insensible, and I was afraid to have her moved, or even\r\ntouched. Assistance was sent for, and I held her until it came, as if\r\nI unreasonably fancied (I think I did) that, if I let her go, the fire\r\nwould break out again and consume her. When I got up, on the surgeon\'s\r\ncoming to her with other aid, I was astonished to see that both my hands\r\nwere burnt; for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling.\r\n\r\nOn examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts,\r\nbut that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay\r\nmainly in the nervous shock. By the surgeon\'s directions, her bed was\r\ncarried into that room and laid upon the great table, which happened to\r\nbe well suited to the dressing of her injuries. When I saw her again, an\r\nhour afterwards, she lay, indeed, where I had seen her strike her stick,\r\nand had heard her say that she would lie one day.\r\n\r\nThough every vestige of her dress was burnt, as they told me, she\r\nstill had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they had\r\ncovered her to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as she lay with\r\na white sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that\r\nhad been and was changed was still upon her.\r\n\r\nI found, on questioning the servants, that Estella was in Paris, and I\r\ngot a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the\r\nnext post. Miss Havisham\'s family I took upon myself; intending to\r\ncommunicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only, and leave him to do as he\r\nliked about informing the rest. This I did next day, through Herbert, as\r\nsoon as I returned to town.\r\n\r\nThere was a stage, that evening, when she spoke collectedly of what had\r\nhappened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards midnight she\r\nbegan to wander in her speech; and after that it gradually set in that\r\nshe said innumerable times in a low solemn voice, "What have I done!"\r\nAnd then, "When she first came, I meant to save her from misery like\r\nmine." And then, "Take the pencil and write under my name, \'I forgive\r\nher!\'" She never changed the order of these three sentences, but she\r\nsometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting in\r\nanother word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.\r\n\r\nAs I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, that pressing\r\nreason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could not drive\r\nout of my mind, I decided, in the course of the night that I would\r\nreturn by the early morning coach, walking on a mile or so, and being\r\ntaken up clear of the town. At about six o\'clock of the morning,\r\ntherefore, I leaned over her and touched her lips with mine, just as\r\nthey said, not stopping for being touched, "Take the pencil and write\r\nunder my name, \'I forgive her.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter L\r\n\r\nMy hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night, and again in\r\nthe morning. My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less\r\nseverely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flames\r\nhad set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse. My right\r\nhand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers. It was\r\nbandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left hand and\r\narm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat like a\r\ncloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck. My hair had\r\nbeen caught by the fire, but not my head or face.\r\n\r\nWhen Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his father, he came\r\nback to me at our chambers, and devoted the day to attending on me. He\r\nwas the kindest of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages,\r\nand steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready, and put them\r\non again, with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful for.\r\n\r\nAt first, as I lay quiet on the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, I\r\nmight say impossible, to get rid of the impression of the glare of the\r\nflames, their hurry and noise, and the fierce burning smell. If I\r\ndozed for a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havisham\'s cries, and by her\r\nrunning at me with all that height of fire above her head. This pain\r\nof the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I\r\nsuffered; and Herbert, seeing that, did his utmost to hold my attention\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nNeither of us spoke of the boat, but we both thought of it. That\r\nwas made apparent by our avoidance of the subject, and by our\r\nagreeing--without agreement--to make my recovery of the use of my hands\r\na question of so many hours, not of so many weeks.\r\n\r\nMy first question when I saw Herbert had been of course, whether all\r\nwas well down the river? As he replied in the affirmative, with perfect\r\nconfidence and cheerfulness, we did not resume the subject until the day\r\nwas wearing away. But then, as Herbert changed the bandages, more by\r\nthe light of the fire than by the outer light, he went back to it\r\nspontaneously.\r\n\r\n"I sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours."\r\n\r\n"Where was Clara?"\r\n\r\n"Dear little thing!" said Herbert. "She was up and down with\r\nGruffandgrim all the evening. He was perpetually pegging at the floor\r\nthe moment she left his sight. I doubt if he can hold out long, though.\r\nWhat with rum and pepper,--and pepper and rum,--I should think his\r\npegging must be nearly over."\r\n\r\n"And then you will be married, Herbert?"\r\n\r\n"How can I take care of the dear child otherwise?--Lay your arm out upon\r\nthe back of the sofa, my dear boy, and I\'ll sit down here, and get the\r\nbandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes. I was\r\nspeaking of Provis. Do you know, Handel, he improves?"\r\n\r\n"I said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him."\r\n\r\n"So you did. And so he is. He was very communicative last night, and\r\ntold me more of his life. You remember his breaking off here about some\r\nwoman that he had had great trouble with.--Did I hurt you?"\r\n\r\nI had started, but not under his touch. His words had given me a start.\r\n\r\n"I had forgotten that, Herbert, but I remember it now you speak of it."\r\n\r\n"Well! He went into that part of his life, and a dark wild part it is.\r\nShall I tell you? Or would it worry you just now?"\r\n\r\n"Tell me by all means. Every word."\r\n\r\nHerbert bent forward to look at me more nearly, as if my reply had been\r\nrather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for. "Your\r\nhead is cool?" he said, touching it.\r\n\r\n"Quite," said I. "Tell me what Provis said, my dear Herbert."\r\n\r\n"It seems," said Herbert, "--there\'s a bandage off most charmingly, and\r\nnow comes the cool one,--makes you shrink at first, my poor dear fellow,\r\ndon\'t it? but it will be comfortable presently,--it seems that the\r\nwoman was a young woman, and a jealous woman, and a revengeful woman;\r\nrevengeful, Handel, to the last degree."\r\n\r\n"To what last degree?"\r\n\r\n"Murder.--Does it strike too cold on that sensitive place?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t feel it. How did she murder? Whom did she murder?"\r\n\r\n"Why, the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name,"\r\nsaid Herbert, "but, she was tried for it, and Mr. Jaggers defended\r\nher, and the reputation of that defence first made his name known\r\nto Provis. It was another and a stronger woman who was the victim,\r\nand there had been a struggle--in a barn. Who began it, or how fair\r\nit was, or how unfair, may be doubtful; but how it ended is\r\ncertainly not doubtful, for the victim was found throttled."\r\n\r\n"Was the woman brought in guilty?"\r\n\r\n"No; she was acquitted.--My poor Handel, I hurt you!"\r\n\r\n"It is impossible to be gentler, Herbert. Yes? What else?"\r\n\r\n"This acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child; a little\r\nchild of whom Provis was exceedingly fond. On the evening of the very\r\nnight when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you, the\r\nyoung woman presented herself before Provis for one moment, and swore\r\nthat she would destroy the child (which was in her possession), and he\r\nshould never see it again; then she vanished.--There\'s the worst arm\r\ncomfortably in the sling once more, and now there remains but the right\r\nhand, which is a far easier job. I can do it better by this light\r\nthan by a stronger, for my hand is steadiest when I don\'t see the poor\r\nblistered patches too distinctly.--You don\'t think your breathing is\r\naffected, my dear boy? You seem to breathe quickly."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I do, Herbert. Did the woman keep her oath?"\r\n\r\n"There comes the darkest part of Provis\'s life. She did."\r\n\r\n"That is, he says she did."\r\n\r\n"Why, of course, my dear boy," returned Herbert, in a tone of surprise,\r\nand again bending forward to get a nearer look at me. "He says it all. I\r\nhave no other information."\r\n\r\n"No, to be sure."\r\n\r\n"Now, whether," pursued Herbert, "he had used the child\'s mother ill, or\r\nwhether he had used the child\'s mother well, Provis doesn\'t say; but she\r\nhad shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described\r\nto us at this fireside, and he seems to have felt pity for her, and\r\nforbearance towards her. Therefore, fearing he should be called upon to\r\ndepose about this destroyed child, and so be the cause of her death, he\r\nhid himself (much as he grieved for the child), kept himself dark, as he\r\nsays, out of the way and out of the trial, and was only vaguely talked\r\nof as a certain man called Abel, out of whom the jealousy arose. After\r\nthe acquittal she disappeared, and thus he lost the child and the\r\nchild\'s mother."\r\n\r\n"I want to ask--"\r\n\r\n"A moment, my dear boy, and I have done. That evil genius, Compeyson,\r\nthe worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels, knowing of his keeping\r\nout of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so, of course\r\nafterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him\r\npoorer and working him harder. It was clear last night that this barbed\r\nthe point of Provis\'s animosity."\r\n\r\n"I want to know," said I, "and particularly, Herbert, whether he told\r\nyou when this happened?"\r\n\r\n"Particularly? Let me remember, then, what he said as to that. His\r\nexpression was, \'a round score o\' year ago, and a\'most directly after I\r\ntook up wi\' Compeyson.\' How old were you when you came upon him in the\r\nlittle churchyard?"\r\n\r\n"I think in my seventh year."\r\n\r\n"Ay. It had happened some three or four years then, he said, and you\r\nbrought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost, who would have\r\nbeen about your age."\r\n\r\n"Herbert," said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, "can you see\r\nme best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?"\r\n\r\n"By the firelight," answered Herbert, coming close again.\r\n\r\n"Look at me."\r\n\r\n"I do look at you, my dear boy."\r\n\r\n"Touch me."\r\n\r\n"I do touch you, my dear boy."\r\n\r\n"You are not afraid that I am in any fever, or that my head is much\r\ndisordered by the accident of last night?"\r\n\r\n"N-no, my dear boy," said Herbert, after taking time to examine me. "You\r\nare rather excited, but you are quite yourself."\r\n\r\n"I know I am quite myself. And the man we have in hiding down the river,\r\nis Estella\'s Father."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LI\r\n\r\nWhat purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving\r\nEstella\'s parentage, I cannot say. It will presently be seen that the\r\nquestion was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before\r\nme by a wiser head than my own.\r\n\r\nBut when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I was seized\r\nwith a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter down,--that I\r\nought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr. Jaggers, and come\r\nat the bare truth. I really do not know whether I felt that I did this\r\nfor Estella\'s sake, or whether I was glad to transfer to the man in\r\nwhose preservation I was so much concerned some rays of the romantic\r\ninterest that had so long surrounded me. Perhaps the latter possibility\r\nmay be the nearer to the truth.\r\n\r\nAny way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street\r\nthat night. Herbert\'s representations that, if I did, I should probably\r\nbe laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive\'s safety would depend\r\nupon me, alone restrained my impatience. On the understanding, again\r\nand again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mr. Jaggers\r\nto-morrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my hurts\r\nlooked after, and to stay at home. Early next morning we went out\r\ntogether, and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield, I left\r\nHerbert to go his way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain.\r\n\r\nThere were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick went over\r\nthe office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things\r\nstraight. On these occasions, Wemmick took his books and papers into Mr.\r\nJaggers\'s room, and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the outer\r\noffice. Finding such clerk on Wemmick\'s post that morning, I knew\r\nwhat was going on; but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick\r\ntogether, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to\r\ncompromise him.\r\n\r\nMy appearance, with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders,\r\nfavored my object. Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a brief account of\r\nthe accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to give him all\r\nthe details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk\r\nto be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the rules of\r\nevidence, than it had been before. While I described the disaster, Mr.\r\nJaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire. Wemmick leaned\r\nback in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in the pockets of his\r\ntrousers, and his pen put horizontally into the post. The two brutal\r\ncasts, always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings,\r\nseemed to be congestively considering whether they didn\'t smell fire at\r\nthe present moment.\r\n\r\nMy narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced\r\nMiss Havisham\'s authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for\r\nHerbert. Mr. Jaggers\'s eyes retired a little deeper into his head when\r\nI handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick,\r\nwith instructions to draw the check for his signature. While that was\r\nin course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr.\r\nJaggers, poising and swaying himself on his well-polished boots, looked\r\non at me. "I am sorry, Pip," said he, as I put the check in my pocket,\r\nwhen he had signed it, "that we do nothing for you."\r\n\r\n"Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me," I returned, "whether she\r\ncould do nothing for me, and I told her No."\r\n\r\n"Everybody should know his own business," said Mr. Jaggers. And I saw\r\nWemmick\'s lips form the words "portable property."\r\n\r\n"I should not have told her No, if I had been you," said Mr Jaggers;\r\n"but every man ought to know his own business best."\r\n\r\n"Every man\'s business," said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me,\r\n"is portable property."\r\n\r\nAs I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at\r\nheart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:--\r\n\r\n"I did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir. I asked her to give\r\nme some information relative to her adopted daughter, and she gave me\r\nall she possessed."\r\n\r\n"Did she?" said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots and\r\nthen straightening himself. "Hah! I don\'t think I should have done so,\r\nif I had been Miss Havisham. But she ought to know her own business\r\nbest."\r\n\r\n"I know more of the history of Miss Havisham\'s adopted child than Miss\r\nHavisham herself does, sir. I know her mother."\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated "Mother?"\r\n\r\n"I have seen her mother within these three days."\r\n\r\n"Yes?" said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n"And so have you, sir. And you have seen her still more recently."\r\n\r\n"Yes?" said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I know more of Estella\'s history than even you do," said I. "I\r\nknow her father too."\r\n\r\nA certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his manner--he was too\r\nself-possessed to change his manner, but he could not help its being\r\nbrought to an indefinably attentive stop--assured me that he did not\r\nknow who her father was. This I had strongly suspected from Provis\'s\r\naccount (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark;\r\nwhich I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers\'s\r\nclient until some four years later, and when he could have no reason for\r\nclaiming his identity. But, I could not be sure of this unconsciousness\r\non Mr. Jaggers\'s part before, though I was quite sure of it now.\r\n\r\n"So! You know the young lady\'s father, Pip?" said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I replied, "and his name is Provis--from New South Wales."\r\n\r\nEven Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slightest\r\nstart that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the\r\nsooner checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of the\r\naction of taking out his pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the\r\nannouncement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him just\r\nthen, lest Mr. Jaggers\'s sharpness should detect that there had been\r\nsome communication unknown to him between us.\r\n\r\n"And on what evidence, Pip," asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he\r\npaused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, "does Provis make\r\nthis claim?"\r\n\r\n"He does not make it," said I, "and has never made it, and has no\r\nknowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence."\r\n\r\nFor once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so\r\nunexpected, that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket\r\nwithout completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and looked\r\nwith stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.\r\n\r\nThen I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation\r\nthat I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact\r\nknew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I look\r\ntowards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been for\r\nsome time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers\'s look. When I did at last turn\r\nmy eyes in Wemmick\'s direction, I found that he had unposted his pen,\r\nand was intent upon the table before him.\r\n\r\n"Hah!" said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers on the\r\ntable. "What item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?"\r\n\r\nBut I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a\r\npassionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him to be more frank and\r\nmanly with me. I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had\r\nlapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had\r\nmade: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I\r\nrepresented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from\r\nhim, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said that\r\nI did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted\r\nassurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it,\r\nand why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he\r\ncared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,\r\nand that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,\r\nwhatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything\r\nelse in the world. And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and\r\nsilent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to\r\nWemmick, and said, "Wemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle\r\nheart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the\r\ninnocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business\r\nlife. And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and to\r\nrepresent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to be more\r\nopen with me!"\r\n\r\nI have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr.\r\nJaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving\r\ncrossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his\r\nemployment; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something like\r\na smile, and Wemmick become bolder.\r\n\r\n"What\'s all this?" said Mr. Jaggers. "You with an old father, and you\r\nwith pleasant and playful ways?"\r\n\r\n"Well!" returned Wemmick. "If I don\'t bring \'em here, what does it\r\nmatter?"\r\n\r\n"Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling\r\nopenly, "this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it," returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. "I think\r\nyou\'re another."\r\n\r\nAgain they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still\r\ndistrustful that the other was taking him in.\r\n\r\n"You with a pleasant home?" said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n"Since it don\'t interfere with business," returned Wemmick, "let it be\r\nso. Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn\'t wonder if you might be planning\r\nand contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days,\r\nwhen you\'re tired of all this work."\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, and\r\nactually drew a sigh. "Pip," said he, "we won\'t talk about \'poor\r\ndreams;\' you know more about such things than I, having much fresher\r\nexperience of that kind. But now about this other matter. I\'ll put a\r\ncase to you. Mind! I admit nothing."\r\n\r\nHe waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly\r\nsaid that he admitted nothing.\r\n\r\n"Now, Pip," said Mr. Jaggers, "put this case. Put the case that a\r\nwoman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her child\r\nconcealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser,\r\non his representing to her that he must know, with an eye to the\r\nlatitude of his defence, how the fact stood about that child. Put the\r\ncase that, at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an\r\neccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up."\r\n\r\n"I follow you, sir."\r\n\r\n"Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he\r\nsaw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain\r\ndestruction. Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at\r\na criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case that\r\nhe habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported,\r\nneglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing\r\nup to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw\r\nin his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much\r\nspawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to his net,--to be\r\nprosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow."\r\n\r\n"I follow you, sir."\r\n\r\n"Put the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the\r\nheap who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make\r\nno stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this\r\npower: "I know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so, you\r\ndid such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked you through\r\nit all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless it should\r\nbe necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be produced.\r\nGive the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bring you off. If\r\nyou are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost, your child is\r\nstill saved." Put the case that this was done, and that the woman was\r\ncleared."\r\n\r\n"I understand you perfectly."\r\n\r\n"But that I make no admissions?"\r\n\r\n"That you make no admissions." And Wemmick repeated, "No admissions."\r\n\r\n"Put the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little\r\nshaken the woman\'s intellects, and that when she was set at liberty,\r\nshe was scared out of the ways of the world, and went to him to be\r\nsheltered. Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the\r\nold, wild, violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking\r\nout, by asserting his power over her in the old way. Do you comprehend\r\nthe imaginary case?"\r\n\r\n"Quite."\r\n\r\n"Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. That\r\nthe mother was still living. That the father was still living. That the\r\nmother and father, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many\r\nmiles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the secret was\r\nstill a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last case\r\nto yourself very carefully."\r\n\r\n"I do."\r\n\r\n"I ask Wemmick to put it to himself very carefully."\r\n\r\nAnd Wemmick said, "I do."\r\n\r\n"For whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the father\'s? I think\r\nhe would not be much the better for the mother. For the mother\'s? I\r\nthink if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was.\r\nFor the daughter\'s? I think it would hardly serve her to establish her\r\nparentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back to\r\ndisgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for\r\nlife. But add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made her the\r\nsubject of those \'poor dreams\' which have, at one time or another, been\r\nin the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you that you\r\nhad better--and would much sooner when you had thought well of it--chop\r\noff that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand, and\r\nthen pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut that off too."\r\n\r\nI looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He gravely touched his\r\nlips with his forefinger. I did the same. Mr. Jaggers did the same.\r\n"Now, Wemmick," said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, "what\r\nitem was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in?"\r\n\r\nStanding by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the\r\nodd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times: with\r\nthis difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to say\r\nconscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to\r\nthe other. For this reason, I suppose, they were now inflexible with one\r\nanother; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and Wemmick obstinately\r\njustifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for\r\na moment. I had never seen them on such ill terms; for generally they\r\ngot on very well indeed together.\r\n\r\nBut they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of Mike,\r\nthe client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his\r\nsleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance within\r\nthose walls. This individual, who, either in his own person or in that\r\nof some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble (which in\r\nthat place meant Newgate), called to announce that his eldest daughter\r\nwas taken up on suspicion of shoplifting. As he imparted this melancholy\r\ncircumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially before the\r\nfire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike\'s eye happened to\r\ntwinkle with a tear.\r\n\r\n"What are you about?" demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.\r\n"What do you come snivelling here for?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t go to do it, Mr. Wemmick."\r\n\r\n"You did," said Wemmick. "How dare you? You\'re not in a fit state to\r\ncome here, if you can\'t come here without spluttering like a bad pen.\r\nWhat do you mean by it?"\r\n\r\n"A man can\'t help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick," pleaded Mike.\r\n\r\n"His what?" demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. "Say that again!"\r\n\r\n"Now look here my man," said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, and pointing\r\nto the door. "Get out of this office. I\'ll have no feelings here. Get\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"It serves you right," said Wemmick, "Get out."\r\n\r\nSo, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and\r\nWemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and\r\nwent to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had\r\njust had lunch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LII\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Little Britain I went, with my check in my pocket, to Miss\r\nSkiffins\'s brother, the accountant; and Miss Skiffins\'s brother, the\r\naccountant, going straight to Clarriker\'s and bringing Clarriker to me,\r\nI had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement. It was the\r\nonly good thing I had done, and the only completed thing I had done,\r\nsince I was first apprised of my great expectations.\r\n\r\nClarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the House\r\nwere steadily progressing, that he would now be able to establish a\r\nsmall branch-house in the East which was much wanted for the extension\r\nof the business, and that Herbert in his new partnership capacity would\r\ngo out and take charge of it, I found that I must have prepared for\r\na separation from my friend, even though my own affairs had been more\r\nsettled. And now, indeed, I felt as if my last anchor were loosening its\r\nhold, and I should soon be driving with the winds and waves.\r\n\r\nBut there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would come home\r\nof a night and tell me of these changes, little imagining that he told\r\nme no news, and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting Clara\r\nBarley to the land of the Arabian Nights, and of me going out to join\r\nthem (with a caravan of camels, I believe), and of our all going up the\r\nNile and seeing wonders. Without being sanguine as to my own part in\r\nthose bright plans, I felt that Herbert\'s way was clearing fast, and\r\nthat old Bill Barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum, and his\r\ndaughter would soon be happily provided for.\r\n\r\nWe had now got into the month of March. My left arm, though it presented\r\nno bad symptoms, took, in the natural course, so long to heal that I\r\nwas still unable to get a coat on. My right arm was tolerably restored;\r\ndisfigured, but fairly serviceable.\r\n\r\nOn a Monday morning, when Herbert and I were at breakfast, I received\r\nthe following letter from Wemmick by the post.\r\n\r\n"Walworth. Burn this as soon as read. Early in the week, or say\r\nWednesday, you might do what you know of, if you felt disposed to try\r\nit. Now burn."\r\n\r\nWhen I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the fire--but not\r\nbefore we had both got it by heart--we considered what to do. For, of\r\ncourse my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view.\r\n\r\n"I have thought it over again and again," said Herbert, "and I think I\r\nknow a better course than taking a Thames waterman. Take Startop. A good\r\nfellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic and honorable."\r\n\r\nI had thought of him more than once.\r\n\r\n"But how much would you tell him, Herbert?"\r\n\r\n"It is necessary to tell him very little. Let him suppose it a mere\r\nfreak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let him know that\r\nthere is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away. You go\r\nwith him?"\r\n\r\n"No doubt."\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\nIt had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given the\r\npoint, almost indifferent what port we made for,--Hamburg, Rotterdam,\r\nAntwerp,--the place signified little, so that he was out of England. Any\r\nforeign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do.\r\nI had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the\r\nboat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for\r\nsearch or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As foreign steamers would\r\nleave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get\r\ndown the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot\r\nuntil we could pull off to one. The time when one would be due where we\r\nlay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we\r\nmade inquiries beforehand.\r\n\r\nHerbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after\r\nbreakfast to pursue our investigations. We found that a steamer for\r\nHamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our\r\nthoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreign\r\nsteamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied\r\nourselves that we knew the build and color of each. We then separated\r\nfor a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary;\r\nHerbert, to see Startop at his lodgings. We both did what we had to do\r\nwithout any hindrance, and when we met again at one o\'clock reported\r\nit done. I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen\r\nStartop, and he was more than ready to join.\r\n\r\nThose two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer; our\r\ncharge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our object, we\r\nshould make way enough. We arranged that Herbert should not come home to\r\ndinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that he should\r\nnot go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that he should prepare\r\nProvis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on Wednesday, when\r\nhe saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the arrangements with\r\nhim should be concluded that Monday night; and that he should be\r\ncommunicated with no more in any way, until we took him on board.\r\n\r\nThese precautions well understood by both of us, I went home.\r\n\r\nOn opening the outer door of our chambers with my key, I found a letter\r\nin the box, directed to me; a very dirty letter, though not ill-written.\r\nIt had been delivered by hand (of course, since I left home), and its\r\ncontents were these:--\r\n\r\n"If you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to-night or to-morrow\r\nnight at nine, and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln,\r\nyou had better come. If you want information regarding your uncle\r\nProvis, you had much better come and tell no one, and lose no time. You\r\nmust come alone. Bring this with you."\r\n\r\nI had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange\r\nletter. What to do now, I could not tell. And the worst was, that I must\r\ndecide quickly, or I should miss the afternoon coach, which would take\r\nme down in time for to-night. To-morrow night I could not think of\r\ngoing, for it would be too close upon the time of the flight. And again,\r\nfor anything I knew, the proffered information might have some important\r\nbearing on the flight itself.\r\n\r\nIf I had had ample time for consideration, I believe I should still have\r\ngone. Having hardly any time for consideration,--my watch showing me\r\nthat the coach started within half an hour,--I resolved to go. I should\r\ncertainly not have gone, but for the reference to my Uncle Provis. That,\r\ncoming on Wemmick\'s letter and the morning\'s busy preparation, turned\r\nthe scale.\r\n\r\nIt is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost\r\nany letter, in a violent hurry, that I had to read this mysterious\r\nepistle again twice, before its injunction to me to be secret got\r\nmechanically into my mind. Yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of\r\nway, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, telling him that as I should\r\nbe so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I had decided to hurry\r\ndown and back, to ascertain for myself how Miss Havisham was faring.\r\nI had then barely time to get my great-coat, lock up the chambers,\r\nand make for the coach-office by the short by-ways. If I had taken a\r\nhackney-chariot and gone by the streets, I should have missed my aim;\r\ngoing as I did, I caught the coach just as it came out of the yard. I\r\nwas the only inside passenger, jolting away knee-deep in straw, when I\r\ncame to myself.\r\n\r\nFor I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter; it had\r\nso bewildered me, ensuing on the hurry of the morning. The morning hurry\r\nand flutter had been great; for, long and anxiously as I had waited for\r\nWemmick, his hint had come like a surprise at last. And now I began\r\nto wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubt whether I had\r\nsufficient reason for being there, and to consider whether I should\r\nget out presently and go back, and to argue against ever heeding an\r\nanonymous communication, and, in short, to pass through all those phases\r\nof contradiction and indecision to which I suppose very few hurried\r\npeople are strangers. Still, the reference to Provis by name mastered\r\neverything. I reasoned as I had reasoned already without knowing it,--if\r\nthat be reasoning,--in case any harm should befall him through my not\r\ngoing, how could I ever forgive myself!\r\n\r\nIt was dark before we got down, and the journey seemed long and dreary\r\nto me, who could see little of it inside, and who could not go outside\r\nin my disabled state. Avoiding the Blue Boar, I put up at an inn of\r\nminor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner. While it was\r\npreparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham; she was\r\nstill very ill, though considered something better.\r\n\r\nMy inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and I\r\ndined in a little octagonal common-room, like a font. As I was not able\r\nto cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for\r\nme. This bringing us into conversation, he was so good as to entertain\r\nme with my own story,--of course with the popular feature that\r\nPumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes.\r\n\r\n"Do you know the young man?" said I.\r\n\r\n"Know him!" repeated the landlord. "Ever since he was--no height at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Does he ever come back to this neighborhood?"\r\n\r\n"Ay, he comes back," said the landlord, "to his great friends, now and\r\nagain, and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him."\r\n\r\n"What man is that?"\r\n\r\n"Him that I speak of," said the landlord. "Mr. Pumblechook."\r\n\r\n"Is he ungrateful to no one else?"\r\n\r\n"No doubt he would be, if he could," returned the landlord, "but he\r\ncan\'t. And why? Because Pumblechook done everything for him."\r\n\r\n"Does Pumblechook say so?"\r\n\r\n"Say so!" replied the landlord. "He han\'t no call to say so."\r\n\r\n"But does he say so?"\r\n\r\n"It would turn a man\'s blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of\r\nit, sir," said the landlord.\r\n\r\nI thought, "Yet Joe, dear Joe, you never tell of it. Long-suffering and\r\nloving Joe, you never complain. Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!"\r\n\r\n"Your appetite\'s been touched like by your accident," said the landlord,\r\nglancing at the bandaged arm under my coat. "Try a tenderer bit."\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," I replied, turning from the table to brood over the\r\nfire. "I can eat no more. Please take it away."\r\n\r\nI had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Joe, as\r\nthrough the brazen impostor Pumblechook. The falser he, the truer Joe;\r\nthe meaner he, the nobler Joe.\r\n\r\nMy heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over the fire\r\nfor an hour or more. The striking of the clock aroused me, but not from\r\nmy dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my coat fastened round\r\nmy neck, and went out. I had previously sought in my pockets for the\r\nletter, that I might refer to it again; but I could not find it, and\r\nwas uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of\r\nthe coach. I knew very well, however, that the appointed place was the\r\nlittle sluice-house by the limekiln on the marshes, and the hour nine.\r\nTowards the marshes I now went straight, having no time to spare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIII\r\n\r\nIt was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed\r\nlands, and passed out upon the marshes. Beyond their dark line there was\r\na ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon.\r\nIn a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field, in among the\r\npiled mountains of cloud.\r\n\r\nThere was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal. A\r\nstranger would have found them insupportable, and even to me they were\r\nso oppressive that I hesitated, half inclined to go back. But I knew\r\nthem well, and could have found my way on a far darker night, and had\r\nno excuse for returning, being there. So, having come there against my\r\ninclination, I went on against it.\r\n\r\nThe direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay, nor\r\nthat in which we had pursued the convicts. My back was turned towards\r\nthe distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the old lights\r\naway on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder. I knew the\r\nlimekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were miles apart;\r\nso that, if a light had been burning at each point that night, there\r\nwould have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright\r\nspecks.\r\n\r\nAt first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to stand\r\nstill while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose\r\nand blundered down among the grass and reeds. But after a little while I\r\nseemed to have the whole flats to myself.\r\n\r\nIt was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln. The lime was\r\nburning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up and\r\nleft, and no workmen were visible. Hard by was a small stone-quarry. It\r\nlay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by the\r\ntools and barrows that were lying about.\r\n\r\nComing up again to the marsh level out of this excavation,--for the rude\r\npath lay through it,--I saw a light in the old sluice-house. I quickened\r\nmy pace, and knocked at the door with my hand. Waiting for some reply,\r\nI looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken, and\r\nhow the house--of wood with a tiled roof--would not be proof against the\r\nweather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and ooze\r\nwere coated with lime, and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a\r\nghostly way towards me. Still there was no answer, and I knocked again.\r\nNo answer still, and I tried the latch.\r\n\r\nIt rose under my hand, and the door yielded. Looking in, I saw a lighted\r\ncandle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a truckle bedstead. As\r\nthere was a loft above, I called, "Is there any one here?" but no voice\r\nanswered. Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that it was past nine,\r\ncalled again, "Is there any one here?" There being still no answer, I\r\nwent out at the door, irresolute what to do.\r\n\r\nIt was beginning to rain fast. Seeing nothing save what I had seen\r\nalready, I turned back into the house, and stood just within the shelter\r\nof the doorway, looking out into the night. While I was considering that\r\nsome one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back, or\r\nthe candle would not be burning, it came into my head to look if the\r\nwick were long. I turned round to do so, and had taken up the candle in\r\nmy hand, when it was extinguished by some violent shock; and the next\r\nthing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in a strong running\r\nnoose, thrown over my head from behind.\r\n\r\n"Now," said a suppressed voice with an oath, "I\'ve got you!"\r\n\r\n"What is this?" I cried, struggling. "Who is it? Help, help, help!"\r\n\r\nNot only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on\r\nmy bad arm caused me exquisite pain. Sometimes, a strong man\'s hand,\r\nsometimes a strong man\'s breast, was set against my mouth to deaden\r\nmy cries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggled\r\nineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall. "And\r\nnow," said the suppressed voice with another oath, "call out again, and\r\nI\'ll make short work of you!"\r\n\r\nFaint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the\r\nsurprise, and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in\r\nexecution, I desisted, and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little.\r\nBut, it was bound too tight for that. I felt as if, having been burnt\r\nbefore, it were now being boiled.\r\n\r\nThe sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of black\r\ndarkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter.\r\nAfter groping about for a little, he found the flint and steel he\r\nwanted, and began to strike a light. I strained my sight upon the sparks\r\nthat fell among the tinder, and upon which he breathed and breathed,\r\nmatch in hand, but I could only see his lips, and the blue point of\r\nthe match; even those but fitfully. The tinder was damp,--no wonder\r\nthere,--and one after another the sparks died out.\r\n\r\nThe man was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel. As\r\nthe sparks fell thick and bright about him, I could see his hands, and\r\ntouches of his face, and could make out that he was seated and bending\r\nover the table; but nothing more. Presently I saw his blue lips again,\r\nbreathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and\r\nshowed me Orlick.\r\n\r\nWhom I had looked for, I don\'t know. I had not looked for him. Seeing\r\nhim, I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyes\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nHe lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation,\r\nand dropped the match, and trod it out. Then he put the candle away from\r\nhim on the table, so that he could see me, and sat with his arms folded\r\non the table and looked at me. I made out that I was fastened to a stout\r\nperpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall,--a fixture there,--the\r\nmeans of ascent to the loft above.\r\n\r\n"Now," said he, when we had surveyed one another for some time, "I\'ve\r\ngot you."\r\n\r\n"Unbind me. Let me go!"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he returned, "I\'ll let you go. I\'ll let you go to the moon, I\'ll\r\nlet you go to the stars. All in good time."\r\n\r\n"Why have you lured me here?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know?" said he, with a deadly look.\r\n\r\n"Why have you set upon me in the dark?"\r\n\r\n"Because I mean to do it all myself. One keeps a secret better than two.\r\nO you enemy, you enemy!"\r\n\r\nHis enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he sat with his arms\r\nfolded on the table, shaking his head at me and hugging himself, had a\r\nmalignity in it that made me tremble. As I watched him in silence,\r\nhe put his hand into the corner at his side, and took up a gun with a\r\nbrass-bound stock.\r\n\r\n"Do you know this?" said he, making as if he would take aim at me. "Do\r\nyou know where you saw it afore? Speak, wolf!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I answered.\r\n\r\n"You cost me that place. You did. Speak!"\r\n\r\n"What else could I do?"\r\n\r\n"You did that, and that would be enough, without more. How dared you to\r\ncome betwixt me and a young woman I liked?"\r\n\r\n"When did I?"\r\n\r\n"When didn\'t you? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"You gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself. I could have done\r\nyou no harm, if you had done yourself none."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a liar. And you\'ll take any pains, and spend any money, to drive\r\nme out of this country, will you?" said he, repeating my words to Biddy\r\nin the last interview I had with her. "Now, I\'ll tell you a piece of\r\ninformation. It was never so well worth your while to get me out of this\r\ncountry as it is to-night. Ah! If it was all your money twenty times\r\ntold, to the last brass farden!" As he shook his heavy hand at me, with\r\nhis mouth snarling like a tiger\'s, I felt that it was true.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do to me?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m a going," said he, bringing his fist down upon the table with a\r\nheavy blow, and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force,--"I\'m\r\na going to have your life!"\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched his hand and drew it\r\nacross his mouth as if his mouth watered for me, and sat down again.\r\n\r\n"You was always in Old Orlick\'s way since ever you was a child. You goes\r\nout of his way this present night. He\'ll have no more on you. You\'re\r\ndead."\r\n\r\nI felt that I had come to the brink of my grave. For a moment I looked\r\nwildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none.\r\n\r\n"More than that," said he, folding his arms on the table again, "I won\'t\r\nhave a rag of you, I won\'t have a bone of you, left on earth. I\'ll put\r\nyour body in the kiln,--I\'d carry two such to it, on my Shoulders,--and,\r\nlet people suppose what they may of you, they shall never know nothing."\r\n\r\nMy mind, with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences\r\nof such a death. Estella\'s father would believe I had deserted him,\r\nwould be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me,\r\nwhen he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I had\r\ncalled at Miss Havisham\'s gate for only a moment; Joe and Biddy would\r\nnever know how sorry I had been that night, none would ever know what\r\nI had suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passed\r\nthrough. The death close before me was terrible, but far more terrible\r\nthan death was the dread of being misremembered after death. And\r\nso quick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn\r\ngenerations,--Estella\'s children, and their children,--while the\r\nwretch\'s words were yet on his lips.\r\n\r\n"Now, wolf," said he, "afore I kill you like any other beast,--which is\r\nwot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,--I\'ll have a good look\r\nat you and a good goad at you. O you enemy!"\r\n\r\nIt had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again; though\r\nfew could know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot, and the\r\nhopelessness of aid. But as he sat gloating over me, I was supported by\r\na scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips. Above all things, I\r\nresolved that I would not entreat him, and that I would die making some\r\nlast poor resistance to him. Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of\r\nmen were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of\r\nHeaven; melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken no\r\nfarewell, and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to\r\nme, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on my\r\nmiserable errors,--still, if I could have killed him, even in dying, I\r\nwould have done it.\r\n\r\nHe had been drinking, and his eyes were red and bloodshot. Around his\r\nneck was slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen his meat and drink\r\nslung about him in other days. He brought the bottle to his lips, and\r\ntook a fiery drink from it; and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw\r\nflash into his face.\r\n\r\n"Wolf!" said he, folding his arms again, "Old Orlick\'s a going to tell\r\nyou somethink. It was you as did for your shrew sister."\r\n\r\nAgain my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted the\r\nwhole subject of the attack upon my sister, her illness, and her death,\r\nbefore his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words.\r\n\r\n"It was you, villain," said I.\r\n\r\n"I tell you it was your doing,--I tell you it was done through you," he\r\nretorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at the\r\nvacant air between us. "I come upon her from behind, as I come upon you\r\nto-night. I giv\' it her! I left her for dead, and if there had been a\r\nlimekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you, she shouldn\'t have come\r\nto life again. But it warn\'t Old Orlick as did it; it was you. You was\r\nfavored, and he was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh?\r\nNow you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it."\r\n\r\nHe drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by his tilting of\r\nthe bottle that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctly\r\nunderstood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an\r\nend of me. I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life. I knew\r\nthat when I was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards\r\nme but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, he would do\r\nas he had done in my sister\'s case,--make all haste to the town, and\r\nbe seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses. My rapid mind\r\npursued him to the town, made a picture of the street with him in it,\r\nand contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white\r\nvapor creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved.\r\n\r\nIt was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years\r\nwhile he said a dozen words, but that what he did say presented pictures\r\nto me, and not mere words. In the excited and exalted state of my brain,\r\nI could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons without\r\nseeing them. It is impossible to overstate the vividness of these\r\nimages, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon him himself,--who\r\nwould not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring!--that I knew of\r\nthe slightest action of his fingers.\r\n\r\nWhen he had drunk this second time, he rose from the bench on which\r\nhe sat, and pushed the table aside. Then, he took up the candle, and,\r\nshading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me, stood\r\nbefore me, looking at me and enjoying the sight.\r\n\r\n"Wolf, I\'ll tell you something more. It was Old Orlick as you tumbled\r\nover on your stairs that night."\r\n\r\nI saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps. I saw the shadows of\r\nthe heavy stair-rails, thrown by the watchman\'s lantern on the wall.\r\nI saw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half open;\r\nthere, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around.\r\n\r\n"And why was Old Orlick there? I\'ll tell you something more, wolf.\r\nYou and her have pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as\r\ngetting a easy living in it goes, and I\'ve took up with new companions,\r\nand new masters. Some of \'em writes my letters when I wants \'em\r\nwrote,--do you mind?--writes my letters, wolf! They writes fifty hands;\r\nthey\'re not like sneaking you, as writes but one. I\'ve had a firm mind\r\nand a firm will to have your life, since you was down here at your\r\nsister\'s burying. I han\'t seen a way to get you safe, and I\'ve looked\r\narter you to know your ins and outs. For, says Old Orlick to himself,\r\n\'Somehow or another I\'ll have him!\' What! When I looks for you, I finds\r\nyour uncle Provis, eh?"\r\n\r\nMill Pond Bank, and Chinks\'s Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,\r\nall so clear and plain! Provis in his rooms, the signal whose use was\r\nover, pretty Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill Barley on his\r\nback, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life fast running\r\nout to sea!\r\n\r\n"You with a uncle too! Why, I know\'d you at Gargery\'s when you was so\r\nsmall a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and\r\nthumb and chucked you away dead (as I\'d thoughts o\' doing, odd times,\r\nwhen I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and you\r\nhadn\'t found no uncles then. No, not you! But when Old Orlick come for\r\nto hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the leg-iron wot Old\r\nOrlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year\r\nago, and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it, like\r\na bullock, as he means to drop you--hey?--when he come for to hear\r\nthat--hey?"\r\n\r\nIn his savage taunting, he flared the candle so close at me that I\r\nturned my face aside to save it from the flame.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he cried, laughing, after doing it again, "the burnt child dreads\r\nthe fire! Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you was\r\nsmuggling your uncle Provis away, Old Orlick\'s a match for you and\r\nknow\'d you\'d come to-night! Now I\'ll tell you something more, wolf, and\r\nthis ends it. There\'s them that\'s as good a match for your uncle Provis\r\nas Old Orlick has been for you. Let him \'ware them, when he\'s lost his\r\nnevvy! Let him \'ware them, when no man can\'t find a rag of his dear\r\nrelation\'s clothes, nor yet a bone of his body. There\'s them that can\'t\r\nand that won\'t have Magwitch,--yes, I know the name!--alive in the same\r\nland with them, and that\'s had such sure information of him when he\r\nwas alive in another land, as that he couldn\'t and shouldn\'t leave it\r\nunbeknown and put them in danger. P\'raps it\'s them that writes fifty\r\nhands, and that\'s not like sneaking you as writes but one. \'Ware\r\nCompeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!"\r\n\r\nHe flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an\r\ninstant blinding me, and turned his powerful back as he replaced the\r\nlight on the table. I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe and\r\nBiddy and Herbert, before he turned towards me again.\r\n\r\nThere was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite\r\nwall. Within this space, he now slouched backwards and forwards. His\r\ngreat strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever before, as he\r\ndid this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his sides, and with\r\nhis eyes scowling at me. I had no grain of hope left. Wild as my inward\r\nhurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me\r\ninstead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand that, unless he had\r\nresolved that I was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all\r\nhuman knowledge, he would never have told me what he had told.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden, he stopped, took the cork out of his bottle, and tossed\r\nit away. Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. He swallowed\r\nslowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he looked at\r\nme no more. The last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of his\r\nhand, and licked up. Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing\r\nhorribly, he threw the bottle from him, and stooped; and I saw in his\r\nhand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle.\r\n\r\nThe resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering\r\none vain word of appeal to him, I shouted out with all my might, and\r\nstruggled with all my might. It was only my head and my legs that I\r\ncould move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until\r\nthen unknown, that was within me. In the same instant I heard responsive\r\nshouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door, heard\r\nvoices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of men, as if\r\nit were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly out into the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAfter a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the\r\nsame place, with my head on some one\'s knee. My eyes were fixed on the\r\nladder against the wall, when I came to myself,--had opened on it before\r\nmy mind saw it,--and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I\r\nwas in the place where I had lost it.\r\n\r\nToo indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who supported\r\nme, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came between me and it\r\na face. The face of Trabb\'s boy!\r\n\r\n"I think he\'s all right!" said Trabb\'s boy, in a sober voice; "but ain\'t\r\nhe just pale though!"\r\n\r\nAt these words, the face of him who supported me looked over into mine,\r\nand I saw my supporter to be--\r\n\r\n"Herbert! Great Heaven!"\r\n\r\n"Softly," said Herbert. "Gently, Handel. Don\'t be too eager."\r\n\r\n"And our old comrade, Startop!" I cried, as he too bent over me.\r\n\r\n"Remember what he is going to assist us in," said Herbert, "and be\r\ncalm."\r\n\r\nThe allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain\r\nin my arm. "The time has not gone by, Herbert, has it? What night is\r\nto-night? How long have I been here?" For, I had a strange and\r\nstrong misgiving that I had been lying there a long time--a day and a\r\nnight,--two days and nights,--more.\r\n\r\n"The time has not gone by. It is still Monday night."\r\n\r\n"Thank God!"\r\n\r\n"And you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in," said Herbert. "But\r\nyou can\'t help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can you\r\nstand?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said I, "I can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing\r\narm."\r\n\r\nThey laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen and\r\ninflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But, they tore\r\nup their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully replaced\r\nit in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling\r\nlotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the door of the\r\ndark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the quarry on our\r\nway back. Trabb\'s boy--Trabb\'s overgrown young man now--went before us\r\nwith a lantern, which was the light I had seen come in at the door. But,\r\nthe moon was a good two hours higher than when I had last seen the sky,\r\nand the night, though rainy, was much lighter. The white vapor of the\r\nkiln was passing from us as we went by, and as I had thought a prayer\r\nbefore, I thought a thanksgiving now.\r\n\r\nEntreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,--which at\r\nfirst he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining\r\nquiet,--I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our\r\nchambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had\r\nmet in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I\r\nwas gone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the\r\ninconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His\r\nuneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an\r\nhour\'s consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, who\r\nvolunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went\r\ndown. Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his\r\nuneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he\r\nresolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at the\r\nBlue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,\r\nfinding neither, went on to Miss Havisham\'s, where they lost me.\r\nHereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when\r\nI was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh\r\nthemselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes. Among\r\nthe loungers under the Boar\'s archway happened to be Trabb\'s Boy,--true\r\nto his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no\r\nbusiness,--and Trabb\'s boy had seen me passing from Miss Havisham\'s in\r\nthe direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb\'s boy became their guide,\r\nand with him they went out to the sluice-house, though by the town way\r\nto the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went along, Herbert\r\nreflected, that I might, after all, have been brought there on some\r\ngenuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis\'s safety, and,\r\nbethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous,\r\nleft his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and went on by\r\nhimself, and stole round the house two or three times, endeavouring to\r\nascertain whether all was right within. As he could hear nothing but\r\nindistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was while my mind was so\r\nbusy), he even at last began to doubt whether I was there, when suddenly\r\nI cried out loudly, and he answered the cries, and rushed in, closely\r\nfollowed by the other two.\r\n\r\nWhen I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for our\r\nimmediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it\r\nwas, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such\r\na course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might\r\nbe fatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we\r\nrelinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the\r\npresent, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather\r\nlight of the matter to Trabb\'s boy; who, I am convinced, would have been\r\nmuch affected by disappointment, if he had known that his intervention\r\nsaved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb\'s boy was of a malignant\r\nnature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it was in his\r\nconstitution to want variety and excitement at anybody\'s expense. When\r\nwe parted, I presented him with two guineas (which seemed to meet his\r\nviews), and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of\r\nhim (which made no impression on him at all).\r\n\r\nWednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to London\r\nthat night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should then be\r\nclear away before the night\'s adventure began to be talked of. Herbert\r\ngot a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this stuff\r\ndropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear its pain\r\non the journey. It was daylight when we reached the Temple, and I went\r\nat once to bed, and lay in bed all day.\r\n\r\nMy terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for\r\nto-morrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of\r\nitself. It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the\r\nmental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon\r\nme that to-morrow was. So anxiously looked forward to, charged with such\r\nconsequences, its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near.\r\n\r\nNo precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining\r\nfrom communication with him that day; yet this again increased my\r\nrestlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing\r\nthat he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell\r\nme so. I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there was\r\nsomething more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the fact\r\nhad occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the days wore\r\non, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell,\r\nmy overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow\r\nmorning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning\r\nhead throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to\r\nhigh numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew\r\nin prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a\r\nfatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to\r\nmyself with a start, "Now it has come, and I am turning delirious!"\r\n\r\nThey kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed, and\r\ngave me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the notion\r\nI had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and the\r\nopportunity to save him was gone. About midnight I got out of bed\r\nand went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for\r\nfour-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past. It was the last\r\nself-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I slept\r\nsoundly.\r\n\r\nWednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winking\r\nlights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a\r\nmarsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, was\r\nspanned by bridges that were turning coldly gray, with here and there\r\nat top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along\r\nthe clustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the\r\nunusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn from\r\nthe river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters. From me\r\ntoo, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.\r\n\r\nHerbert lay asleep in his bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep on\r\nthe sofa. I could not dress myself without help; but I made up the fire,\r\nwhich was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. In good\r\ntime they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the sharp\r\nmorning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was still\r\nflowing towards us.\r\n\r\n"When it turns at nine o\'clock," said Herbert, cheerfully, "look out for\r\nus, and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIV\r\n\r\nIt was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind\r\nblows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.\r\nWe had our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag. Of all my worldly\r\npossessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the\r\nbag. Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were\r\nquestions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, for\r\nit was wholly set on Provis\'s safety. I only wondered for the passing\r\nmoment, as I stopped at the door and looked back, under what altered\r\ncircumstances I should next see those rooms, if ever.\r\n\r\nWe loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there, as if\r\nwe were not quite decided to go upon the water at all. Of course, I had\r\ntaken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. After\r\na little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two\r\nor three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went\r\non board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering. It was then about\r\nhigh-water,--half-past eight.\r\n\r\nOur plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being\r\nwith us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,\r\nand row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long\r\nreaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is\r\nbroad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and\r\nwhere lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we could\r\nchoose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by all night.\r\nThe steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would start from\r\nLondon at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at what time\r\nto expect them, according to where we were, and would hail the first;\r\nso that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we should have\r\nanother chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel.\r\n\r\nThe relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose\r\nwas so great to me that I felt it difficult to realize the condition in\r\nwhich I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the\r\nmovement on the river, and the moving river itself,--the road that ran\r\nwith us, seeming to sympathize with us, animate us, and encourage us\r\non,--freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so little use\r\nin the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends, and\r\nthey rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.\r\n\r\nAt that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present\r\nextent, and watermen\'s boats were far more numerous. Of barges, sailing\r\ncolliers, and coasting-traders, there were perhaps, as many as now;\r\nbut of steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part\r\nso many. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and\r\nthere that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide;\r\nthe navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a much\r\neasier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and we\r\nwent ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.\r\n\r\nOld London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate Market with its\r\noyster-boats and Dutchmen, and the White Tower and Traitor\'s Gate, and\r\nwe were in among the tiers of shipping. Here were the Leith, Aberdeen,\r\nand Glasgow steamers, loading and unloading goods, and looking immensely\r\nhigh out of the water as we passed alongside; here, were colliers by the\r\nscore and score, with the coal-whippers plunging off stages on deck, as\r\ncounterweights to measures of coal swinging up, which were then rattled\r\nover the side into barges; here, at her moorings was to-morrow\'s steamer\r\nfor Rotterdam, of which we took good notice; and here to-morrow\'s for\r\nHamburg, under whose bowsprit we crossed. And now I, sitting in the\r\nstern, could see, with a faster beating heart, Mill Pond Bank and Mill\r\nPond stairs.\r\n\r\n"Is he there?" said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Not yet."\r\n\r\n"Right! He was not to come down till he saw us. Can you see his signal?"\r\n\r\n"Not well from here; but I think I see it.--Now I see him! Pull both.\r\nEasy, Herbert. Oars!"\r\n\r\nWe touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and he was on board,\r\nand we were off again. He had a boat-cloak with him, and a black canvas\r\nbag; and he looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished.\r\n\r\n"Dear boy!" he said, putting his arm on my shoulder, as he took his\r\nseat. "Faithful dear boy, well done. Thankye, thankye!"\r\n\r\nAgain among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rusty\r\nchain-cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys, sinking for the\r\nmoment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of wood\r\nand shaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under the\r\nfigure-head of the John of Sunderland making a speech to the winds (as\r\nis done by many Johns), and the Betsy of Yarmouth with a firm formality\r\nof bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her head; in\r\nand out, hammers going in ship-builders\' yards, saws going at timber,\r\nclashing engines going at things unknown, pumps going in leaky ships,\r\ncapstans going, ships going out to sea, and unintelligible sea-creatures\r\nroaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lightermen, in and\r\nout,--out at last upon the clearer river, where the ships\' boys might\r\ntake their fenders in, no longer fishing in troubled waters with them\r\nover the side, and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind.\r\n\r\nAt the stairs where we had taken him abroad, and ever since, I had\r\nlooked warily for any token of our being suspected. I had seen none. We\r\ncertainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were not either\r\nattended or followed by any boat. If we had been waited on by any boat,\r\nI should have run in to shore, and have obliged her to go on, or to\r\nmake her purpose evident. But we held our own without any appearance of\r\nmolestation.\r\n\r\nHe had his boat-cloak on him, and looked, as I have said, a natural part\r\nof the scene. It was remarkable (but perhaps the wretched life he had\r\nled accounted for it) that he was the least anxious of any of us. He\r\nwas not indifferent, for he told me that he hoped to live to see his\r\ngentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he was not\r\ndisposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but he had no\r\nnotion of meeting danger half way. When it came upon him, he confronted\r\nit, but it must come before he troubled himself.\r\n\r\n"If you knowed, dear boy," he said to me, "what it is to sit here\r\nalonger my dear boy and have my smoke, arter having been day by day\r\nbetwixt four walls, you\'d envy me. But you don\'t know what it is."\r\n\r\n"I think I know the delights of freedom," I answered.\r\n\r\n"Ah," said he, shaking his head gravely. "But you don\'t know it equal to\r\nme. You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know it equal to\r\nme,--but I ain\'t a going to be low."\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, he\r\nshould have endangered his freedom, and even his life. But I reflected\r\nthat perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the\r\nhabit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man. I\r\nwas not far out, since he said, after smoking a little:--\r\n\r\n"You see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t\'other side the world, I\r\nwas always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, for\r\nall I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch could\r\ncome, and Magwitch could go, and nobody\'s head would be troubled about\r\nhim. They ain\'t so easy concerning me here, dear boy,--wouldn\'t be,\r\nleastwise, if they knowed where I was."\r\n\r\n"If all goes well," said I, "you will be perfectly free and safe again\r\nwithin a few hours."\r\n\r\n"Well," he returned, drawing a long breath, "I hope so."\r\n\r\n"And think so?"\r\n\r\nHe dipped his hand in the water over the boat\'s gunwale, and said,\r\nsmiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me:--\r\n\r\n"Ay, I s\'pose I think so, dear boy. We\'d be puzzled to be more quiet\r\nand easy-going than we are at present. But--it\'s a flowing so soft\r\nand pleasant through the water, p\'raps, as makes me think it--I was\r\na thinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to the\r\nbottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river\r\nwhat I catches hold of. Nor yet we can\'t no more hold their tide than\r\nI can hold this. And it\'s run through my fingers and gone, you see!"\r\nholding up his dripping hand.\r\n\r\n"But for your face I should think you were a little despondent," said I.\r\n\r\n"Not a bit on it, dear boy! It comes of flowing on so quiet, and of that\r\nthere rippling at the boat\'s head making a sort of a Sunday tune. Maybe\r\nI\'m a growing a trifle old besides."\r\n\r\nHe put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of\r\nface, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of\r\nEngland. Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been\r\nin constant terror; for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer\r\ninto the boat, and he was stepping out, I hinted that I thought he would\r\nbe safest where he was, and he said. "Do you, dear boy?" and quietly sat\r\ndown again.\r\n\r\nThe air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the\r\nsunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to lose\r\nnone of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. By\r\nimperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of the\r\nnearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the muddy\r\nbanks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend. As our\r\ncharge was wrapped in his cloak, I purposely passed within a boat or\r\ntwo\'s length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catch the\r\nstream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of a large\r\ntransport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us. And soon\r\nthe tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing,\r\nand presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were taking\r\nadvantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us\r\nin a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength of\r\nthe tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows and\r\nmudbanks.\r\n\r\nOur oarsmen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let her drive\r\nwith the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hour\'s rest\r\nproved full as much as they wanted. We got ashore among some slippery\r\nstones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about.\r\nIt was like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a\r\ndim horizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the great\r\nfloating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemed\r\nstranded and still. For now the last of the fleet of ships was round\r\nthe last low point we had headed; and the last green barge, straw-laden,\r\nwith a brown sail, had followed; and some ballast-lighters, shaped like\r\na child\'s first rude imitation of a boat, lay low in the mud; and a\r\nlittle squat shoal-lighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud\r\non stilts and crutches; and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud, and slimy\r\nstones stuck out of the mud, and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck\r\nout of the mud, and an old landing-stage and an old roofless building\r\nslipped into the mud, and all about us was stagnation and mud.\r\n\r\nWe pushed off again, and made what way we could. It was much harder work\r\nnow, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed and rowed and rowed\r\nuntil the sun went down. By that time the river had lifted us a little,\r\nso that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on the low\r\nlevel of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into black; and\r\nthere was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were the rising\r\ngrounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life, save here and\r\nthere in the foreground a melancholy gull.\r\n\r\nAs the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,\r\nwould not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, for clearly\r\nour course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find. So,\r\nthey plied their oars once more, and I looked out for anything like a\r\nhouse. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or five dull miles. It\r\nwas very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with her galley-fire smoking\r\nand flaring, looked like a comfortable home. The night was as dark by\r\nthis time as it would be until morning; and what light we had, seemed\r\nto come more from the river than the sky, as the oars in their dipping\r\nstruck at a few reflected stars.\r\n\r\nAt this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that\r\nwe were followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular\r\nintervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or\r\nother of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here and\r\nthere, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little\r\ncreek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them\r\nnervously. Sometimes, "What was that ripple?" one of us would say in a\r\nlow voice. Or another, "Is that a boat yonder?" And afterwards we would\r\nfall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with what\r\nan unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.\r\n\r\nAt length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ran\r\nalongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard\r\nby. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light\r\nto be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place enough, and I\r\ndare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good\r\nfire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various\r\nliquors to drink. Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,--"such as\r\nthey were," the landlord said. No other company was in the house than\r\nthe landlord, his wife, and a grizzled male creature, the "Jack" of the\r\nlittle causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been low-water\r\nmark too.\r\n\r\nWith this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came\r\nashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boat-hook, and all\r\nelse, and hauled her up for the night. We made a very good meal by the\r\nkitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startop\r\nwere to occupy one; I and our charge the other. We found the air as\r\ncarefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and there\r\nwere more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have\r\nthought the family possessed. But we considered ourselves well off,\r\nnotwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.\r\n\r\nWhile we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the\r\nJack--who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoes\r\non, which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, as\r\ninteresting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of\r\na drowned seaman washed ashore--asked me if we had seen a four-oared\r\ngalley going up with the tide? When I told him No, he said she must have\r\ngone down then, and yet she "took up too," when she left there.\r\n\r\n"They must ha\' thought better on\'t for some reason or another," said the\r\nJack, "and gone down."\r\n\r\n"A four-oared galley, did you say?" said I.\r\n\r\n"A four," said the Jack, "and two sitters."\r\n\r\n"Did they come ashore here?"\r\n\r\n"They put in with a stone two-gallon jar for some beer. I\'d ha\' been\r\nglad to pison the beer myself," said the Jack, "or put some rattling\r\nphysic in it."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"I know why," said the Jack. He spoke in a slushy voice, as if much mud\r\nhad washed into his throat.\r\n\r\n"He thinks," said the landlord, a weakly meditative man with a pale eye,\r\nwho seemed to rely greatly on his Jack,--"he thinks they was, what they\r\nwasn\'t."\r\n\r\n"I knows what I thinks," observed the Jack.\r\n\r\n"You thinks Custum \'Us, Jack?" said the landlord.\r\n\r\n"I do," said the Jack.\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re wrong, Jack."\r\n\r\n"AM I!"\r\n\r\nIn the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in\r\nhis views, the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off, looked into\r\nit, knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor, and put it on\r\nagain. He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he could\r\nafford to do anything.\r\n\r\n"Why, what do you make out that they done with their buttons then,\r\nJack?" asked the landlord, vacillating weakly.\r\n\r\n"Done with their buttons?" returned the Jack. "Chucked \'em overboard.\r\nSwallered \'em. Sowed \'em, to come up small salad. Done with their\r\nbuttons!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be cheeky, Jack," remonstrated the landlord, in a melancholy and\r\npathetic way.\r\n\r\n"A Custum \'Us officer knows what to do with his Buttons," said the Jack,\r\nrepeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt, "when they\r\ncomes betwixt him and his own light. A four and two sitters don\'t go\r\nhanging and hovering, up with one tide and down with another, and both\r\nwith and against another, without there being Custum \'Us at the bottom\r\nof it." Saying which he went out in disdain; and the landlord, having no\r\none to reply upon, found it impracticable to pursue the subject.\r\n\r\nThis dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy. The dismal wind\r\nwas muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, and\r\nI had a feeling that we were caged and threatened. A four-oared galley\r\nhovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly\r\ncircumstance that I could not get rid of. When I had induced Provis to\r\ngo up to bed, I went outside with my two companions (Startop by this\r\ntime knew the state of the case), and held another council. Whether we\r\nshould remain at the house until near the steamer\'s time, which would\r\nbe about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put off early in the\r\nmorning, was the question we discussed. On the whole we deemed it the\r\nbetter course to lie where we were, until within an hour or so of the\r\nsteamer\'s time, and then to get out in her track, and drift easily with\r\nthe tide. Having settled to do this, we returned into the house and went\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nI lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well for a\r\nfew hours. When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of the house\r\n(the Ship) was creaking and banging about, with noises that startled\r\nme. Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked out of the\r\nwindow. It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and,\r\nas my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I saw\r\ntwo men looking into her. They passed by under the window, looking at\r\nnothing else, and they did not go down to the landing-place which I\r\ncould discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the direction\r\nof the Nore.\r\n\r\nMy first impulse was to call up Herbert, and show him the two men going\r\naway. But reflecting, before I got into his room, which was at the back\r\nof the house and adjoined mine, that he and Startop had had a harder day\r\nthan I, and were fatigued, I forbore. Going back to my window, I could\r\nsee the two men moving over the marsh. In that light, however, I soon\r\nlost them, and, feeling very cold, lay down to think of the matter, and\r\nfell asleep again.\r\n\r\nWe were up early. As we walked to and fro, all four together, before\r\nbreakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen. Again our\r\ncharge was the least anxious of the party. It was very likely that the\r\nmen belonged to the Custom House, he said quietly, and that they had no\r\nthought of us. I tried to persuade myself that it was so,--as, indeed,\r\nit might easily be. However, I proposed that he and I should walk away\r\ntogether to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take\r\nus aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about\r\nnoon. This being considered a good precaution, soon after breakfast he\r\nand I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern.\r\n\r\nHe smoked his pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap me on\r\nthe shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who was in danger,\r\nnot he, and that he was reassuring me. We spoke very little. As we\r\napproached the point, I begged him to remain in a sheltered place, while\r\nI went on to reconnoitre; for it was towards it that the men had passed\r\nin the night. He complied, and I went on alone. There was no boat off\r\nthe point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor were there any\r\nsigns of the men having embarked there. But, to be sure, the tide was\r\nhigh, and there might have been some footpints under water.\r\n\r\nWhen he looked out from his shelter in the distance, and saw that I\r\nwaved my hat to him to come up, he rejoined me, and there we waited;\r\nsometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes moving\r\nabout to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round. We got\r\naboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer. By that time\r\nit wanted but ten minutes of one o\'clock, and we began to look out for\r\nher smoke.\r\n\r\nBut, it was half-past one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwards\r\nwe saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming on\r\nat full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity\r\nof saying good-bye to Herbert and Startop. We had all shaken hands\r\ncordially, and neither Herbert\'s eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I\r\nsaw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way\r\nahead of us, and row out into the same track.\r\n\r\nA stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer\'s smoke,\r\nby reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible,\r\ncoming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the tide,\r\nthat she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis to sit\r\nquite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily, "Trust to me,\r\ndear boy," and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was very\r\nskilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, and fallen\r\nalongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars, she kept\r\nalongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or two when we\r\npulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and looked at us\r\nattentively,--as did all the rowers; the other sitter was wrapped up,\r\nmuch as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some instruction\r\nto the steerer as he looked at us. Not a word was spoken in either boat.\r\n\r\nStartop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,\r\nand gave me the word "Hamburg," in a low voice, as we sat face to face.\r\nShe was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grew louder\r\nand louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us, when the\r\ngalley hailed us. I answered.\r\n\r\n"You have a returned Transport there," said the man who held the lines.\r\n"That\'s the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel Magwitch,\r\notherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender,\r\nand you to assist."\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,\r\nhe ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke ahead,\r\nhad got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on to\r\nour gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great\r\nconfusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and\r\nheard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but felt\r\nher driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw the\r\nsteersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner\'s shoulder, and saw\r\nthat both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide, and\r\nsaw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite\r\nfrantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start\r\nup, lean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the\r\nshrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that the\r\nface disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago. Still, in\r\nthe same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it\r\nthat I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board the steamer,\r\nand a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink from under me.\r\n\r\nIt was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand\r\nmill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was\r\ntaken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there; but\r\nour boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.\r\n\r\nWhat with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off of\r\nher steam, and her driving on, and our driving on, I could not at first\r\ndistinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of the\r\ngalley righted her with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strong\r\nstrokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently and\r\neagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it,\r\nbearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman held up\r\nhis hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and\r\ntrue before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming,\r\nbut not swimming freely. He was taken on board, and instantly manacled\r\nat the wrists and ankles.\r\n\r\nThe galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the water\r\nwas resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not\r\nunderstanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time she had\r\nbeen hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and\r\nwe were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water. The look-out was\r\nkept, long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone; but\r\neverybody knew that it was hopeless now.\r\n\r\nAt length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavern\r\nwe had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise. Here\r\nI was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,--Provis no longer,--who\r\nhad received some very severe injury in the Chest, and a deep cut in the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nHe told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the\r\nsteamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The injury to\r\nhis chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful) he thought\r\nhe had received against the side of the galley. He added that he did not\r\npretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson, but\r\nthat, in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him,\r\nthat villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had both gone\r\noverboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him (Magwitch) out of\r\nour boat, and the endeavor of his captor to keep him in it, had capsized\r\nus. He told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in\r\neach other\'s arms, and that there had been a struggle under water, and\r\nthat he had disengaged himself, struck out, and swum away.\r\n\r\nI never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me.\r\nThe officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going\r\noverboard.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked this officer\'s permission to change the prisoner\'s\r\nwet clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the\r\npublic-house, he gave it readily: merely observing that he must take\r\ncharge of everything his prisoner had about him. So the pocket-book\r\nwhich had once been in my hands passed into the officer\'s. He further\r\ngave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined to\r\naccord that grace to my two friends.\r\n\r\nThe Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone\r\ndown, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was\r\nlikeliest to come ashore. His interest in its recovery seemed to me to\r\nbe much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it\r\ntook about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may\r\nhave been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in\r\nvarious stages of decay.\r\n\r\nWe remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then Magwitch\r\nwas carried down to the galley and put on board. Herbert and Startop\r\nwere to get to London by land, as soon as they could. We had a doleful\r\nparting, and when I took my place by Magwitch\'s side, I felt that that\r\nwas my place henceforth while he lived.\r\n\r\nFor now, my repugnance to him had all melted away; and in the hunted,\r\nwounded, shackled creature who held my hand in his, I only saw a man\r\nwho had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately,\r\ngratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through a\r\nseries of years. I only saw in him a much better man than I had been to\r\nJoe.\r\n\r\nHis breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on,\r\nand often he could not repress a groan. I tried to rest him on the arm\r\nI could use, in any easy position; but it was dreadful to think that\r\nI could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt, since it was\r\nunquestionably best that he should die. That there were, still living,\r\npeople enough who were able and willing to identify him, I could not\r\ndoubt. That he would be leniently treated, I could not hope. He who had\r\nbeen presented in the worst light at his trial, who had since broken\r\nprison and had been tried again, who had returned from transportation\r\nunder a life sentence, and who had occasioned the death of the man who\r\nwas the cause of his arrest.\r\n\r\nAs we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us,\r\nand as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, I told him how\r\ngrieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake.\r\n\r\n"Dear boy," he answered, "I\'m quite content to take my chance. I\'ve seen\r\nmy boy, and he can be a gentleman without me."\r\n\r\nNo. I had thought about that, while we had been there side by side. No.\r\nApart from any inclinations of my own, I understood Wemmick\'s hint now.\r\nI foresaw that, being convicted, his possessions would be forfeited to\r\nthe Crown.\r\n\r\n"Lookee here, dear boy," said he "It\'s best as a gentleman should not be\r\nknowed to belong to me now. Only come to see me as if you come by chance\r\nalonger Wemmick. Sit where I can see you when I am swore to, for the\r\nlast o\' many times, and I don\'t ask no more."\r\n\r\n"I will never stir from your side," said I, "when I am suffered to be\r\nnear you. Please God, I will be as true to you as you have been to me!"\r\n\r\nI felt his hand tremble as it held mine, and he turned his face away\r\nas he lay in the bottom of the boat, and I heard that old sound in his\r\nthroat,--softened now, like all the rest of him. It was a good thing\r\nthat he had touched this point, for it put into my mind what I might not\r\notherwise have thought of until too late,--that he need never know how\r\nhis hopes of enriching me had perished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LV\r\n\r\nHe was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been\r\nimmediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send down\r\nfor an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once escaped, to\r\nspeak to his identity. Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had meant\r\nto depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened that\r\nthere was not at that time any prison officer in London who could give\r\nthe required evidence. I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his private\r\nhouse, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and Mr.\r\nJaggers on the prisoner\'s behalf would admit nothing. It was the sole\r\nresource; for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes\r\nwhen the witness was there, and that no power on earth could prevent its\r\ngoing against us.\r\n\r\nI imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the\r\nfate of his wealth. Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for\r\nhaving "let it slip through my fingers," and said we must memorialize\r\nby and by, and try at all events for some of it. But he did not conceal\r\nfrom me that, although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture\r\nwould not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this case to make\r\nit one of them. I understood that very well. I was not related to the\r\noutlaw, or connected with him by any recognizable tie; he had put his\r\nhand to no writing or settlement in my favor before his apprehension,\r\nand to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and I finally resolved,\r\nand ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my heart should never\r\nbe sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one.\r\n\r\nThere appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer\r\nhad hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some\r\naccurate knowledge of Magwitch\'s affairs. When his body was found, many\r\nmiles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that he\r\nwas only recognizable by the contents of his pockets, notes were still\r\nlegible, folded in a case he carried. Among these were the name of a\r\nbanking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the\r\ndesignation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of\r\ninformation were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.\r\nJaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit. His ignorance,\r\npoor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted but that my\r\ninheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers\'s aid.\r\n\r\nAfter three days\' delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over\r\nfor the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness\r\ncame, and completed the easy case. He was committed to take his trial at\r\nthe next Sessions, which would come on in a month.\r\n\r\nIt was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one\r\nevening, a good deal cast down, and said,--\r\n\r\n"My dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you."\r\n\r\nHis partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than he\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n"We shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo, and I am\r\nvery much afraid I must go, Handel, when you most need me."\r\n\r\n"Herbert, I shall always need you, because I shall always love you; but\r\nmy need is no greater now than at another time."\r\n\r\n"You will be so lonely."\r\n\r\n"I have not leisure to think of that," said I. "You know that I am\r\nalways with him to the full extent of the time allowed, and that I\r\nshould be with him all day long, if I could. And when I come away from\r\nhim, you know that my thoughts are with him."\r\n\r\nThe dreadful condition to which he was brought, was so appalling to both\r\nof us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words.\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow," said Herbert, "let the near prospect of our\r\nseparation--for, it is very near--be my justification for troubling you\r\nabout yourself. Have you thought of your future?"\r\n\r\n"No, for I have been afraid to think of any future."\r\n\r\n"But yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it must not\r\nbe dismissed. I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a few friendly\r\nwords go, with me."\r\n\r\n"I will," said I.\r\n\r\n"In this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a--"\r\n\r\nI saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, "A\r\nclerk."\r\n\r\n"A clerk. And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand (as\r\na clerk of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner. Now,\r\nHandel,--in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?"\r\n\r\nThere was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in\r\nwhich after saying "Now, Handel," as if it were the grave beginning of\r\na portentous business exordium, he had suddenly given up that tone,\r\nstretched out his honest hand, and spoken like a schoolboy.\r\n\r\n"Clara and I have talked about it again and again," Herbert pursued,\r\n"and the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears in\r\nher eyes, to say to you that, if you will live with us when we come\r\ntogether, she will do her best to make you happy, and to convince her\r\nhusband\'s friend that he is her friend too. We should get on so well,\r\nHandel!"\r\n\r\nI thanked her heartily, and I thanked him heartily, but said I could not\r\nyet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered. Firstly, my\r\nmind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly.\r\nSecondly,--Yes! Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in my\r\nthoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.\r\n\r\n"But if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any injury\r\nto your business, leave the question open for a little while--"\r\n\r\n"For any while," cried Herbert. "Six months, a year!"\r\n\r\n"Not so long as that," said I. "Two or three months at most."\r\n\r\nHerbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement,\r\nand said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must\r\ngo away at the end of the week.\r\n\r\n"And Clara?" said I.\r\n\r\n"The dear little thing," returned Herbert, "holds dutifully to her\r\nfather as long as he lasts; but he won\'t last long. Mrs. Whimple\r\nconfides to me that he is certainly going."\r\n\r\n"Not to say an unfeeling thing," said I, "he cannot do better than go."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid that must be admitted," said Herbert; "and then I shall\r\ncome back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and I\r\nwill walk quietly into the nearest church. Remember! The blessed darling\r\ncomes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into the red book,\r\nand hasn\'t a notion about her grandpapa. What a fortune for the son of\r\nmy mother!"\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert,--full\r\nof bright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,--as he sat on one of the\r\nseaport mail coaches. I went into a coffee-house to write a little note\r\nto Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to her over and\r\nover again, and then went to my lonely home,--if it deserved the name;\r\nfor it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.\r\n\r\nOn the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after an\r\nunsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door. I had not seen him\r\nalone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he had\r\ncome, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few words of\r\nexplanation in reference to that failure.\r\n\r\n"The late Compeyson," said Wemmick, "had by little and little got at the\r\nbottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it was from\r\nthe talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his people being\r\nalways in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open, seeming\r\nto have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I thought that\r\nwould be the best time for making the attempt. I can only suppose now,\r\nthat it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man, habitually to\r\ndeceive his own instruments. You don\'t blame me, I hope, Mr. Pip? I am\r\nsure I tried to serve you, with all my heart."\r\n\r\n"I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most\r\nearnestly for all your interest and friendship."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, thank you very much. It\'s a bad job," said Wemmick,\r\nscratching his head, "and I assure you I haven\'t been so cut up for a\r\nlong time. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property.\r\nDear me!"\r\n\r\n"What I think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property."\r\n\r\n"Yes, to be sure," said Wemmick. "Of course, there can be no objection\r\nto your being sorry for him, and I\'d put down a five-pound note myself\r\nto get him out of it. But what I look at is this. The late Compeyson\r\nhaving been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and being\r\nso determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have been\r\nsaved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been saved.\r\nThat\'s the difference between the property and the owner, don\'t you\r\nsee?"\r\n\r\nI invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass\r\nof grog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invitation. While he\r\nwas drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead up to\r\nit, and after having appeared rather fidgety,--\r\n\r\n"What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months."\r\n\r\n"These twelve years, more likely," said Wemmick. "Yes. I\'m going to take\r\na holiday. More than that; I\'m going to take a walk. More than that; I\'m\r\ngoing to ask you to take a walk with me."\r\n\r\nI was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then,\r\nwhen Wemmick anticipated me.\r\n\r\n"I know your engagements," said he, "and I know you are out of sorts,\r\nMr. Pip. But if you could oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.\r\nIt ain\'t a long walk, and it\'s an early one. Say it might occupy you\r\n(including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve. Couldn\'t you\r\nstretch a point and manage it?"\r\n\r\nHe had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little\r\nto do for him. I said I could manage it,--would manage it,--and he was\r\nso very much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At his\r\nparticular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half\r\npast eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.\r\n\r\nPunctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday\r\nmorning, and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as looking\r\ntighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within, there were two\r\nglasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits. The Aged must have\r\nbeen stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his\r\nbedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.\r\n\r\nWhen we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, and\r\nwere going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was\r\nconsiderably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put\r\nit over his shoulder. "Why, we are not going fishing!" said I. "No,"\r\nreturned Wemmick, "but I like to walk with one."\r\n\r\nI thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We went\r\ntowards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said\r\nsuddenly,--\r\n\r\n"Halloa! Here\'s a church!"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather\r\nsurprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea,--\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go in!"\r\n\r\nWe went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and looked all\r\nround. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets, and\r\ngetting something out of paper there.\r\n\r\n"Halloa!" said he. "Here\'s a couple of pair of gloves! Let\'s put \'em\r\non!"\r\n\r\nAs the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened\r\nto its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They\r\nwere strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side\r\ndoor, escorting a lady.\r\n\r\n"Halloa!" said Wemmick. "Here\'s Miss Skiffins! Let\'s have a wedding."\r\n\r\nThat discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now\r\nengaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white. The\r\nAged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for\r\nthe altar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so much\r\ndifficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary\r\nto put him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the\r\npillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old\r\ngentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and safe\r\nresistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on to\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nThe clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at\r\nthose fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all without\r\npreparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he took something out of\r\nhis waistcoat-pocket before the service began, "Halloa! Here\'s a ring!"\r\n\r\nI acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom; while\r\na little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby\'s, made a feint\r\nof being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of giving\r\nthe lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the clergyman\'s being\r\nunintentionally scandalized, and it happened thus. When he said, "Who\r\ngiveth this woman to be married to this man?" the old gentleman, not in\r\nthe least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at, stood\r\nmost amiably beaming at the ten commandments. Upon which, the clergyman\r\nsaid again, "WHO giveth this woman to be married to this man?" The old\r\ngentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness, the\r\nbridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice, "Now Aged P. you know; who\r\ngiveth?" To which the Aged replied with great briskness, before saying\r\nthat he gave, "All right, John, all right, my boy!" And the clergyman\r\ncame to so gloomy a pause upon it, that I had doubts for the moment\r\nwhether we should get completely married that day.\r\n\r\nIt was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church\r\nWemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it, and\r\nput the cover on again. Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future, put\r\nher white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green. "Now, Mr. Pip,"\r\nsaid Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came\r\nout, "let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a\r\nwedding-party!"\r\n\r\nBreakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so\r\naway upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle\r\nboard in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after\r\nthe solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer\r\nunwound Wemmick\'s arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in a\r\nhigh-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case, and\r\nsubmitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done.\r\n\r\nWe had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on\r\ntable, Wemmick said, "Provided by contract, you know; don\'t be afraid of\r\nit!" I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the Castle,\r\nsaluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I could.\r\n\r\nWemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with him,\r\nand wished him joy.\r\n\r\n"Thankee!" said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. "She\'s such a manager\r\nof fowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for\r\nyourself. I say, Mr. Pip!" calling me back, and speaking low. "This is\r\naltogether a Walworth sentiment, please."\r\n\r\n"I understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain," said I.\r\n\r\nWemmick nodded. "After what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers\r\nmay as well not know of it. He might think my brain was softening, or\r\nsomething of the kind."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVI\r\n\r\nHe lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between his\r\ncommittal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions. He had broken\r\ntwo ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with great\r\npain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his\r\nhurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spoke\r\nvery little. But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the\r\nfirst duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew he\r\nought to hear.\r\n\r\nBeing far too ill to remain in the common prison, he was removed, after\r\nthe first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities\r\nof being with him that I could not otherwise have had. And but for\r\nhis illness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as a\r\ndetermined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.\r\n\r\nAlthough I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the\r\nregularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record\r\non his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state. I\r\ndo not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he\r\nwasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day\r\nwhen the prison door closed upon him.\r\n\r\nThe kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man\r\nwho was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from his manner\r\nor from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he pondered\r\nover the question whether he might have been a better man under better\r\ncircumstances. But he never justified himself by a hint tending that\r\nway, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.\r\n\r\nIt happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his desperate\r\nreputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on\r\nhim. A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his eyes on me with\r\na trustful look, as if he were confident that I had seen some small\r\nredeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was a little child.\r\nAs to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and I never knew him\r\ncomplain.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be\r\nmade for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions. It\r\nwas obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long,\r\nand was refused. The trial came on at once, and, when he was put to the\r\nbar, he was seated in a chair. No objection was made to my getting\r\nclose to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that he\r\nstretched forth to me.\r\n\r\nThe trial was very short and very clear. Such things as could be said\r\nfor him were said,--how he had taken to industrious habits, and had\r\nthriven lawfully and reputably. But nothing could unsay the fact that\r\nhe had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury. It was\r\nimpossible to try him for that, and do otherwise than find him guilty.\r\n\r\nAt that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terrible experience\r\nof that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passing of\r\nSentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of Death.\r\nBut for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me,\r\nI could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that I saw\r\ntwo-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that\r\nsentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he; seated,\r\nthat he might get breath enough to keep life in him.\r\n\r\nThe whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment, down\r\nto the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering in\r\nthe rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside it\r\nat the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men\r\nand women; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and\r\nweeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There\r\nhad been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been\r\nstilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains\r\nand nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great\r\ngallery full of people,--a large theatrical audience,--looked on, as the\r\ntwo-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge\r\naddressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must\r\nsingle out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had\r\nbeen an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments and\r\npunishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years;\r\nand who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had made his\r\nescape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserable man would\r\nseem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when far removed\r\nfrom the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a peaceable and\r\nhonest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those propensities and\r\npassions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to\r\nsociety, he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance, and had\r\ncome back to the country where he was proscribed. Being here presently\r\ndenounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of\r\nJustice, but being at length seized while in the act of flight, he had\r\nresisted them, and had--he best knew whether by express design, or in\r\nthe blindness of his hardihood--caused the death of his denouncer, to\r\nwhom his whole career was known. The appointed punishment for his return\r\nto the land that had cast him out, being Death, and his case being this\r\naggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die.\r\n\r\nThe sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the\r\nglittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of\r\nlight between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,\r\nand perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,\r\nwith absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all things,\r\nand cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face in this\r\nway of light, the prisoner said, "My Lord, I have received my sentence\r\nof Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours," and sat down again.\r\nThere was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had to say\r\nto the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of them were\r\nsupported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of\r\nbravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three shook hands,\r\nand others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from\r\nthe sweet herbs lying about. He went last of all, because of having to\r\nbe helped from his chair, and to go very slowly; and he held my hand\r\nwhile all the others were removed, and while the audience got up\r\n(putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere), and\r\npointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him and me.\r\n\r\nI earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorder\'s\r\nReport was made; but, in the dread of his lingering on, I began that\r\nnight to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, setting\r\nforth my knowledge of him, and how it was that he had come back for my\r\nsake. I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when I\r\nhad finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such men\r\nin authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the\r\nCrown itself. For several days and nights after he was sentenced I took\r\nno rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed\r\nin these appeals. And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away\r\nfrom the places where they were, but felt as if they were more\r\nhopeful and less desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonable\r\nrestlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening,\r\nwandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions. To\r\nthe present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold, dusty\r\nspring night, with their ranges of stern, shut-up mansions, and their\r\nlong rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.\r\n\r\nThe daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was more\r\nstrictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an intention\r\nof carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before I sat down\r\nat his bedside, and told the officer who was always there, that I was\r\nwilling to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my\r\ndesigns. Nobody was hard with him or with me. There was duty to be\r\ndone, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer always gave me the\r\nassurance that he was worse, and some other sick prisoners in the\r\nroom, and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses,\r\n(malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be thanked!) always\r\njoined in the same report.\r\n\r\nAs the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly\r\nlooking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face\r\nuntil some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would\r\nsubside again. Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak, then\r\nhe would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to\r\nunderstand his meaning very well.\r\n\r\nThe number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change\r\nin him than I had seen yet. His eyes were turned towards the door, and\r\nlighted up as I entered.\r\n\r\n"Dear boy," he said, as I sat down by his bed: "I thought you was late.\r\nBut I knowed you couldn\'t be that."\r\n\r\n"It is just the time," said I. "I waited for it at the gate."\r\n\r\n"You always waits at the gate; don\'t you, dear boy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Not to lose a moment of the time."\r\n\r\n"Thank\'ee dear boy, thank\'ee. God bless you! You\'ve never deserted me,\r\ndear boy."\r\n\r\nI pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once\r\nmeant to desert him.\r\n\r\n"And what\'s the best of all," he said, "you\'ve been more comfortable\r\nalonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone.\r\nThat\'s best of all."\r\n\r\nHe lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he would,\r\nand love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, and a\r\nfilm came over the placid look at the white ceiling.\r\n\r\n"Are you in much pain to-day?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t complain of none, dear boy."\r\n\r\n"You never do complain."\r\n\r\nHe had spoken his last words. He smiled, and I understood his touch to\r\nmean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast. I laid it\r\nthere, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it.\r\n\r\nThe allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, I\r\nfound the governor of the prison standing near me, and he whispered,\r\n"You needn\'t go yet." I thanked him gratefully, and asked, "Might I\r\nspeak to him, if he can hear me?"\r\n\r\nThe governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The change,\r\nthough it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid\r\nlook at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately at me.\r\n\r\n"Dear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last. You understand what I\r\nsay?"\r\n\r\nA gentle pressure on my hand.\r\n\r\n"You had a child once, whom you loved and lost."\r\n\r\nA stronger pressure on my hand.\r\n\r\n"She lived, and found powerful friends. She is living now. She is a lady\r\nand very beautiful. And I love her!"\r\n\r\nWith a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my\r\nyielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips. Then,\r\nhe gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands lying on\r\nit. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away, and\r\nhis head dropped quietly on his breast.\r\n\r\nMindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men\r\nwho went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better\r\nwords that I could say beside his bed, than "O Lord, be merciful to him\r\na sinner!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVII\r\n\r\nNow that I was left wholly to myself, I gave notice of my intention\r\nto quit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could legally\r\ndetermine, and in the meanwhile to underlet them. At once I put bills\r\nup in the windows; for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any money, and\r\nbegan to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs. I ought\r\nrather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and\r\nconcentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth\r\nbeyond the fact that I was falling very ill. The late stress upon me had\r\nenabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew that it\r\nwas coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was even careless\r\nas to that.\r\n\r\nFor a day or two, I lay on the sofa, or on the floor,--anywhere,\r\naccording as I happened to sink down,--with a heavy head and aching\r\nlimbs, and no purpose, and no power. Then there came, one night which\r\nappeared of great duration, and which teemed with anxiety and horror;\r\nand when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it, I\r\nfound I could not do so.\r\n\r\nWhether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the night,\r\ngroping about for the boat that I supposed to be there; whether I had\r\ntwo or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror,\r\nnot knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had found myself\r\nlighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he was coming up\r\nthe stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had been\r\ninexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and groaning\r\nof some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making;\r\nwhether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of\r\nthe room, and a voice had called out, over and over again, that Miss\r\nHavisham was consuming within it,--these were things that I tried to\r\nsettle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that morning on\r\nmy bed. But the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them,\r\ndisordering them all, and it was through the vapor at last that I saw\r\ntwo men looking at me.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?" I asked, starting; "I don\'t know you."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," returned one of them, bending down and touching me on the\r\nshoulder, "this is a matter that you\'ll soon arrange, I dare say, but\r\nyou\'re arrested."\r\n\r\n"What is the debt?"\r\n\r\n"Hundred and twenty-three pound, fifteen, six. Jeweller\'s account, I\r\nthink."\r\n\r\n"What is to be done?"\r\n\r\n"You had better come to my house," said the man. "I keep a very nice\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\nI made some attempt to get up and dress myself. When I next attended\r\nto them, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me. I\r\nstill lay there.\r\n\r\n"You see my state," said I. "I would come with you if I could; but\r\nindeed I am quite unable. If you take me from here, I think I shall die\r\nby the way."\r\n\r\nPerhaps they replied, or argued the point, or tried to encourage me to\r\nbelieve that I was better than I thought. Forasmuch as they hang in\r\nmy memory by only this one slender thread, I don\'t know what they did,\r\nexcept that they forbore to remove me.\r\n\r\nThat I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that\r\nI often lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that I\r\nconfounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was a\r\nbrick in the house-wall, and yet entreating to be released from the\r\ngiddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of a\r\nvast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I implored\r\nin my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part in it hammered\r\noff; that I passed through these phases of disease, I know of my own\r\nremembrance, and did in some sort know at the time. That I sometimes\r\nstruggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, and\r\nthat I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, and\r\nwould then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay me\r\ndown, I also knew at the time. But, above all, I knew that there was a\r\nconstant tendency in all these people,--who, when I was very ill, would\r\npresent all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face,\r\nand would be much dilated in size,--above all, I say, I knew that there\r\nwas an extraordinary tendency in all these people, sooner or later, to\r\nsettle down into the likeness of Joe.\r\n\r\nAfter I had turned the worst point of my illness, I began to notice that\r\nwhile all its other features changed, this one consistent feature did\r\nnot change. Whoever came about me, still settled down into Joe. I opened\r\nmy eyes in the night, and I saw, in the great chair at the bedside, Joe.\r\nI opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on the window-seat, smoking\r\nhis pipe in the shaded open window, still I saw Joe. I asked for cooling\r\ndrink, and the dear hand that gave it me was Joe\'s. I sank back on\r\nmy pillow after drinking, and the face that looked so hopefully and\r\ntenderly upon me was the face of Joe.\r\n\r\nAt last, one day, I took courage, and said, "Is it Joe?"\r\n\r\nAnd the dear old home-voice answered, "Which it air, old chap."\r\n\r\n"O Joe, you break my heart! Look angry at me, Joe. Strike me, Joe. Tell\r\nme of my ingratitude. Don\'t be so good to me!"\r\n\r\nFor Joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side, and\r\nput his arm round my neck, in his joy that I knew him.\r\n\r\n"Which dear old Pip, old chap," said Joe, "you and me was ever friends.\r\nAnd when you\'re well enough to go out for a ride--what larks!"\r\n\r\nAfter which, Joe withdrew to the window, and stood with his back towards\r\nme, wiping his eyes. And as my extreme weakness prevented me from\r\ngetting up and going to him, I lay there, penitently whispering, "O God\r\nbless him! O God bless this gentle Christian man!"\r\n\r\nJoe\'s eyes were red when I next found him beside me; but I was holding\r\nhis hand, and we both felt happy.\r\n\r\n"How long, dear Joe?"\r\n\r\n"Which you meantersay, Pip, how long have your illness lasted, dear old\r\nchap?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Joe."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the end of May, Pip. To-morrow is the first of June."\r\n\r\n"And have you been here all that time, dear Joe?"\r\n\r\n"Pretty nigh, old chap. For, as I says to Biddy when the news of your\r\nbeing ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post, and\r\nbeing formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal of\r\nwalking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object on his part, and\r\nmarriage were the great wish of his hart--"\r\n\r\n"It is so delightful to hear you, Joe! But I interrupt you in what you\r\nsaid to Biddy."\r\n\r\n"Which it were," said Joe, "that how you might be amongst strangers, and\r\nthat how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such a moment\r\nmight not prove unacceptabobble. And Biddy, her word were, \'Go to him,\r\nwithout loss of time.\' That," said Joe, summing up with his judicial\r\nair, "were the word of Biddy. \'Go to him,\' Biddy say, \'without loss of\r\ntime.\' In short, I shouldn\'t greatly deceive you," Joe added, after a\r\nlittle grave reflection, "if I represented to you that the word of that\r\nyoung woman were, \'without a minute\'s loss of time.\'"\r\n\r\nThere Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be talked\r\nto in great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment at\r\nstated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that\r\nI was to submit myself to all his orders. So I kissed his hand, and lay\r\nquiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in it.\r\n\r\nEvidently Biddy had taught Joe to write. As I lay in bed looking at him,\r\nit made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the\r\npride with which he set about his letter. My bedstead, divested of its\r\ncurtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, as\r\nthe airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and\r\nthe room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my own\r\nwriting-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,\r\nJoe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from the\r\npen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his\r\nsleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer. It was\r\nnecessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow,\r\nand to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin; and\r\nwhen he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might\r\nhave been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his pen\r\nspluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was\r\non the side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen into\r\nspace, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he was\r\ntripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole\r\nhe got on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name, and had\r\nremoved a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with\r\nhis two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying the\r\neffect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there,\r\nwith unbounded satisfaction.\r\n\r\nNot to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able to\r\ntalk much, I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day. He\r\nshook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered.\r\n\r\n"Is she dead, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"Why you see, old chap," said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and by way\r\nof getting at it by degrees, "I wouldn\'t go so far as to say that, for\r\nthat\'s a deal to say; but she ain\'t--"\r\n\r\n"Living, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s nigher where it is," said Joe; "she ain\'t living."\r\n\r\n"Did she linger long, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"Arter you was took ill, pretty much about what you might call (if you\r\nwas put to it) a week," said Joe; still determined, on my account, to\r\ncome at everything by degrees.\r\n\r\n"Dear Joe, have you heard what becomes of her property?"\r\n\r\n"Well, old chap," said Joe, "it do appear that she had settled the most\r\nof it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Miss Estella. But she had\r\nwrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the\r\naccident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket. And why,\r\ndo you suppose, above all things, Pip, she left that cool four thousand\r\nunto him? \'Because of Pip\'s account of him, the said Matthew.\' I am told\r\nby Biddy, that air the writing," said Joe, repeating the legal turn as\r\nif it did him infinite good, "\'account of him the said Matthew.\' And a\r\ncool four thousand, Pip!"\r\n\r\nI never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperature of\r\nthe four thousand pounds; but it appeared to make the sum of money more\r\nto him, and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool.\r\n\r\nThis account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing I\r\nhad done. I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other relations\r\nhad any legacies?\r\n\r\n"Miss Sarah," said Joe, "she have twenty-five pound perannium fur to\r\nbuy pills, on account of being bilious. Miss Georgiana, she have twenty\r\npound down. Mrs.--what\'s the name of them wild beasts with humps, old\r\nchap?"\r\n\r\n"Camels?" said I, wondering why he could possibly want to know.\r\n\r\nJoe nodded. "Mrs. Camels," by which I presently understood he meant\r\nCamilla, "she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in\r\nspirits when she wake up in the night."\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to give\r\nme great confidence in Joe\'s information. "And now," said Joe, "you\r\nain\'t that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor one\r\nadditional shovelful to-day. Old Orlick he\'s been a bustin\' open a\r\ndwelling-ouse."\r\n\r\n"Whose?" said I.\r\n\r\n"Not, I grant you, but what his manners is given to blusterous," said\r\nJoe, apologetically; "still, a Englishman\'s ouse is his Castle, and\r\ncastles must not be busted \'cept when done in war time. And wotsume\'er\r\nthe failings on his part, he were a corn and seedsman in his hart."\r\n\r\n"Is it Pumblechook\'s house that has been broken into, then?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, Pip," said Joe; "and they took his till, and they took his\r\ncash-box, and they drinked his wine, and they partook of his wittles,\r\nand they slapped his face, and they pulled his nose, and they tied him\r\nup to his bedpust, and they giv\' him a dozen, and they stuffed his\r\nmouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out. But he knowed\r\nOrlick, and Orlick\'s in the county jail."\r\n\r\nBy these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation. I was slow\r\nto gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak, and Joe\r\nstayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again.\r\n\r\nFor the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need,\r\nthat I was like a child in his hands. He would sit and talk to me in the\r\nold confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the old unassertive\r\nprotecting way, so that I would half believe that all my life since the\r\ndays of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that\r\nwas gone. He did everything for me except the household work, for which\r\nhe had engaged a very decent woman, after paying off the laundress on\r\nhis first arrival. "Which I do assure you, Pip," he would often say, in\r\nexplanation of that liberty; "I found her a tapping the spare bed, like\r\na cask of beer, and drawing off the feathers in a bucket, for sale.\r\nWhich she would have tapped yourn next, and draw\'d it off with you a\r\nlaying on it, and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in\r\nthe soup-tureen and wegetable-dishes, and the wine and spirits in your\r\nWellington boots."\r\n\r\nWe looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we had\r\nonce looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship. And when the day\r\ncame, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up,\r\ntook me in his arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I were\r\nstill the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of\r\nthe wealth of his great nature.\r\n\r\nAnd Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country,\r\nwhere the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass,\r\nand sweet summer scents filled all the air. The day happened to be\r\nSunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought\r\nhow it had grown and changed, and how the little wild-flowers had been\r\nforming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day and\r\nby night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burning\r\nand tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed\r\nthere came like a check upon my peace. But when I heard the Sunday\r\nbells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I felt\r\nthat I was not nearly thankful enough,--that I was too weak yet to be\r\neven that,--and I laid my head on Joe\'s shoulder, as I had laid it long\r\nago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too much\r\nfor my young senses.\r\n\r\nMore composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used\r\nto talk, lying on the grass at the old Battery. There was no change\r\nwhatever in Joe. Exactly what he had been in my eyes then, he was in my\r\neyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back again, and he lifted me out, and carried me--so\r\neasily!--across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventful\r\nChristmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes. We had not yet\r\nmade any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much of\r\nmy late history he was acquainted with. I was so doubtful of myself now,\r\nand put so much trust in him, that I could not satisfy myself whether I\r\nought to refer to it when he did not.\r\n\r\n"Have you heard, Joe," I asked him that evening, upon further\r\nconsideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window, "who my patron was?"\r\n\r\n"I heerd," returned Joe, "as it were not Miss Havisham, old chap."\r\n\r\n"Did you hear who it was, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"Well! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv\' you\r\nthe bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip."\r\n\r\n"So it was."\r\n\r\n"Astonishing!" said Joe, in the placidest way.\r\n\r\n"Did you hear that he was dead, Joe?" I presently asked, with increasing\r\ndiffidence.\r\n\r\n"Which? Him as sent the bank-notes, Pip?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking rather\r\nevasively at the window-seat, "as I did hear tell that how he were\r\nsomething or another in a general way in that direction."\r\n\r\n"Did you hear anything of his circumstances, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"Not partickler, Pip."\r\n\r\n"If you would like to hear, Joe--" I was beginning, when Joe got up and\r\ncame to my sofa.\r\n\r\n"Lookee here, old chap," said Joe, bending over me. "Ever the best of\r\nfriends; ain\'t us, Pip?"\r\n\r\nI was ashamed to answer him.\r\n\r\n"Wery good, then," said Joe, as if I had answered; "that\'s all right;\r\nthat\'s agreed upon. Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as\r\nbetwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary? There\'s subjects enough\r\nas betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. Lord! To think of your\r\npoor sister and her Rampages! And don\'t you remember Tickler?"\r\n\r\n"I do indeed, Joe."\r\n\r\n"Lookee here, old chap," said Joe. "I done what I could to keep you\r\nand Tickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to my\r\ninclinations. For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, it\r\nwere not so much," said Joe, in his favorite argumentative way, "that\r\nshe dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her, but that\r\nshe dropped into you always heavier for it. I noticed that. It ain\'t a\r\ngrab at a man\'s whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man (to which your\r\nsister was quite welcome), that \'ud put a man off from getting a little\r\nchild out of punishment. But when that little child is dropped into\r\nheavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally up\r\nand says to himself, \'Where is the good as you are a doing? I grant you\r\nI see the \'arm,\' says the man, \'but I don\'t see the good. I call upon\r\nyou, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.\'"\r\n\r\n"The man says?" I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.\r\n\r\n"The man says," Joe assented. "Is he right, that man?"\r\n\r\n"Dear Joe, he is always right."\r\n\r\n"Well, old chap," said Joe, "then abide by your words. If he\'s always\r\nright (which in general he\'s more likely wrong), he\'s right when he says\r\nthis: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when you\r\nwas a little child, you kep it mostly because you know\'d as J. Gargery\'s\r\npower to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal to his\r\ninclinations. Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two sech, and do\r\nnot let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy giv\' herself a\r\ndeal o\' trouble with me afore I left (for I am almost awful dull), as I\r\nshould view it in this light, and, viewing it in this light, as I should\r\nso put it. Both of which," said Joe, quite charmed with his logical\r\narrangement, "being done, now this to you a true friend, say. Namely.\r\nYou mustn\'t go a overdoing on it, but you must have your supper and your\r\nwine and water, and you must be put betwixt the sheets."\r\n\r\nThe delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact and\r\nkindness with which Biddy--who with her woman\'s wit had found me out so\r\nsoon--had prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind. But\r\nwhether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had\r\nall dissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nAnother thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to\r\ndevelop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension\r\nof, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less\r\neasy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dear\r\nfellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names,\r\nthe dear "old Pip, old chap," that now were music in my ears. I too had\r\nfallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let me. But,\r\nimperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe\'s hold upon them began\r\nto slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to\r\nunderstand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was\r\nall mine.\r\n\r\nAh! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that\r\nin prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off? Had I given\r\nJoe\'s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got\r\nstronger, his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had better\r\nloosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?\r\n\r\nIt was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the\r\nTemple Gardens leaning on Joe\'s arm, that I saw this change in him very\r\nplainly. We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking at the\r\nriver, and I chanced to say as we got up,--\r\n\r\n"See, Joe! I can walk quite strongly. Now, you shall see me walk back by\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"Which do not overdo it, Pip," said Joe; "but I shall be happy fur to\r\nsee you able, sir."\r\n\r\nThe last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I walked no\r\nfurther than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be\r\nweaker than I was, and asked Joe for his arm. Joe gave it me, but was\r\nthoughtful.\r\n\r\nI, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growing\r\nchange in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts. That I\r\nwas ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had come\r\ndown to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not\r\nquite an unworthy one. He would want to help me out of his little\r\nsavings, I knew, and I knew that he ought not to help me, and that I\r\nmust not suffer him to do it.\r\n\r\nIt was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went to\r\nbed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,--to-morrow being\r\nSunday,--and would begin my new course with the new week. On Monday\r\nmorning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this\r\nlast vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts\r\n(that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to go\r\nout to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever. As I\r\ncleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he had sympathetically\r\narrived at a resolution too.\r\n\r\nWe had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and\r\nthen walked in the fields.\r\n\r\n"I feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe," I said.\r\n\r\n"Dear old Pip, old chap, you\'re a\'most come round, sir."\r\n\r\n"It has been a memorable time for me, Joe."\r\n\r\n"Likeways for myself, sir," Joe returned.\r\n\r\n"We have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget. There were\r\ndays once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shall\r\nforget these."\r\n\r\n"Pip," said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, "there has\r\nbeen larks. And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us--have been."\r\n\r\nAt night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he had done\r\nall through my recovery. He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well\r\nas in the morning?\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear Joe, quite."\r\n\r\n"And are always a getting stronger, old chap?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear Joe, steadily."\r\n\r\nJoe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand, and\r\nsaid, in what I thought a husky voice, "Good night!"\r\n\r\nWhen I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full of\r\nmy resolution to tell Joe all, without delay. I would tell him before\r\nbreakfast. I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him;\r\nfor, it was the first day I had been up early. I went to his room, and\r\nhe was not there. Not only was he not there, but his box was gone.\r\n\r\nI hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter. These\r\nwere its brief contents:--\r\n\r\n"Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear\r\nPip and will do better without JO.\r\n\r\n"P.S. Ever the best of friends."\r\n\r\nEnclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I\r\nhad been arrested. Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that my\r\ncreditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should be quite\r\nrecovered. I had never dreamed of Joe\'s having paid the money; but Joe\r\nhad paid it, and the receipt was in his name.\r\n\r\nWhat remained for me now, but to follow him to the dear old forge, and\r\nthere to have out my disclosure to him, and my penitent remonstrance\r\nwith him, and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved\r\nSecondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts,\r\nand had formed into a settled purpose?\r\n\r\nThe purpose was, that I would go to Biddy, that I would show her how\r\nhumbled and repentant I came back, that I would tell her how I had lost\r\nall I once hoped for, that I would remind her of our old confidences in\r\nmy first unhappy time. Then I would say to her, "Biddy, I think you once\r\nliked me very well, when my errant heart, even while it strayed away\r\nfrom you, was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since.\r\nIf you can like me only half as well once more, if you can take me with\r\nall my faults and disappointments on my head, if you can receive me like\r\na forgiven child (and indeed I am as sorry, Biddy, and have as much need\r\nof a hushing voice and a soothing hand), I hope I am a little worthier\r\nof you that I was,--not much, but a little. And, Biddy, it shall rest\r\nwith you to say whether I shall work at the forge with Joe, or whether I\r\nshall try for any different occupation down in this country, or whether\r\nwe shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which\r\nI set aside, when it was offered, until I knew your answer. And now,\r\ndear Biddy, if you can tell me that you will go through the world with\r\nme, you will surely make it a better world for me, and me a better man\r\nfor it, and I will try hard to make it a better world for you."\r\n\r\nSuch was my purpose. After three days more of recovery, I went down to\r\nthe old place to put it in execution. And how I sped in it is all I have\r\nleft to tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVIII\r\n\r\nThe tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down\r\nto my native place and its neighborhood before I got there. I found the\r\nBlue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found that it made a\r\ngreat change in the Boar\'s demeanour. Whereas the Boar had cultivated\r\nmy good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property,\r\nthe Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going out of\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nIt was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had so\r\noften made so easily. The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom,\r\nwhich was engaged (probably by some one who had expectations), and\r\ncould only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and\r\npost-chaises up the yard. But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as\r\nin the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me, and the\r\nquality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolled\r\nround by Satis House. There were printed bills on the gate and on bits\r\nof carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction of\r\nthe Household Furniture and Effects, next week. The House itself was to\r\nbe sold as old building materials, and pulled down. LOT 1 was marked in\r\nwhitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew house; LOT 2 on that part of\r\nthe main building which had been so long shut up. Other lots were marked\r\noff on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torn down to\r\nmake room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low in the dust\r\nand was withered already. Stepping in for a moment at the open gate, and\r\nlooking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no\r\nbusiness there, I saw the auctioneer\'s clerk walking on the casks and\r\ntelling them off for the information of a catalogue-compiler, pen in\r\nhand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so often\r\npushed along to the tune of Old Clem.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back to my breakfast in the Boar\'s coffee-room, I found Mr.\r\nPumblechook conversing with the landlord. Mr. Pumblechook (not improved\r\nin appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and\r\naddressed me in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n"Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else could be\r\nexpected! what else could be expected!"\r\n\r\nAs he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as I was\r\nbroken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.\r\n\r\n"William," said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, "put a muffin on table.\r\nAnd has it come to this! Has it come to this!"\r\n\r\nI frowningly sat down to my breakfast. Mr. Pumblechook stood over me and\r\npoured out my tea--before I could touch the teapot--with the air of a\r\nbenefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.\r\n\r\n"William," said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, "put the salt on. In\r\nhappier times," addressing me, "I think you took sugar? And did you take\r\nmilk? You did. Sugar and milk. William, bring a watercress."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said I, shortly, "but I don\'t eat watercresses."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t eat \'em," returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding\r\nhis head several times, as if he might have expected that, and as if\r\nabstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall. "True.\r\nThe simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn\'t bring any, William."\r\n\r\nI went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand over\r\nme, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.\r\n\r\n"Little more than skin and bone!" mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. "And yet\r\nwhen he went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spread afore\r\nhim my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!"\r\n\r\nThis reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner\r\nin which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, "May I?"\r\nand the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the\r\nsame fat five fingers.\r\n\r\n"Hah!" he went on, handing me the bread and butter. "And air you a going\r\nto Joseph?"\r\n\r\n"In heaven\'s name," said I, firing in spite of myself, "what does it\r\nmatter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone."\r\n\r\nIt was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook\r\nthe opportunity he wanted.\r\n\r\n"Yes, young man," said he, releasing the handle of the article in\r\nquestion, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the\r\nbehoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, "I will leave that teapot\r\nalone. You are right, young man. For once you are right. I forgit myself\r\nwhen I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to wish your frame,\r\nexhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality, to be stimilated\r\nby the \'olesome nourishment of your forefathers. And yet," said\r\nPumblechook, turning to the landlord and waiter, and pointing me out at\r\narm\'s length, "this is him as I ever sported with in his days of happy\r\ninfancy! Tell me not it cannot be; I tell you this is him!"\r\n\r\nA low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be\r\nparticularly affected.\r\n\r\n"This is him," said Pumblechook, "as I have rode in my shay-cart. This\r\nis him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him untoe the sister\r\nof which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana M\'ria from\r\nher own mother, let him deny it if he can!"\r\n\r\nThe waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave\r\nthe case a black look.\r\n\r\n"Young man," said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the old\r\nfashion, "you air a going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, you\r\nask me, where you air a going? I say to you, Sir, you air a going to\r\nJoseph."\r\n\r\nThe waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air\r\nof saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and\r\nconclusive, "I will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires of\r\nthe Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is William,\r\nwhich his father\'s name was Potkins if I do not deceive myself."\r\n\r\n"You do not, sir," said William.\r\n\r\n"In their presence," pursued Pumblechook, "I will tell you, young\r\nman, what to say to Joseph. Says you, "Joseph, I have this day seen\r\nmy earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun\'s. I will name no\r\nnames, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I have\r\nseen that man."\r\n\r\n"I swear I don\'t see him here," said I.\r\n\r\n"Say that likewise," retorted Pumblechook. "Say you said that, and even\r\nJoseph will probably betray surprise."\r\n\r\n"There you quite mistake him," said I. "I know better."\r\n\r\n"Says you," Pumblechook went on, "\'Joseph, I have seen that man, and\r\nthat man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. He knows your\r\ncharacter, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and\r\nignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, and he knows my want of\r\ngratitoode. Yes, Joseph,\' says you," here Pumblechook shook his head and\r\nhand at me, "\'he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode.\r\nHe knows it, Joseph, as none can. You do not know it, Joseph, having no\r\ncall to know it, but that man do.\'"\r\n\r\nWindy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the face\r\nto talk thus to mine.\r\n\r\n"Says you, \'Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now\r\nrepeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger of\r\nProvidence. He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw it\r\nplain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. Reward of ingratitoode to his\r\nearliest benefactor, and founder of fortun\'s. But that man said he did\r\nnot repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not at all. It was right to do\r\nit, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would do it\r\nagain.\'"\r\n\r\n"It\'s pity," said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted breakfast,\r\n"that the man did not say what he had done and would do again."\r\n\r\n"Squires of the Boar!" Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord, "and\r\nWilliam! I have no objections to your mentioning, either up town or down\r\ntown, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do it, kind to\r\ndo it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again."\r\n\r\nWith those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air,\r\nand left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by\r\nthe virtues of that same indefinite "it." I was not long after him in\r\nleaving the house too, and when I went down the High Street I saw him\r\nholding forth (no doubt to the same effect) at his shop door to a select\r\ngroup, who honored me with very unfavorable glances as I passed on the\r\nopposite side of the way.\r\n\r\nBut, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whose\r\ngreat forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be,\r\ncontrasted with this brazen pretender. I went towards them slowly, for\r\nmy limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew\r\nnearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness\r\nfurther and further behind.\r\n\r\nThe June weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks were soaring\r\nhigh over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more beautiful\r\nand peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet. Many pleasant\r\npictures of the life that I would lead there, and of the change for the\r\nbetter that would come over my character when I had a guiding spirit at\r\nmy side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I had proved, beguiled\r\nmy way. They awakened a tender emotion in me; for my heart was softened\r\nby my return, and such a change had come to pass, that I felt like one\r\nwho was toiling home barefoot from distant travel, and whose wanderings\r\nhad lasted many years.\r\n\r\nThe schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen; but, the\r\nlittle roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness\'\r\nsake, took me past it. I was disappointed to find that the day was a\r\nholiday; no children were there, and Biddy\'s house was closed. Some\r\nhopeful notion of seeing her, busily engaged in her daily duties, before\r\nshe saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.\r\n\r\nBut the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it under\r\nthe sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe\'s hammer. Long\r\nafter I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I heard it\r\nand found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes were there, and the\r\nwhite thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, and their\r\nleaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, the clink of\r\nJoe\'s hammer was not in the midsummer wind.\r\n\r\nAlmost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, I saw\r\nit at last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, no glittering\r\nshower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and still.\r\n\r\nBut the house was not deserted, and the best parlor seemed to be in use,\r\nfor there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and the window\r\nwas open and gay with flowers. I went softly towards it, meaning to peep\r\nover the flowers, when Joe and Biddy stood before me, arm in arm.\r\n\r\nAt first Biddy gave a cry, as if she thought it was my apparition, but\r\nin another moment she was in my embrace. I wept to see her, and she wept\r\nto see me; I, because she looked so fresh and pleasant; she, because I\r\nlooked so worn and white.\r\n\r\n"But dear Biddy, how smart you are!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear Pip."\r\n\r\n"And Joe, how smart you are!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear old Pip, old chap."\r\n\r\nI looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then--\r\n\r\n"It\'s my wedding-day!" cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, "and I am\r\nmarried to Joe!"\r\n\r\nThey had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down on\r\nthe old deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and Joe\'s\r\nrestoring touch was on my shoulder. "Which he warn\'t strong enough, my\r\ndear, fur to be surprised," said Joe. And Biddy said, "I ought to\r\nhave thought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy." They were both so\r\noverjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming to\r\nthem, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their day\r\ncomplete!\r\n\r\nMy first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never breathed\r\nthis last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while he was with me in my\r\nillness, had it risen to my lips! How irrevocable would have been his\r\nknowledge of it, if he had remained with me but another hour!\r\n\r\n"Dear Biddy," said I, "you have the best husband in the whole world,\r\nand if you could have seen him by my bed you would have--But no, you\r\ncouldn\'t love him better than you do."\r\n\r\n"No, I couldn\'t indeed," said Biddy.\r\n\r\n"And, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she will\r\nmake you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble Joe!"\r\n\r\nJoe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve before\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n"And Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and are in\r\ncharity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you\r\nhave done for me, and all I have so ill repaid! And when I say that I am\r\ngoing away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that I shall\r\nnever rest until I have worked for the money with which you have kept me\r\nout of prison, and have sent it to you, don\'t think, dear Joe and Biddy,\r\nthat if I could repay it a thousand times over, I suppose I could cancel\r\na farthing of the debt I owe you, or that I would do so if I could!"\r\n\r\nThey were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n"But I must say more. Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to love,\r\nand that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter\r\nnight, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for\r\never. Don\'t tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; don\'t tell him, Biddy,\r\nthat I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I honored you both,\r\nbecause you were both so good and true, and that, as your child, I said\r\nit would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I did."\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t a going," said Joe, from behind his sleeve, "to tell him\r\nnothink o\' that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain\'t. Nor yet no one ain\'t."\r\n\r\n"And now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind\r\nhearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear you\r\nsay the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and then\r\nI shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better of\r\nme, in the time to come!"\r\n\r\n"O dear old Pip, old chap," said Joe. "God knows as I forgive you, if I\r\nhave anythink to forgive!"\r\n\r\n"Amen! And God knows I do!" echoed Biddy.\r\n\r\n"Now let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few\r\nminutes by myself. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go\r\nwith me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say\r\ngood-bye!"\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition\r\nwith my creditors,--who gave me ample time to pay them in full,--and I\r\nwent out and joined Herbert. Within a month, I had quitted England,\r\nand within two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co., and within four\r\nmonths I assumed my first undivided responsibility. For the beam across\r\nthe parlor ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under\r\nold Bill Barley\'s growls and was at peace, and Herbert had gone away to\r\nmarry Clara, and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until\r\nhe brought her back.\r\n\r\nMany a year went round before I was a partner in the House; but I lived\r\nhappily with Herbert and his wife, and lived frugally, and paid my\r\ndebts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe. It\r\nwas not until I became third in the Firm, that Clarriker betrayed me to\r\nHerbert; but he then declared that the secret of Herbert\'s partnership\r\nhad been long enough upon his conscience, and he must tell it. So he\r\ntold it, and Herbert was as much moved as amazed, and the dear fellow\r\nand I were not the worse friends for the long concealment. I must not\r\nleave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House, or that we made\r\nmints of money. We were not in a grand way of business, but we had a\r\ngood name, and worked for our profits, and did very well. We owed so\r\nmuch to Herbert\'s ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often\r\nwondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude, until I\r\nwas one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitude\r\nhad never been in him at all, but had been in me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIX\r\n\r\nFor eleven years, I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodily\r\neyes,--though they had both been often before my fancy in the\r\nEast,--when, upon an evening in December, an hour or two after dark, I\r\nlaid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door. I touched it\r\nso softly that I was not heard, and looked in unseen. There, smoking his\r\npipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight, as hale and as strong as\r\never, though a little gray, sat Joe; and there, fenced into the corner\r\nwith Joe\'s leg, and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire,\r\nwas--I again!\r\n\r\n"We giv\' him the name of Pip for your sake, dear old chap," said Joe,\r\ndelighted, when I took another stool by the child\'s side (but I did not\r\nrumple his hair), "and we hoped he might grow a little bit like you, and\r\nwe think he do."\r\n\r\nI thought so too, and I took him out for a walk next morning, and we\r\ntalked immensely, understanding one another to perfection. And I took\r\nhim down to the churchyard, and set him on a certain tombstone there,\r\nand he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the\r\nmemory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife\r\nof the Above.\r\n\r\n"Biddy," said I, when I talked with her after dinner, as her little girl\r\nlay sleeping in her lap, "you must give Pip to me one of these days; or\r\nlend him, at all events."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Biddy, gently. "You must marry."\r\n\r\n"So Herbert and Clara say, but I don\'t think I shall, Biddy. I have so\r\nsettled down in their home, that it\'s not at all likely. I am already\r\nquite an old bachelor."\r\n\r\nBiddy looked down at her child, and put its little hand to her lips, and\r\nthen put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine.\r\nThere was something in the action, and in the light pressure of Biddy\'s\r\nwedding-ring, that had a very pretty eloquence in it.\r\n\r\n"Dear Pip," said Biddy, "you are sure you don\'t fret for her?"\r\n\r\n"O no,--I think not, Biddy."\r\n\r\n"Tell me as an old, old friend. Have you quite forgotten her?\r\n\r\n"My dear Biddy, I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a\r\nforemost place there, and little that ever had any place there. But that\r\npoor dream, as I once used to call it, has all gone by, Biddy,--all gone\r\nby!"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I knew, while I said those words, that I secretly intended\r\nto revisit the site of the old house that evening, alone, for her sake.\r\nYes, even so. For Estella\'s sake.\r\n\r\nI had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life, and as being\r\nseparated from her husband, who had used her with great cruelty, and who\r\nhad become quite renowned as a compound of pride, avarice, brutality,\r\nand meanness. And I had heard of the death of her husband, from an\r\naccident consequent on his ill-treatment of a horse. This release had\r\nbefallen her some two years before; for anything I knew, she was married\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe early dinner hour at Joe\'s, left me abundance of time, without\r\nhurrying my talk with Biddy, to walk over to the old spot before dark.\r\nBut, what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think\r\nof old times, the day had quite declined when I came to the place.\r\n\r\nThere was no house now, no brewery, no building whatever left, but the\r\nwall of the old garden. The cleared space had been enclosed with a rough\r\nfence, and looking over it, I saw that some of the old ivy had struck\r\nroot anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin. A gate in\r\nthe fence standing ajar, I pushed it open, and went in.\r\n\r\nA cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon, and the moon was not yet\r\nup to scatter it. But, the stars were shining beyond the mist, and the\r\nmoon was coming, and the evening was not dark. I could trace out where\r\nevery part of the old house had been, and where the brewery had been,\r\nand where the gates, and where the casks. I had done so, and was looking\r\nalong the desolate garden walk, when I beheld a solitary figure in it.\r\n\r\nThe figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced. It had been moving\r\ntowards me, but it stood still. As I drew nearer, I saw it to be the\r\nfigure of a woman. As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away, when\r\nit stopped, and let me come up with it. Then, it faltered, as if much\r\nsurprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out,--\r\n\r\n"Estella!"\r\n\r\n"I am greatly changed. I wonder you know me."\r\n\r\nThe freshness of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable\r\nmajesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it,\r\nI had seen before; what I had never seen before, was the saddened,\r\nsoftened light of the once proud eyes; what I had never felt before was\r\nthe friendly touch of the once insensible hand.\r\n\r\nWe sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, "After so many years,\r\nit is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here where our\r\nfirst meeting was! Do you often come back?"\r\n\r\n"I have never been here since."\r\n\r\n"Nor I."\r\n\r\nThe moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white\r\nceiling, which had passed away. The moon began to rise, and I thought of\r\nthe pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had heard on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nEstella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us.\r\n\r\n"I have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have been\r\nprevented by many circumstances. Poor, poor old place!"\r\n\r\nThe silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and\r\nthe same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes. Not knowing\r\nthat I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of them, she said\r\nquietly,--\r\n\r\n"Were you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left in this\r\ncondition?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Estella."\r\n\r\n"The ground belongs to me. It is the only possession I have not\r\nrelinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I\r\nhave kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I\r\nmade in all the wretched years."\r\n\r\n"Is it to be built on?"\r\n\r\n"At last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. And\r\nyou," she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,--"you\r\nlive abroad still?"\r\n\r\n"Still."\r\n\r\n"And do well, I am sure?"\r\n\r\n"I work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore--yes, I do\r\nwell."\r\n\r\n"I have often thought of you," said Estella.\r\n\r\n"Have you?"\r\n\r\n"Of late, very often. There was a long hard time when I kept far from me\r\nthe remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant\r\nof its worth. But since my duty has not been incompatible with the\r\nadmission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart."\r\n\r\n"You have always held your place in my heart," I answered.\r\n\r\nAnd we were silent again until she spoke.\r\n\r\n"I little thought," said Estella, "that I should take leave of you in\r\ntaking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so."\r\n\r\n"Glad to part again, Estella? To me, parting is a painful thing. To me,\r\nthe remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful."\r\n\r\n"But you said to me," returned Estella, very earnestly, "\'God bless you,\r\nGod forgive you!\' And if you could say that to me then, you will not\r\nhesitate to say that to me now,--now, when suffering has been stronger\r\nthan all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart\r\nused to be. I have been bent and broken, but--I hope--into a better\r\nshape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me we are\r\nfriends."\r\n\r\n"We are friends," said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose from\r\nthe bench.\r\n\r\n"And will continue friends apart," said Estella.\r\n\r\nI took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as\r\nthe morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so the\r\nevening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil\r\nlight they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting from her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GREAT EXPECTATIONS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1400-8.txt or 1400-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/4/0/1400/\r\n\r\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
