aS'I dont agree with sacrificing sleep. Research shows you are more energetic \nand more efficient with full nights quality sleep. You get more done in \nless time with less error because your brain is functioning better. You \nalso feel better and your body can recover and perform better with the \nextra sleep. So your not wasting your time sleeping a full 8 hours, like \nmany think. Id actually argue your wasting time by not sleeping because you \nare moving slower in your waking hours. Of course there might be an \nexception on one particualar night, but it shouldnt be the go to answer. \nYou want sucess? Perform better in less time, and dont waste time when you \nare awake. Think smarter about how bad you want it, and stack the odds of \nyou suceeding in your favor.'
p548
aS'Agreed with most of it except for sleep....You go without sleep for long \nperiods of time you will fuck your self over....not a good idea. Growth \nHormone is produced in your body while you are sleep between the times of \n9p-4am....dont lose sleep'

One is the greatest player in Barcelona\'s \nhistory and made it surrounded by the best players in the best team of \nhistory (Barcelona 2009-2016) and the another was the man who changed a \nteam forever and made it surrounded by average players, then surrounded by \nvery good players but never as good as the teammates Messi had (Nobody ever \ndare to bring up the names of Xavi and Iniesta \'cause they weren\'t that \ngood in Ronaldinho\'s best times, definitely not). Adding, you could have \nnever imagined a "Barcelona 7-0 Valencia" in Ronaldinho\'s times. The \nspanish football became the last 6 years in the most uneven I\'ve seen in my \nlife.'
