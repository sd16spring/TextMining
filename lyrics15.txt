<i>[CL:]</i><br>
Balmain to KTZ<br>
Many style from A to Z<br>
Jeremy Scott Givenchy<br>
Bitch You ain't got shit on me<br>
Chrome hearts<br>
Fendi furs<br>
Dripped in shits you never heard<br>
2-n-e-1<br>
<br>
<i>[CL:]</i><br>
Ridin' down Seoul city<br>
Black on black Lamborghini<br>
Haters can't never see me<br>
Come and get me, too slow<br>
I'm 'bout that paper chasing<br>
Body, fly face amazing<br>
Burn burn keeps it blazin'<br>
Too hot to handle, can't touch this<br>
<br>
<i>[CL:]</i><br>
You think you with it with it<br>
But you can't hit it hit it<br>
You know I got it got it<br>

And we stick you for your dough dough<br>

<i>[BOM:]</i><br>

<i>[CL:]</i><br>
So watch out when we come for you<br>
Cause playtime it's done for you<br>
It's my time and it's my time<br>
I'm pound for pound, best to ever come around<br>
Be patient it's never been done<br>
Asians we rise with the sun<br>
Invasion, no mercy<br>
Takeover, we thirsty<br>
<br>
<i>[CL:]</i><br>
Every show we shut it down<br>
Blow your speakers with this sound<br>
Build you up then break you down<br>
We comin' to your town<br>
<br>
<i>[MINJI:]</i><br>
