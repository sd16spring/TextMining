Jerome\r\n\r\n1901\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GHOST OF THE MARCHIONESS OF APPLEFORD\r\n\r\n\r\n|This is the story, among others, of Henry the waiter--or, as\r\nhe now prefers to call himself, Henri--told to me in the long\r\ndining-room of the Riffel Alp Hotel, where I once stayed for a\r\nmelancholy week "between seasons," sharing the echoing emptiness\r\nof the place with two maiden ladies, who talked all day to one\r\nanother in frightened whispers. Henry\'s construction I have\r\ndiscarded for its amateurishness; his method being generally to\r\ncommence a story at the end, and then, working backwards to the\r\nbeginning, wind up with the middle. But in all other respects I\r\nhave endeavoured to retain his method, which was individual;\r\nand this, I think, is the story as he would have told it to me\r\nhimself, had he told it in this order:\r\n\r\nMy first place--well to be honest, it was a coffee shop in the\r\nMile End Road--I\'m not ashamed of it. We all have our beginnings.\r\nYoung "Kipper," as we called him--he had no name of his own, not\r\nthat he knew of anyhow, and that seemed to fit him down to the\r\nground--had fixed his pitch just outside, between our door and the\r\nmusic hall at the corner; and sometimes, when I might happen to\r\nhave a bit on, I\'d get a paper from him, and pay him for it, when\r\nthe governor was not about, with a mug of coffee, and odds\r\nand ends that the other customers had left on their plates--an\r\narrangement that suited both of us. He was just about as sharp as\r\nthey make boys, even in the Mile End Road, which is saying a good\r\ndeal; and now and then, spying around among the right sort, and\r\nkeeping his ears open, he would put me up to a good thing, and I\r\nwould tip him a bob or a tanner as the case might be. He was the\r\nsort that gets on--you know.\r\n\r\nOne day in he walks, for all the world as if the show belonged to\r\nhim, with a young imp of a girl on his arm, and down they sits at\r\none of the tables.\r\n\r\n"Garsong," he calls out, "what\'s the menoo to-day?"\r\n\r\n"The menoo to-day," I says, "is that you get outside \'fore I clip\r\nyou over the ear, and that you take that back and put it where you\r\nfound it;" meaning o\' course, the kid.\r\n\r\nShe was a pretty little thing, even then, in spite of the dirt,\r\nwith those eyes like saucers, and red hair. It used to be called\r\n"carrots" in those days. Now all the swells have taken it up--or\r\nas near as they can get to it--and it\'s auburn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0006]\r\n\r\n"\'Enery," he replied to me, without so much as turning a hair,\r\n"I\'m afraid you\'re forgetting your position. When I\'m on the kerb\r\nshouting \'Speshul!\' and you comes to me with yer \'a\'penny in yer\r\n\'and, you\'re master an\' I\'m man. When I comes into your shop to\r\norder refreshments, and to pay for \'em, I\'m boss. Savey? You\r\ncan bring me a rasher and two eggs, and see that they\'re this\r\nseason\'s. The lidy will have a full-sized haddick and a cocoa."\r\n\r\nWell, there was justice in what he said. He always did have sense,\r\nand I took his order. You don\'t often see anybody put it away like\r\nthat girl did. I took it she hadn\'t had a square meal for many a\r\nlong day. She polished off a ninepenny haddick, skin and all, and\r\nafter that she had two penny rashers, with six slices of bread and\r\nbutter--"doorsteps," as we used to call them--and two half pints\r\nof cocoa, which is a meal in itself the way we used to make it.\r\n"Kipper" must have had a bit of luck that day. He couldn\'t have\r\nurged her on more had it been a free feed.\r\n\r\n"\'Ave an egg," he suggested, the moment the rashers had\r\ndisappeared. "One of these eggs will just about finish yer."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t really think as I can," says she, after considering like.\r\n\r\n"Well, you know your own strength," he answers. "Perhaps you\'re\r\nbest without it. Speshully if yer not used to \'igh living."\r\n\r\nI was glad to see them finish, \'cause I was beginning to get a bit\r\nnervous about the coin, but he paid up right enough, and giv me a\r\nha\'penny for myself.\r\n\r\nThat was the first time I ever waited upon those two, but it\r\nwasn\'t to be the last by many a long chalk, as you\'ll see. He\r\noften used to bring her in after that. Who she was and what she\r\nwas he didn\'t know, and she didn\'t know, so there was a pair of\r\nthem. She\'d run away from an old woman down Limehouse way, who\r\nused to beat her. That was all she could tell him. He got her\r\na lodging with an old woman, who had an attic in the same house\r\nwhere he slept--when it would run to that--taught her to yell\r\n"Speshul!" and found a corner for her. There ain\'t room for boys\r\nand girls in the Mile-End Road. They\'re either kids down there or\r\nthey\'re grown-ups. "Kipper" and "Carrots"--as we named her--looked\r\nupon themselves as sweethearts, though he couldn\'t have been more\r\nthan fifteen, and she barely twelve; and that he was regular gone\r\non her anyone could see with half an eye. Not that he was soft\r\nabout it--that wasn\'t his style. He kept her in order, and she had\r\njust to mind, which I guess was a good thing for her, and when she\r\nwanted it he\'d use his hand on her, and make no bones about it.\r\nThat\'s the way among that class. They up and give the old woman\r\na friendly clump, just as you or me would swear at the missus, or\r\nfling a boot-jack at her. They don\'t mean anything more.\r\n\r\nI left the coffee shop later on for a place in the city, and\r\nsaw nothing more of them for five years. When I did it was at a\r\nrestaurant in Oxford Street--one of those amatoor shows run by a\r\nlot of women, who know nothing about the business, and spend the\r\nwhole day gossiping and flirting--"love-shops," I call \'em. There\r\nwas a yellow-haired lady manageress who never heard you when you\r\nspoke to her, \'cause she was always trying to hear what some seedy\r\nold fool would be whispering to her across the counter. Then there\r\nwere waitresses, and their notion of waiting was to spend an\r\nhour talking to a twopenny cup of coffee, and to look haughty and\r\ninsulted whenever anybody as really wanted something ventured to\r\nask for it. A frizzle-haired cashier used to make love all day out\r\nof her pigeon-hole with the two box-office boys from the Oxford\r\nMusic Hall, who took it turn and turn about. Sometimes she\'d leave\r\noff to take a customer\'s money, and sometimes she wouldn\'t. I\'ve\r\nbeen to some rummy places in my time; and a waiter ain\'t the blind\r\nowl as he\'s supposed to be. But never in my life have I seen so\r\nmuch love-making, not all at once, as used to go on in that place.\r\nIt was a dismal, gloomy sort of hole, and spoony couples seemed to\r\nscent it out by instinct, and would spend hours there over a\r\npot of tea and assorted pastry. "Idyllic," some folks would have\r\nthought it: I used to get the fair dismals watching it. There was\r\none girl--a weird-looking creature, with red eyes and long thin\r\nhands, that gave you the creeps to look at. She\'d come in regular\r\nwith her young man, a pale-faced nervous sort of chap, at three\r\no\'clock every afternoon. Theirs was the funniest love-making I\r\never saw. She\'d pinch him under the table, and run pins into\r\nhim, and he\'d sit with his eyes glued on her as if she\'d been a\r\nsteaming dish of steak and onions and he a starving beggar the\r\nother side of the window. A strange story that was--as I came to\r\nlearn it later on. I\'ll tell you that, one day.\r\n\r\nI\'d been engaged for the "heavy work," but as the heaviest order I\r\never heard given there was for a cold ham and chicken, which I had\r\nto slip out for to the nearest cook-shop, I must have been chiefly\r\nuseful from an ornamental point of view.\r\n\r\nI\'d been there about a fortnight, and was feeling pretty sick of\r\nit, when in walked young "Kipper." I didn\'t know him at first,\r\nhe\'d changed so. He was swinging a silver-mounted crutch stick,\r\nwhich was the kind that was fashionable just then, and was dressed\r\nin a showy check suit and a white hat. But the thing that struck\r\nme most was his gloves. I suppose I hadn\'t improved quite so much\r\nmyself, for he knew me in a moment, and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n"What, \'Enery!" he says, "you\'ve moved on, then!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I says, shaking hands with him, "and I could move on again\r\nfrom this shop without feeling sad. But you\'ve got on a bit?" I\r\nsays.\r\n\r\n"So-so," he says, "I\'m a journalist."\r\n\r\n"Oh," I says, "what sort?" for I\'d seen a good many of that lot\r\nduring six months I\'d spent at a house in Fleet Street, and their\r\nget-up hadn\'t sumptuousness about it, so to speak. "Kipper\'s"\r\nrig-out must have totted up to a tidy little sum. He had a diamond\r\npin in his tie that must have cost somebody fifty quid, if not\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Well," he answers, "I don\'t wind out the confidential advice to\r\nold Beaky, and that sort of thing. I do the tips, yer know. \'Cap\'n\r\nKit,\' that\'s my name."\r\n\r\n"What, the Captain Kit?" I says. O\' course I\'d heard of him.\r\n\r\n"Be\'old!" he says.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s easy enough," he goes on. "Some of \'em\'s bound to come\r\nout right, and when one does, you take it from me, our paper\r\nmentions the fact. And when it is a wrong \'un--well, a man can\'t\r\nalways be shouting about himself, can \'e?"\r\n\r\nHe ordered a cup of coffee. He said he was waiting for someone,\r\nand we got to chatting about old times.\r\n\r\n"How\'s Carrots?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Miss Caroline Trevelyan," he answered, "is doing well."\r\n\r\n"Oh," I says, "you\'ve found out her fam\'ly name, then?"\r\n\r\n"We\'ve found out one or two things about that lidy," he replies.\r\n"D\'yer remember \'er dancing?"\r\n\r\n"I have seen her flinging her petticoats about outside the shop,\r\nwhen the copper wasn\'t by, if that\'s what you mean," I says.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I mean," he answers. "That\'s all the rage now,\r\n\'skirt-dancing\' they calls it. She\'s a-coming out at the Oxford\r\nto-morrow. It\'s \'er I\'m waiting for. She\'s a-coming on, I tell you\r\nshe is," he says.\r\n\r\n"Shouldn\'t wonder," says I; "that was her disposition."\r\n\r\n"And there\'s another thing we\'ve found out about \'er," he says. He\r\nleant over the table, and whispered it, as if he was afraid that\r\nanybody else might hear: "she\'s got a voice."\r\n\r\n"Yes," I says, "some women have."\r\n\r\n"Ah," he says, "but \'er voice is the sort of voice yer want to\r\nlisten to."\r\n\r\n"Oh," I says, "that\'s its speciality, is it?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, sonny," he replies.\r\n\r\nShe came in a little later. I\'d a\' known her anywhere for her\r\neyes, and her red hair, in spite of her being that clean you might\r\nhave eaten your dinner out of her hand. And as for her clothes!\r\nWell, I\'ve mixed a good deal with the toffs in my time, and I\'ve\r\nseen duchesses dressed more showily and maybe more expensively,\r\nbut her clothes seemed to be just a framework to show her up. She\r\nwas a beauty, you can take it from me; and it\'s not to be wondered\r\nthat the La-De-Das were round her when they did see her, like\r\nflies round an open jam tart.\r\n\r\nBefore three months were up she was the rage of London--leastways\r\nof the music-hall part of it--with her portrait in all the shop\r\nwindows, and interviews with her in half the newspapers. It seems\r\nshe was the daughter of an officer who had died in India when she\r\nwas a baby, and the niece of a bishop somewhere in Australia.\r\nHe was dead too. There didn\'t seem to be any of her ancestry as\r\nwasn\'t dead, but they had all been swells. She had been educated\r\nprivately, she had, by a relative; and had early displayed an\r\naptitude for dancing, though her friends at first had much opposed\r\nher going upon the stage. There was a lot more of it--you know the\r\nsort of thing. Of course, she was a connection of one of our\r\nbest known judges--they all are--and she merely acted in order\r\nto support a grandmother, or an invalid sister, I forget which. A\r\nwonderful talent for swallowing, these newspaper chaps has, some\r\nof \'em!\r\n\r\n"Kipper" never touched a penny of her money, but if he had been\r\nher agent at twenty-five per cent. he couldn\'t have worked harder,\r\nand he just kept up the hum about her, till if you didn\'t want\r\nto hear anything more about Caroline Trevelyan, your only chance\r\nwould have been to lie in bed, and never look at a newspaper. It\r\nwas Caroline Trevelyan at Home, Caroline Trevelyan at Brighton,\r\nCaroline Trevelyan and the Shah of Persia, Caroline Trevelyan and\r\nthe Old Apple-woman. When it wasn\'t Caroline Trevelyan herself it\r\nwould be Caroline Trevelyan\'s dog as would be doing something out\r\nof the common, getting himself lost or summoned or drowned--it\r\ndidn\'t matter much what.\r\n\r\nI moved from Oxford Street to the new "Horseshoe" that year--it\r\nhad just been rebuilt--and there I saw a good deal of them,\r\nfor they came in to lunch there or supper pretty regular. Young\r\n"Kipper"--or the "Captain" as everybody called him--gave out that\r\nhe was her half-brother.\r\n\r\n"I\'ad to be some sort of a relation, you see," he explained to\r\nme. "I\'d a\' been \'er brother out and out; that would have been\r\nsimpler, only the family likeness wasn\'t strong enough. Our styles\r\no\' beauty ain\'t similar." They certainly wasn\'t.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you marry her?" I says, "and have done with it?"\r\n\r\nHe looked thoughtful at that. "I did think of it," he says, "and\r\nI know, jolly well, that if I \'ad suggested it \'fore she\'d found\r\nherself, she\'d have agreed, but it don\'t seem quite fair now."\r\n\r\n"How d\'ye mean fair?" I says.\r\n\r\n"Well, not fair to \'er," he says. "I\'ve got on all right, in a\r\nsmall way; but she--well, she can just \'ave \'er pick of the nobs.\r\nThere\'s one on \'em as I\'ve made inquiries about. \'E\'ll be a dock,\r\nif a kid pegs out as is expected to, and anyhow \'e\'ll be a markis,\r\nand \'e means the straight thing--no errer. It ain\'t fair for me to\r\nstand in \'er way."\r\n\r\n"Well," I says, "you know your own business, but it seems to me\r\nshe wouldn\'t have much way to stand in if it hadn\'t been for you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s all right," he says. "I\'m fond enough of the gell, but\r\nI shan\'t clamour for a tombstone with wiolets, even if she ain\'t\r\never Mrs. Capt\'n Kit. Business is business; and I ain\'t going to\r\nqueer \'er pitch for \'er."\r\n\r\nI\'ve often wondered what she\'d a\' said, if he\'d up and put the\r\ncase to her plain, for she was a good sort; but, naturally enough,\r\nher head was a bit swelled, and she\'d read so much rot about\r\nherself in the papers that she\'d got at last to half believe some\r\nof it. The thought of her connection with the well-known judge\r\nseemed to hamper her at times, and she wasn\'t quite so chummy with\r\n"Kipper" as used to be the case in the Mile-End Road days, and he\r\nwasn\'t the sort as is slow to see a thing.\r\n\r\nOne day when he was having lunch by himself, and I was waiting on\r\nhim, he says, raising his glass to his lips, "Well, \'Enery, here\'s\r\nluck to yer! I won\'t be seeing you agen for some time."\r\n\r\n"Oh," I says. "What\'s up now?"\r\n\r\n"I am," he says, "or rather my time is. I\'m off to Africa."\r\n\r\n"Oh," I says, "and what about--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," he interrupts. "I\'ve fixed up that--a treat.\r\nTruth, that\'s why I\'m going."\r\n\r\nI thought at first he meant she was going with him.\r\n\r\n"No," he says, "she\'s going to be the Duchess of Ridingshire with\r\nthe kind consent o\' the kid I spoke about. If not, she\'ll be the\r\nMarchioness of Appleford. \'E\'s doing the square thing. There\'s\r\ngoing to be a quiet marriage to-morrow at the Registry Office, and\r\nthen I\'m off."\r\n\r\n"What need for you to go?" I says.\r\n\r\n"No need," he says; "it\'s a fancy o\' mine. You see, me gone,\r\nthere\'s nothing to \'amper \'er--nothing to interfere with \'er\r\nsettling down as a quiet, respectable toff. With a \'alf-brother,\r\nwho\'s always got to be spry with some fake about \'is lineage and\r\n\'is ancestral estates, and who drops \'is \'h\'s,\' complications\r\nare sooner or later bound to a-rise. Me out of it--everything\'s\r\nsimple. Savey?"\r\n\r\nWell, that\'s just how it happened. Of course, there was a big row\r\nwhen the family heard of it, and a smart lawyer was put up to try\r\nand undo the thing. No expense was spared, you bet; but it was all\r\nno go. Nothing could be found out against her. She just sat tight\r\nand said nothing. So the thing had to stand. They went and lived\r\nquietly in the country and abroad for a year or two, and then\r\nfolks forgot a bit, and they came back to London. I often used to\r\nsee her name in print, and then the papers always said as how she\r\nwas charming and graceful and beautiful, so I suppose the family\r\nhad made up its mind to get used to her.\r\n\r\nOne evening in she comes to the Savoy. My wife put me up to\r\ngetting that job, and a good job it is, mind you, when you know\r\nyour way about. I\'d never have had the cheek to try for it, if it\r\nhadn\'t been for the missis. She\'s a clever one--she is. I did a\r\ngood day\'s work when I married her.\r\n\r\n"You shave off that moustache of yours--it ain\'t an ornament," she\r\nsays to me, "and chance it. Don\'t get attempting the lingo. Keep\r\nto the broken English, and put in a shrug or two. You can manage\r\nthat all right."\r\n\r\nI followed her tip. Of course the manager saw through me, but\r\nI got in a "Oui, monsieur" now and again, and they, being short\r\nhanded at the time, could not afford to be strict, I suppose.\r\nAnyhow I got took on, and there I stopped for the whole season,\r\nand that was the making of me.\r\n\r\nWell, as I was saying, in she comes to the supper rooms, and toffy\r\nenough she looked in her diamonds and furs, and as for haughtiness\r\nthere wasn\'t a born Marchioness she couldn\'t have given points to.\r\nShe comes straight up to my table and sits down. Her husband was\r\nwith her, but he didn\'t seem to have much to say, except to repeat\r\nher orders. Of course I looked as if I\'d never set eyes on her\r\nbefore in all my life, though all the time she was a-pecking at\r\nthe mayonnaise and a-sipping at the Giessler, I was thinking\r\nof the coffee-shop and of the ninepenny haddick and the pint of\r\ncocoa.\r\n\r\n"Go and fetch my cloak," she says to him after a while. "I am\r\ncold."\r\n\r\nAnd up he gets and goes out.\r\n\r\nShe never moved her head, and spoke as though she was merely\r\ngiving me some order, and I stands behind her chair, respectful\r\nlike, and answers according to the same tip.\r\n\r\n"Ever hear from \'Kipper\'?" she says to me.\r\n\r\n"I have had one or two letters from him, your ladyship," I\r\nanswers.\r\n\r\n"Oh, stow that," she says. "I am sick of \'your ladyship.\' Talk\r\nEnglish; I don\'t hear much of it. How\'s he getting on?"\r\n\r\n"Seems to be doing himself well," I says. "He\'s started an hotel,\r\nand is regular raking it in, he tells me."\r\n\r\n"Wish I was behind the bar with him!" says she.\r\n\r\n"Why, don\'t it work then?" I asks.\r\n\r\n"It\'s just like a funeral with the corpse left out," says she.\r\n"Serves me jolly well right for being a fool!"\r\n\r\nThe Marquis, he comes back with her cloak at that moment, and I\r\nsays: "Certainement, madame," and gets clear.\r\n\r\nI often used to see her there, and when a chance occurred she\r\nwould talk to me. It seemed to be a relief to her to use her own\r\ntongue, but it made me nervous at times for fear someone would\r\nhear her.\r\n\r\nThen one day I got a letter from "Kipper" to say he was over for\r\na holiday and was stopping at Morley\'s, and asking me to look him\r\nup.\r\n\r\nHe had not changed much except to get a bit fatter and more\r\nprosperous-looking. Of course, we talked about her ladyship, and I\r\ntold him what she said.\r\n\r\n"Rum things, women," he says; "never know their own minds."\r\n\r\n"Oh, they know them all right when they get there," I says. "How\r\ncould she tell what being a Marchioness was like till she\'d tried\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Pity," he says, musing like. "I reckoned it the very thing she\'d\r\ntumble to. I only come over to get a sight of \'er, and to satisfy\r\nmyself as she was getting along all right. Seems I\'d better a\'\r\nstopped away."\r\n\r\n"You ain\'t ever thought of marrying yourself?" I asks.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have," he says. "It\'s slow for a man over thirty with no\r\nwife and kids to bustle him, you take it from me, and I ain\'t the\r\ntalent for the Don Juan fake."\r\n\r\n"You\'re like me," I says, "a day\'s work, and then a pipe by your\r\nown fireside with your slippers on. That\'s my swarry. You\'ll find\r\nsomeone as will suit you before long."\r\n\r\n"No I shan\'t," says he. "I\'ve come across a few as might, if it\r\n\'adn\'t been for \'er. It\'s like the toffs as come out our way.\r\nThey\'ve been brought up on \'ris de veau a la financier,\' and sich\r\nlike, and it just spoils \'em for the bacon and greens."\r\n\r\nI give her the office the next time I see her, and they met\r\naccidental like in Kensington Gardens early one morning. What they\r\nsaid to one another I don\'t know, for he sailed that same evening,\r\nand, it being the end of the season, I didn\'t see her ladyship\r\nagain for a long while.\r\n\r\nWhen I did it was at the Hotel Bristol in Paris, and she was in\r\nwidow\'s weeds, the Marquis having died eight months before. He\r\nnever dropped into that dukedom, the kid turning out healthier\r\nthan was expected, and hanging on; so she was still only a\r\nMarchioness, and her fortune, though tidy, was nothing very\r\nbig--not as that class reckons. By luck I was told to wait on her,\r\nshe having asked for someone as could speak English. She seemed\r\nglad to see me and to talk to me.\r\n\r\n"Well," I says, "I suppose you\'ll be bossing that bar in Capetown\r\nnow before long?"\r\n\r\n"Talk sense," she answers. "How can the Marchioness of Appleford\r\nmarry a hotel keeper?"\r\n\r\n"Why not," I says, "if she fancies him? What\'s the good of being a\r\nMarchioness if you can\'t do what you like?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it," she snaps out; "you can\'t. It would not be doing\r\nthe straight thing by the family. No," she says, "I\'ve spent\r\ntheir money, and I\'m spending it now. They don\'t love me, but they\r\nshan\'t say as I have disgraced them. They\'ve got their feelings\r\nsame as I\'ve got mine."\r\n\r\n"Why not chuck the money?" I says. "They\'ll be glad enough to get\r\nit back," they being a poor lot, as I heard her say.\r\n\r\n"How can I?" she says. "It\'s a life interest. As long as I live\r\nI\'ve got to have it, and as long as I live I\'ve got to remain the\r\nMarchioness of Appleford."\r\n\r\nShe finishes her soup, and pushes the plate away from her. "As\r\nlong as I live," she says, talking to herself.\r\n\r\n"By Jove!" she says, starting up "why not?"\r\n\r\n"Why not what?" I says.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," she answers. "Get me an African telegraph form, and be\r\nquick about it!"\r\n\r\nI fetched it for her, and she wrote it and gave it to the porter\r\nthen and there; and, that done, she sat down and finished her\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nShe was a bit short with me after that; so I judged it best to\r\nkeep my own place.\r\n\r\nIn the morning she got an answer that seemed to excite her,\r\nand that afternoon she left; and the next I heard of her was a\r\nparagraph in the newspaper, headed--"Death of the Marchioness of\r\nAppleford. Sad accident." It seemed she had gone for a row on one\r\nof the Italian lakes with no one but a boatman. A squall had come\r\non, and the boat had capsized. The boatman had swum ashore, but he\r\nhad been unable to save his passenger, and her body had never been\r\nrecovered. The paper reminded its readers that she had formerly\r\nbeen the celebrated tragic actress, Caroline Trevelyan, daughter\r\nof the well-known Indian judge of that name.\r\n\r\nIt gave me the blues for a day or two--that bit of news. I had\r\nknown her from a baby as you might say, and had taken an interest\r\nin her. You can call it silly, but hotels and restaurants seemed\r\nto me less interesting now there was no chance of ever seeing her\r\ncome into one again.\r\n\r\nI went from Paris to one of the smaller hotels in Venice. The\r\nmissis thought I\'d do well to pick up a bit of Italian, and\r\nperhaps she fancied Venice for herself. That\'s one of the\r\nadvantages of our profession. You can go about. It was a\r\nsecond-rate sort of place, and one evening, just before\r\nlighting-up time, I had the salle-a-manger all to myself, and\r\nhad just taken up a paper when I hears the door open, and I turns\r\nround.\r\n\r\nI saw "her" coming down the room. There was no mistaking her. She\r\nwasn\'t that sort.\r\n\r\nI sat with my eyes coming out of my head till she was close to me,\r\nand then I says:\r\n\r\n"Carrots!" I says, in a whisper like. That was the name that come\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n"\'Carrots\' it is," she says, and down she sits just opposite to\r\nme, and then she laughs.\r\n\r\nI could not speak, I could not move, I was that took aback, and\r\nthe more frightened I looked the more she laughed till "Kipper"\r\ncomes into the room. There was nothing ghostly about him. I never\r\nsee a man look more as if he had backed the winner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0047]\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s \'Enery," he says; and he gives me a slap on the back,\r\nas knocks the life into me again.\r\n\r\n"I heard you was dead," I says, still staring at her. "I read it\r\nin the paper--\'death of the Marchioness of Appleford.\'"\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," she says. "The Marchioness of Appleford is\r\nas dead as a door-nail, and a good job too. Mrs. Captain Kit\'s my\r\nname, nee \'Carrots.\'"\r\n\r\n"You said as \'ow I\'d find someone to suit me \'fore long," says\r\n"Kipper" to me, "and, by Jove! you were right; I \'ave. I was\r\nwaiting till I found something equal to her ladyship, and I\'d \'ave\r\n\'ad to wait a long time, I\'m thinking, if I \'adn\'t come across\r\nthis one \'ere"; and he tucks her up under his arm just as\r\nI remember his doing that day he first brought her into the\r\ncoffee-shop, and Lord, what a long time ago that was!\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThat is the story, among others, told me by Henry, the waiter. I\r\nhave, at his request, substituted artificial names for real ones.\r\nFor Henry tells me that at Capetown Captain Kit\'s First-class\r\nFamily and Commercial Hotel still runs, and that the landlady is\r\nstill a beautiful woman with fine eyes and red hair, who might\r\nalmost be taken for a duchess--until she opens her mouth, when her\r\naccent is found to be still slightly reminiscent of the Mile-End\r\nRoad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USES AND ABUSES OF JOSEPH\r\n\r\n\r\n|It is just the same with what you may call the human joints,"\r\nobserved Henry. He was in one of his philosophic moods that\r\nevening. "It all depends upon the cooking. I never see a youngster\r\nhanging up in the refrigerator, as one may put it, but I says to\r\nmyself: \'Now I wonder what the cook is going to make of you! Will\r\nyou be minced and devilled and fricasseed till you are all sauce\r\nand no meat? Will you be hammered tender and grilled over a slow\r\nfire till you are a blessing to mankind? Or will you be spoilt in\r\nthe boiling, and come out a stringy rag, an immediate curse, and a\r\npermanent injury to those who have got to swallow you?\'\r\n\r\n"There was a youngster I knew in my old coffee-shop days,"\r\ncontinued Henry, "that in the end came to be eaten by cannibals.\r\nAt least, so the newspapers said. Speaking for myself, I never\r\nbelieved the report: he wasn\'t that sort. If anybody was eaten, it\r\nwas more likely the cannibal. But that is neither here nor there.\r\nWhat I am thinking of is what happened before he and the cannibals\r\never got nigh to one another. He was fourteen when I first set\r\neyes on him--Mile End fourteen, that is; which is the same, I\r\ntake it, as City eighteen and West End five-and-twenty--and he was\r\nsmart for his age into the bargain: a trifle too smart as a matter\r\nof fact. He always came into the shop at the same time--half-past\r\ntwo; he always sat in the seat next the window; and three days\r\nout of six, he would order the same dinner: a fourpenny beef-steak\r\npudding--we called it beef-steak, and, for all practical purposes,\r\nit was beef-steak--a penny plate of potatoes, and a penny slice\r\nof roly-poly pudding--\'chest expander\' was the name our customers\r\ngave it--to follow. That showed sense, I always thought, that\r\ndinner alone; a more satisfying menu, at the price, I defy any\r\nhuman being to work out. He always had a book with him, and he\r\ngenerally read during his meal; which is not a bad plan if you\r\ndon\'t want to think too much about what you are eating. There was\r\na seedy chap, I remember, used to dine at a cheap restaurant where\r\nI once served, just off the Euston Road. He would stick a book up\r\nin front of him--Eppy something or other--and read the whole time.\r\nOur four-course shilling table d\'hote with Eppy, he would say, was\r\na banquet fit for a prince; without Eppy he was of opinion that\r\na policeman wouldn\'t touch it. But he was one of those men that\r\nreport things for the newspapers, and was given to exaggeration.\r\n\r\n"A coffee-shop becomes a bit of a desert towards three o\'clock;\r\nand, after a while, young Tidelman, for that was his name, got\r\nto putting down his book and chatting to me. His father was dead;\r\nwhich, judging from what he told me about the old man, must have\r\nbeen a bit of luck for everybody; and his mother, it turned out,\r\nhad come from my own village in Suffolk; and that constituted a\r\nsort of bond between us, seeing I had known all her people pretty\r\nintimately. He was earning good money at a dairy, where his work\r\nwas scouring milk-cans; and his Christian name--which was the only\r\nthing Christian about him, and that, somehow or another, didn\'t\r\nseem to fit him--was Joseph.\r\n\r\n"One afternoon he came into the shop looking as if he had lost\r\na shilling and found sixpence, as the saying is; and instead of\r\ndrinking water as usual, sent the girl out for a pint of ale. The\r\nmoment it came he drank off half of it at a gulp, and then sat\r\nstaring out of the window.\r\n\r\n"\'What\'s up?\' I says. \'Got the shove?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes,\' he answers; \'but, as it happens, it\'s a shove up. I\'ve\r\nbeen taken off the yard and put on the walk, with a rise of two\r\nbob a week.\' Then he took another pull at the beer and looked more\r\nsavage than ever.\r\n\r\n"\'Well,\' I says, \'that ain\'t the sort of thing to be humpy about.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes it is,\' he snaps back; \'it means that if I don\'t take\r\nprecious good care I\'ll drift into being a blooming milkman,\r\nspending my life yelling "Milk ahoi!" and spooning smutty-faced\r\nservant-gals across area railings.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Oh!\' I says, \'and what may you prefer to spoon--duchesses?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes,\' he answers sulky-like; \'duchesses are right enough--some\r\nof \'em.\'\r\n\r\n"\'So are servant-gals,\' I says, \'some of \'em. Your hat\'s feeling a\r\nbit small for you this morning, ain\'t it?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Hat\'s all right,\' says he; \'it\'s the world as I\'m complaining\r\nof--beastly place; there\'s nothing to do in it.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Oh!\' I says; \'some of us find there\'s a bit too much.\' I\'d been\r\nup since five that morning myself; and his own work, which was\r\nscouring milk-cans for twelve hours a day, didn\'t strike me as\r\nsuggesting a life of leisured ease.\r\n\r\n"\'I don\'t mean that,\' he says. \'I mean things worth doing.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Well, what do you want to do,\' I says, \'that this world ain\'t\r\nbig enough for?\'\r\n\r\n"\'It ain\'t the size of it,\' he says; \'it\'s the dulness of it.\r\nThings used to be different in the old days.\'\r\n\r\n"\'How do you know?\' I says.\r\n\r\n"\'You can read about it,\' he answers.\r\n\r\n"\'Oh,\' I says, \'and what do they know about it--these gents that\r\nsit down and write about it for their living! You show me a book\r\ncracking up the old times, writ by a chap as lived in \'em, and\r\nI\'ll believe you. Till then I\'ll stick to my opinion that the old\r\ndays were much the same as these days, and maybe a trifle worse.\'\r\n\r\n"\'From a Sunday School point of view, perhaps yes,\' says he; \'but\r\nthere\'s no gainsaying--\'\r\n\r\n"\'No what?\' I says.\r\n\r\n"\'No gainsaying,\' repeats he; \'it\'s a common word in literatoor.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Maybe,\' says I, \'but this happens to be "The Blue Posts Coffee\r\nHouse," established in the year 1863. We will use modern English\r\nhere, if you don\'t mind.\' One had to take him down like that at\r\ntimes. He was the sort of boy as would talk poetry to you if you\r\nweren\'t firm with him.\r\n\r\n"\'Well then, there\'s no denying the fact,\' says he, \'if you prefer\r\nit that way, that in the old days there was more opportunity for\r\nadventure.\'\r\n\r\n"\'What about Australia?\' says I.\r\n\r\n"\'Australia!\' retorts he; \'what would I do there? Be a shepherd,\r\nlike you see in the picture, wear ribbons, and play the flute?\'\r\n\r\n"\'There\'s not much of that sort of shepherding over there,\' says\r\nI, \'unless I\'ve been deceived; but if Australia ain\'t sufficiently\r\nuncivilised for you, what about Africa?\'\r\n\r\n"\'What\'s the good of Africa?\' replies he; \'you don\'t read\r\nadvertisements in the "Clerkenwell News": "Young men wanted as\r\nexplorers." I\'d drift into a barber\'s shop at Cape Town more\r\nlikely than anything else.\'\r\n\r\n"\'What about the gold diggings?\' I suggests. I like to see a\r\nyoungster with the spirit of adventure in him. It shows grit as a\r\nrule.\r\n\r\n"\'Played out,\' says he. \'You are employed by a company, wages\r\nten dollars a week, and a pension for your old age. Everything\'s\r\nplayed out,\' he continues. \'Men ain\'t wanted nowadays. There\'s\r\nonly room for clerks, and intelligent artisans, and shopboys.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Go for a soldier,\' says I; \'there\'s excitement for you.\'\r\n\r\n"\'That would have been all right,\' says he, \'in the days when\r\nthere was real fighting.\'\r\n\r\n"\'There\'s a good bit of it going about nowadays,\' I says. \'We are\r\ngenerally at it, on and off, between shouting about the blessings\r\nof peace.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Not the sort of fighting I mean,\' replies he; \'I want to do\r\nsomething myself, not be one of a row.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Well,\' I says, \'I give you up. You\'ve dropped into the wrong\r\nworld it seems to me. We don\'t seem able to cater for you here.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I\'ve come a bit too late,\' he answers; \'that\'s the mistake I\'ve\r\nmade. Two hundred years ago there were lots of things a fellow\r\nmight have done.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, I know what\'s in your mind,\' I says: \'pirates.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, pirates would be all right,\' says he; \'they got plenty of\r\nsea-air and exercise, and didn\'t need to join a blooming funeral\r\nclub.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You\'ve got ideas above your station,\' I says. \'You work hard,\r\nand one day you\'ll have a milk-shop of your own, and be walking\r\nout with a pretty housemaid on your arm, feeling as if you were\r\nthe Prince of Wales himself.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Stow it!\' he says; \'it makes me shiver for fear it might come\r\ntrue. I\'m not cut out for a respectable cove, and I won\'t be one\r\nneither, if I can help it!\'\r\n\r\n"\'What do you mean to be, then?\' I says; \'we\'ve all got to be\r\nsomething, until we\'re stiff \'uns.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Well,\' he says, quite cool-like, \'I think I shall be a burglar.\'\r\n\r\n"I dropped into the seat opposite and stared at him. If any other\r\nlad had said it I should have known it was only foolishness, but\r\nhe was just the sort to mean it.\r\n\r\n"\'It\'s the only calling I can think of,\' says he, \'that has got\r\nany element of excitement left in it.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You call seven years at Portland "excitement," do you?\' says I,\r\nthinking of the argument most likely to tell upon him.\r\n\r\n"\'What\'s the difference,\' answers he, \'between Portland and the\r\nordinary labouring man\'s life, except that at Portland you\r\nnever need fear being out of work?\' He was a rare one to argue.\r\n\'Besides,\' says he, \'it\'s only the fools as gets copped. Look at\r\nthat diamond robbery in Bond Street, two years ago. Fifty thousand\r\npounds\' worth of jewels stolen, and never a clue to this day! Look\r\nat the Dublin Bank robbery,\' says he, his eyes all alight, and\r\nhis face flushed like a girl\'s. \'Three thousand pounds in golden\r\nsovereigns walked away with in broad daylight, and never so much\r\nas the flick of a coat-tail seen. Those are the sort of men I\'m\r\nthinking of, not the bricklayer out of work, who smashes a window\r\nand gets ten years for breaking open a cheesemonger\'s till with\r\nnine and fourpence ha\'penny in it.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes,\' says I, \'and are you forgetting the chap who was nabbed at\r\nBirmingham only last week? He wasn\'t exactly an amatoor. How long\r\ndo think he\'ll get?\'\r\n\r\n"\'A man like that deserves what he gets,\' answers he; \'couldn\'t\r\nhit a police-man at six yards.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You bloodthirsty young scoundrel,\' I says; \'do you mean you\r\nwouldn\'t stick at murder?\'\r\n\r\n"\'It\'s all in the game,\' says he, not in the least put out. \'I\r\ntake my risks, he takes his. It\'s no more murder than soldiering\r\nis.\'\r\n\r\n"\'It\'s taking a human creature\'s life,\' I says.\r\n\r\n"\'Well,\' he says, \'what of it? There\'s plenty more where he comes\r\nfrom.\'\r\n\r\n"I tried reasoning with him from time to time, but he wasn\'t a\r\nsort of boy to be moved from a purpose. His mother was the only\r\nargument that had any weight with him. I believe so long as she\r\nhad lived he would have kept straight; that was the only soft spot\r\nin him. But unfortunately she died a couple of years later, and\r\nthen I lost sight of Joe altogether. I made enquiries, but no one\r\ncould tell me anything. He had just disappeared, that\'s all.\r\n\r\n"One afternoon, four years later, I was sitting in the coffee-room\r\nof a City restaurant where I was working, reading the account of a\r\nclever robbery committed the day before. The thief, described as a\r\nwell-dressed young man of gentlemanly appearance, wearing a short\r\nblack beard and moustache, had walked into a branch of the London\r\nand Westminster Bank during the dinner-hour, when only the manager\r\nand one clerk were there. He had gone straight through to the\r\nmanager\'s room at the back of the bank, taken the key from the\r\ninside of the door, and before the man could get round his desk\r\nhad locked him in. The clerk, with a knife to his throat, had then\r\nbeen persuaded to empty all the loose cash in the bank, amounting\r\nin gold and notes to nearly five hundred pounds, into a bag which\r\nthe thief had thoughtfully brought with him. After which, both\r\nof them--for the thief seems to have been of a sociable\r\ndisposition--got into a cab which was waiting outside, and drove\r\naway. They drove straight to the City: the clerk, with a knife\r\npricking the back of his neck all the time, finding it, no\r\ndoubt, a tiresome ride. In the middle of Threadneedle Street,\r\nthe gentlemanly young man suddenly stopped the cab and got out,\r\nleaving the clerk to pay the cabman.\r\n\r\n"Somehow or other, the story brought back Joseph to my mind. I\r\nseemed to see him as that well-dressed gentlemanly young man; and,\r\nraising my eyes from the paper, there he stood before me. He had\r\nscarcely changed at all since I last saw him, except that he had\r\ngrown better looking, and seemed more cheerful. He nodded to me\r\nas though we had parted the day before, and ordered a chop and a\r\nsmall hock. I spread a fresh serviette for him, and asked him if\r\nhe cared to see the paper.\r\n\r\n"\'Anything interesting in it, Henry?\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'Rather a daring robbery committed on the Westminster Bank\r\nyesterday,\' I answers.\r\n\r\n"\'Oh, ah! I did see something about that,\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'The thief was described as a well-dressed young man of\r\ngentlemanly appearance, wearing a black beard and moustache,\' says\r\nI.\r\n\r\n"He laughs pleasantly.\r\n\r\n"\'That will make it awkward for nice young men with black beards\r\nand moustaches,\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'Yes,\' I says. \'Fortunately for you and me, we\'re clean shaved.\'\r\n\r\n"I felt as certain he was the man as though I\'d seen him do it.\r\n\r\n"He gives me a sharp glance, but I was busy with the cruets, and\r\nhe had to make what he chose out of it.\r\n\r\n"\'Yes,\' he replies, \'as you say, it was a daring robbery. But the\r\nman seems to have got away all right.\'\r\n\r\n"I could see he was dying to talk to somebody about it.\r\n\r\n"\'He\'s all right to-day,\' says I; \'but the police ain\'t the fools\r\nthey\'re reckoned. I\'ve noticed they generally get there in the\r\nend.\'\r\n\r\n"\'There\'s some very intelligent men among them,\' says he: \'no\r\nquestion of it. I shouldn\'t be surprised if they had a clue!\'\r\n\r\n"\'No,\' I says, \'no more should I; though no doubt he\'s telling\r\nhimself there never was such a clever thief.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Well, we shall see,\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'That\'s about it,\' says I.\r\n\r\n"We talked a bit about old acquaintances and other things, and\r\nthen, having finished, he handed me a sovereign and rose to go.\r\n\r\n"\'Wait a minute,\' I says, \'your bill comes to three-and-eight. Say\r\nfourpence for the waiter; that leaves sixteen shillings change,\r\nwhich I\'ll ask you to put in your pocket.\'\r\n\r\n"\'As you will,\' he says, laughing, though I could see he didn\'t\r\nlike it.\r\n\r\n"\'And one other thing,\' says I. \'We\'ve been sort of pals, and it\'s\r\nnot my business to talk unless I\'m spoken to. But I\'m a married\r\nman,\' I says, \'and I don\'t consider you the sort worth getting\r\ninto trouble for. If I never see you, I know nothing about you.\r\nUnderstand?\'\r\n\r\n"He took my tip, and I didn\'t see him again at that restaurant. I\r\nkept my eye on the paper, but the Westminster Bank thief was never\r\ndiscovered, and success, no doubt, gave him confidence. Anyhow, I\r\nread of two or three burglaries that winter which I unhesitatingly\r\nput down to Mr. Joseph--I suppose there\'s style in housebreaking,\r\nas in other things--and early the next spring an exciting bit of\r\nbusiness occurred, which I knew to be his work by the description\r\nof the man.\r\n\r\n"He had broken into a big country house during the servants\'\r\nsupper-hour, and had stuffed his pockets with jewels. One of the\r\nguests, a young officer, coming upstairs, interrupted him just as\r\nhe had finished. Joseph threatened the man with his revolver; but\r\nthis time it was not a nervous young clerk he had to deal with.\r\nThe man sprang at him, and a desperate struggle followed, with the\r\nresult that in the end the officer was left with a bullet in his\r\nleg, while Joseph jumped clean through the window, and fell thirty\r\nfeet. Cut and bleeding, if not broken, he would never have got\r\naway but that, fortunately for him, a tradesman\'s cart happened to\r\nbe standing at the servants\' entrance. Joe was in it, and off like\r\na flash of greased lightning. How he managed to escape, with all\r\nthe country in an uproar, I can\'t tell you; but he did it. The\r\nhorse and cart, when found sixteen miles off, were neither worth\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n"That, it seems, sobered him down for a bit, and nobody heard\r\nany more of him till nine months later, when he walked into the\r\nMonico, where I was then working, and held out his hand to me as\r\nbold as brass.\r\n\r\n"\'It\'s all right,\' says he, \'it\'s the hand of an honest man.\'\r\n\r\n"\'It\'s come into your possession very recently then,\' says I.\r\n\r\n"He was dressed in a black frock-coat and wore whiskers. If I\r\nhadn\'t known him, I should have put him down for a parson out of\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n"He laughs. \'I\'ll tell you all about it,\' he says.\r\n\r\n"\'Not here,\' I answers, \'because I\'m too busy; but if you like to\r\nmeet me this evening, and you\'re talking straight--\'\r\n\r\n"\'Straight as a bullet,\' says he. \'Come and have a bit of dinner\r\nwith me at the Craven; it\'s quiet there, and we can talk. I\'ve\r\nbeen looking for you for the last week.\'\r\n\r\n"Well, I met him; and he told me. It was the old story: a gal\r\nwas at the bottom of it. He had broken into a small house at\r\nHampstead. He was on the floor, packing up the silver, when the\r\ndoor opens, and he sees a gal standing there. She held a candle in\r\none hand and a revolver in the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0079]\r\n\r\n"\'Put your hands up above your head,\' says she.\r\n\r\n"\'I looked at the revolver,\' said Joe, telling me; \'it was about\r\neighteen inches off my nose; and then I looked at the gal. There\'s\r\nlots of \'em will threaten to blow your brains out for you, but\r\nyou\'ve only got to look at \'em to know they won\'t.\r\n\r\n"\'They are thinking of the coroner\'s inquest, and wondering how\r\nthe judge will sum up. She met my eyes, and I held up my hands. If\r\nI hadn\'t I wouldn\'t have been here.\r\n\r\n"\'Now you go in front,\' says she to Joe, and he went. She laid her\r\ncandle down in the hall and unbolted the front door.\r\n\r\n"\'What are you going to do?\' says Joe, \'call the police? Because\r\nif so, my dear, I\'ll take my chance of that revolver being\r\nloaded and of your pulling the trigger in time. It will be a more\r\ndignified ending.\'\r\n\r\n"\'No,\' says she, \'I had a brother that got seven years for\r\nforgery. I don\'t want to think of another face like his when he\r\ncame out. I\'m going to see you outside my master\'s house, and\r\nthat\'s all I care about.\'\r\n\r\n"She went down the garden-path with him, and opened the gate.\r\n\r\n"\'You turn round,\' says she, \'before you reach the bottom of the\r\nlane and I give the alarm.\' And Joe went straight, and didn\'t look\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n"Well, it was a rum beginning to a courtship, but the end was\r\nrummer. The girl was willing to marry him if he would turn honest.\r\nJoe wanted to turn honest, but didn\'t know how.\r\n\r\n"\'It\'s no use fixing me down, my dear, to any quiet, respectable\r\ncalling,\' says Joe to the gal, \'because, even if the police would\r\nlet me alone, I wouldn\'t be able to stop there. I\'d break out,\r\nsooner or later, try as I might.\'\r\n\r\n"The girl went to her master, who seems to have been an odd sort\r\nof a cove, and told him the whole story. The old gent said he\'d\r\nsee Joe, and Joe called on him.\r\n\r\n"\'What\'s your religion?\' says the old gent to Joe.\r\n\r\n"\'I\'m not particular, sir; I\'ll leave it to you,\' says Joe.\r\n\r\n"\'Good!\' says the old gent. \'You\'re no fanatic. What are your\r\nprinciples?\'\r\n\r\n"At first Joe didn\'t think he\'d got any, but, the old gent\r\nleading, he found to his surprise as he had.\r\n\r\n"\'I believe,\' says Joe, \'in doing a job thoroughly.\'\r\n\r\n"\'What your hand finds to do, you believe in doing with all your\r\nmight, eh?\' says the old gent.\r\n\r\n"\'That\'s it, sir,\' says Joe. \'That\'s what I\'ve always tried to\r\ndo.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Anything else?\' asks the old gent.\r\n\r\n"\'Yes; stick to your pals,\' said Joe.\r\n\r\n"\'Through thick and thin,\' suggests the old gent.\r\n\r\n"\'To the blooming end,\' agrees Joe.\r\n\r\n"\'That\'s right,\' says the old gent. \'Faithful unto death. And you\r\nreally want to turn over a new leaf--to put your wits and your\r\nenergy and your courage to good use instead of bad?\'\r\n\r\n"\'That\'s the idea,\' says Joe.\r\n\r\n"The old gent murmurs something to himself about a stone which the\r\nbuilders wouldn\'t have at any price; and then he turns and puts it\r\nstraight:\r\n\r\n"\'If you undertake the work,\' says he, \'you\'ll go through with it\r\nwithout faltering--you\'ll devote your life to it?\'\r\n\r\n"\'If I undertake the job, I\'ll do that,\' says Joe. \'What may it\r\nbe?\'\r\n\r\n"\'To go to Africa,\' says the old gent, \'as a missionary.\'\r\n\r\n"Joe sits down and stares at the old gent, and the old gent looks\r\nhim back.\r\n\r\n"\'It\'s a dangerous station,\' says the old gent. \'Two of our people\r\nhave lost their lives there. It wants a man there--a man who will\r\ndo something besides preach, who will save these poor people we\r\nhave gathered together there from being scattered and lost, who\r\nwill be their champion, their protector, their friend.\'\r\n\r\n"In the end, Joe took on the job, and went out with his wife. A\r\nbetter missionary that Society never had and never wanted. I read\r\none of his early reports home; and if the others were anything\r\nlike it his life must have been exciting enough, even for him. His\r\nstation was a small island of civilisation, as one may say, in the\r\nmiddle of a sea of savages. Before he had been there a month the\r\nplace had been attacked twice. On the first occasion Joe\'s \'flock\'\r\nhad crowded into the Mission House, and commenced to pray, that\r\nhaving been the plan of defence adopted by his predecessor. Joe\r\ncut the prayer short, and preached to them from the text, \'Heaven\r\nhelps them as helps themselves\'; after which he proceeded to deal\r\nout axes and old rifles. In his report he mentioned that he had\r\ntaken a hand himself, merely as an example to the flock; I bet\r\nhe had never enjoyed an evening more in all his life. The second\r\nfight began, as usual, round the Mission, but seems to have\r\nended two miles off. In less than six months he had rebuilt the\r\nschool-house, organised a police force, converted all that was\r\nleft of one tribe, and started a tin church. He added (but I don\'t\r\nthink they read that part of his report aloud) that law and order\r\nwas going to be respected, and life and property secure in his\r\ndistrict so long as he had a bullet left.\r\n\r\n"Later on the Society sent him still further inland, to open up a\r\nfresh station; and there it was that, according to the newspapers,\r\nthe cannibals got hold of him and ate him. As I said, personally\r\nI don\'t believe it. One of these days he\'ll turn up, sound and\r\nwhole; he is that sort."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SURPRISE OF MR. MILBERRY\r\n\r\n\r\n|It\'s not the sort of thing to tell \'em," remarked Henry, as, with\r\nhis napkin over his arm, he leant against one of the pillars of\r\nthe verandah, and sipped the glass of Burgundy I had poured out\r\nfor him; "and they wouldn\'t believe it if you did tell \'em, not\r\none of \'em. But it\'s the truth, for all that. Without the clothes\r\nthey couldn\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"Who wouldn\'t believe what?" I asked. He had a curious habit, had\r\nHenry, of commenting aloud upon his own unspoken thoughts, thereby\r\nbestowing upon his conversation much of the quality of the double\r\nacrostic. We had been discussing the question whether sardines\r\nserved their purpose better as a hors d\'oeuvre or as a savoury;\r\nand I found myself wondering for the moment why sardines,\r\nabove all other fish, should be of an unbelieving nature; while\r\nendeavouring to picture to myself the costume best adapted to\r\ndisplay the somewhat difficult figure of a sardine. Henry put down\r\nhis glass, and came to my rescue with the necessary explanation.\r\n\r\n"Why, women--that they can tell one baby from another, without its\r\nclothes. I\'ve got a sister, a monthly nurse, and she will tell you\r\nfor a fact, if you care to ask her, that up to three months of age\r\nthere isn\'t really any difference between \'em. You can tell a girl\r\nfrom a boy and a Christian child from a black heathen, perhaps;\r\nbut to fancy you can put your finger on an unclothed infant and\r\nsay: \'That\'s a Smith, or that\'s a Jones,\' as the case may be--why,\r\nit\'s sheer nonsense. Take the things off \'em, and shake them up\r\nin a blanket, and I\'ll bet you what you like that which is which\r\nyou\'d never be able to tell again so long as you lived."\r\n\r\nI agreed with Henry, so far as my own personal powers of\r\ndiscrimination might be concerned, but I suggested that to\r\nMrs. Jones or Mrs. Smith there would surely occur some means of\r\nidentification.\r\n\r\n"So they\'d tell you themselves, no doubt," replied Henry; "and of\r\ncourse, I am not thinking of cases where the child might have\r\na mole or a squint, as might come in useful. But take \'em in\r\ngeneral, kids are as much alike as sardines of the same age would\r\nbe. Anyhow, I knew a case where a fool of a young nurse mixed up\r\ntwo children at an hotel, and to this day neither of those women\r\nis sure that she\'s got her own."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean," I said, "there was no possible means of\r\ndistinguishing?"\r\n\r\n"There wasn\'t a flea-bite to go by," answered Henry. "They had the\r\nsame bumps, the same pimples, the same scratches; they were the\r\nsame age to within three days; they weighed the same to an ounce;\r\nand they measured the same to an inch. One father was tall and\r\nfair, and the other was short and dark. The tall, fair man had a\r\ndark, short wife; and the short, dark man had married a tall, fair\r\nwoman. For a week they changed those kids to and fro a dozen times\r\na day, and cried and quarrelled over them. Each woman felt sure\r\nshe was the mother of the one that was crowing at the moment,\r\nand when it yelled she was positive it was no child of hers. They\r\nthought they would trust to the instinct of the children. Neither\r\nchild, so long as it wasn\'t hungry, appeared to care a curse for\r\nanybody; and when it was hungry it always wanted the mother that\r\nthe other kid had got. They decided, in the end, to leave it to\r\ntime. It\'s three years ago now, and possibly enough some likeness\r\nto the parents will develop that will settle the question. All I\r\nsay is, up to three months old you can\'t tell \'em, I don\'t care\r\nwho says you can."\r\n\r\nHe paused, and appeared to be absorbed in contemplation of the\r\ndistant Matterhorn, then clad in its rosy robe of evening. There\r\nwas a vein of poetry in Henry, not uncommon among cooks and\r\nwaiters. The perpetual atmosphere of hot food I am inclined to\r\nthink favourable to the growth of the softer emotions. One of the\r\nmost sentimental men I ever knew kept a ham-and-beef shop just off\r\nthe Farringdon Road. In the early morning he could be shrewd and\r\nbusiness-like, but when hovering with a knife and fork above the\r\nmingled steam of bubbling sausages and hissing peas-pudding, any\r\nwhimpering tramp with any impossible tale of woe could impose upon\r\nhim easily.\r\n\r\n"But the rummiest go I ever recollect in connection with a baby,"\r\ncontinued Henry after a while, his gaze still fixed upon the\r\ndistant snow-crowned peaks, "happened to me at Warwick in the\r\nJubilee year. I\'ll never forget that."\r\n\r\n"Is it a proper story," I asked, "a story fit for me to hear?"\r\n\r\nOn consideration, Henry saw no harm in it, and told it to me\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nHe came by the \'bus that meets the 4.52. He\'d a handbag and a sort\r\nof hamper: it looked to me like a linen-basket. He wouldn\'t let\r\nthe Boots touch the hamper, but carried it up into his bedroom\r\nhimself. He carried it in front of him by the handles, and grazed\r\nhis knuckles at every second step. He slipped going round the bend\r\nof the stairs, and knocked his head a rattling good thump against\r\nthe balustrade; but he never let go that hamper--only swore and\r\nplunged on. I could see he was nervous and excited, but one gets\r\nused to nervous and excited people in hotels. Whether a man\'s\r\nrunning away from a thing, or running after a thing, he stops at\r\na hotel on his way; and so long as he looks as if he could pay his\r\nbill one doesn\'t trouble much about him. But this man interested\r\nme: he was so uncommonly young and innocent-looking. Besides, it\r\nwas a dull hole of a place after the sort of jobs I\'d been used\r\nto; and when you\'ve been doing nothing for three months but\r\nwaiting on commercial gents as are having an exceptionally\r\nbad season, and spoony couples with guide-books, you get a bit\r\ndepressed, and welcome any incident, however slight, that promises\r\nto be out of the common.\r\n\r\nI followed him up into his room, and asked him if I could do\r\nanything for him. He flopped the hamper on the bed with a sigh of\r\nrelief, took off his hat, wiped his head with his handkerchief,\r\nand then turned to answer me.\r\n\r\n"Are you a married man?" says he.\r\n\r\nIt was an odd question to put to a waiter, but coming from a gent\r\nthere was nothing to be alarmed about.\r\n\r\n"Well, not exactly," I says--I was only engaged at that time, and\r\nthat not to my wife, if you understand what I mean--"but I know a\r\ngood deal about it," I says, "and if it\'s a matter of advice--"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that," he answers, interrupting me; "but I don\'t want\r\nyou to laugh at me. I thought if you were a married man you\r\nwould be able to understand the thing better. Have you got an\r\nintelligent woman in the house?"\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got women," I says. "As to their intelligence, that\'s a\r\nmatter of opinion; they\'re the average sort of women. Shall I call\r\nthe chambermaid?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, do," he says. "Wait a minute," he says; "we\'ll open it\r\nfirst."\r\n\r\nHe began to fumble with the cord, then he suddenly lets go and\r\nbegins to chuckle to himself.\r\n\r\n"No," he says, "you open it. Open it carefully; it will surprise\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nI don\'t take much stock in surprises myself. My experience is that\r\nthey\'re mostly unpleasant.\r\n\r\n"What\'s in it?" I says.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll see if you open it," he says: "it won\'t hurt you." And off\r\nhe goes again, chuckling to himself.\r\n\r\n"Well," I says to myself, "I hope you\'re a harmless specimen."\r\nThen an idea struck me, and I stopped with the knot in my fingers.\r\n\r\n"It ain\'t a corpse," I says, "is it?"\r\n\r\nHe turned as white as the sheet on the bed, and clutched the\r\nmantlepiece. "Good God! don\'t suggest such a thing," he says; "I\r\nnever thought of that. Open it quickly."\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather you came and opened it yourself, sir," I says. I was\r\nbeginning not to half like the business.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t," he says, "after that suggestion of yours--you\'ve put me\r\nall in a tremble. Open it quick, man; tell me it\'s all right."\r\n\r\nWell, my own curiosity helped me. I cut the cord, threw open the\r\nlid, and looked in. He kept his eyes turned away, as if he were\r\nfrightened to look for himself.\r\n\r\n"Is it all right?" he says. "Is it alive?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s about as alive," I says, "as anybody\'ll ever want it to be,\r\nI should say."\r\n\r\n"Is it breathing all right?" he says.\r\n\r\n"If you can\'t hear it breathing," I says, "I\'m afraid you\'re\r\ndeaf."\r\n\r\nYou might have heard its breathing outside in the street. He\r\nlistened, and even he was satisfied.\r\n\r\n"Thank Heaven!" he says, and down he plumped in the easy-chair by\r\nthe fireplace. "You know, I never thought of that," he goes on.\r\n"He\'s been shut up in that basket for over an hour, and if by any\r\nchance he\'d managed to get his head entangled in the clothes--I\'ll\r\nnever do such a fool\'s trick again!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re fond of it?" I says.\r\n\r\nHe looked round at me. "Fond of it," he repeats. "Why, I\'m his\r\nfather." And then he begins to laugh again.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" I says. "Then I presume I have the pleasure of addressing\r\nMr. Coster King?"\r\n\r\n"Coster King?" he answers in surprise. "My name\'s Milberry."\r\n\r\nI says: "The father of this child, according to the label inside\r\nthe cover, is Coster King out of Starlight, his mother being Jenny\r\nDeans out of Darby the Devil."\r\n\r\nHe looks at me in a nervous fashion, and puts the chair between\r\nus. It was evidently his turn to think as how I was mad.\r\nSatisfying himself, I suppose, that at all events I wasn\'t\r\ndangerous, he crept closer till he could get a look inside the\r\nbasket. I never heard a man give such an unearthly yell in all my\r\nlife. He stood on one side of the bed and I on the other. The dog,\r\nawakened by the noise, sat up and grinned, first at one of us and\r\nthen at the other. I took it to be a bull-pup of about nine months\r\nold, and a fine specimen for its age.\r\n\r\n"My child!" he shrieks, with his eyes starting out of his head,\r\n"That thing isn\'t my child. What\'s happened? Am I going mad?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re on that way," I says, and so he was. "Calm yourself," I\r\nsays; "what did you expect to see?"\r\n\r\n"My child," he shrieks again; "my only child--my baby!"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean a real child?" I says, "a human child?" Some folks\r\nhave such a silly way of talking about their dogs--you never can\r\ntell.\r\n\r\n"Of course I do," he says; "the prettiest child you ever saw in\r\nall your life, just thirteen weeks old on Sunday. He cut his first\r\ntooth yesterday."\r\n\r\nThe sight of the dog\'s face seemed to madden him. He flung himself\r\nupon the basket, and would, I believe, have strangled the poor\r\nbeast if I hadn\'t interposed between them.\r\n\r\n"\'Tain\'t the dog\'s fault," I says; "I daresay he\'s as sick about\r\nthe whole business as you are. He\'s lost, too. Somebody\'s been\r\nhaving a lark with you. They\'ve took your baby out and put this\r\nin--that is, if there ever was a baby there."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" he says.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," I says, "if you\'ll excuse me, gentlemen in their\r\nsober senses don\'t take their babies about in dog-baskets. Where\r\ndo you come from?"\r\n\r\n"From Banbury," he says; "I\'m well known in Banbury."\r\n\r\n"I can quite believe it," I says; "you\'re the sort of young man\r\nthat would be known anywhere."\r\n\r\n"I\'m Mr. Milberry," he says, "the grocer, in the High Street."\r\n\r\n"Then what are you doing here with this dog?" I says.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t irritate me," he answers. "I tell you I don\'t know myself.\r\nMy wife\'s stopping here at Warwick, nursing her mother, and in\r\nevery letter she\'s written home for the last fortnight she\'s said,\r\n\'Oh, how I do long to see Eric! If only I could see Eric for a\r\nmoment!\'"\r\n\r\n"A very motherly sentiment," I says, "which does her credit."\r\n\r\n"So this afternoon," continues he, "it being early-closing day,\r\nI thought I\'d bring the child here, so that she might see it, and\r\nsee that it was all right. She can\'t leave her mother for more\r\nthan about an hour, and I can\'t go up to the house, because the\r\nold lady doesn\'t like me, and I excite her. I wish to wait here,\r\nand Milly--that\'s my wife--was to come to me when she could get\r\naway. I meant this to be a surprise to her."\r\n\r\n"And I guess," I says, "it will be the biggest one you have ever\r\ngiven her."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t try to be funny about it," he says; "I\'m not altogether\r\nmyself, and I may do you an injury."\r\n\r\nHe was right. It wasn\'t a subject for joking, though it had its\r\nhumorous side.\r\n\r\n"But why," I says, "put it in a dog-basket?"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t a dog-basket," he answers irritably; "it\'s a picnic\r\nhamper. At the last moment I found I hadn\'t got the face to carry\r\nthe child in my arms: I thought of what the street-boys would call\r\nout after me. He\'s a rare one to sleep, and I thought if I made\r\nhim comfortable in that he couldn\'t hurt, just for so short a\r\njourney. I took it in the carriage with me, and carried it on my\r\nknees; I haven\'t let it out of my hands a blessed moment. It\'s\r\nwitchcraft, that\'s what it is. I shall believe in the devil after\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be ridiculous," I says, "there\'s some explanation; it\r\nonly wants finding. You are sure this is the identical hamper you\r\npacked the child in?"\r\n\r\nHe was calmer now. He leant over and examined it carefully. "It\r\nlooks like it," he says; "but I can\'t swear to it."\r\n\r\n"You tell me," I says, "you never let it go out of your hands. Now\r\nthink."\r\n\r\n"No," he says, "it\'s been on my knees all the time."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s nonsense," I says; "unless you packed the dog yourself\r\nin mistake for your baby. Now think it over quietly. I\'m not your\r\nwife, I\'m only trying to help you. I shan\'t say anything even if\r\nyou did take your eyes off the thing for a minute."\r\n\r\nHe thought again, and a light broke over his face. "By Jove!"\r\nhe says, "you\'re right. I did put it down for a moment on the\r\nplatform at Banbury while I bought a \'Tit-Bits.\'"\r\n\r\n"There you are," I says; "now you\'re talking sense. And wait a\r\nminute; isn\'t to-morrow the first day of the Birmingham Dog Show?"\r\n\r\n"I believe you\'re right," he says.\r\n\r\n"Now we\'re getting warm," I says. "By a coincidence this dog was\r\nbeing taken to Birmingham, packed in a hamper exactly similar to\r\nthe one you put your baby in. You\'ve got this man\'s bull-pup, he\'s\r\ngot your baby; and I wouldn\'t like to say off-hand at this moment\r\nwhich of you\'s feeling the madder. As likely as not, he thinks\r\nyou\'ve done it on purpose."\r\n\r\nHe leant his head against the bed-post and groaned. "Milly may\r\nbe here at any moment," says he, "and I\'ll have to tell her the\r\nbaby\'s been sent by mistake to a Dog Show! I daresn\'t do it," he\r\nsays, "I daresn\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"Go on to Birmingham," I says, "and try and find it. You can catch\r\nthe quarter to six and be back here before eight."\r\n\r\n"Come with me," he says; "you\'re a good man, come with me. I ain\'t\r\nfit to go by myself."\r\n\r\nHe was right; he\'d have got run over outside the door, the state\r\nhe was in then.\r\n\r\n"Well," I says, "if the guv\'nor don\'t object--"\r\n\r\n"Oh! he won\'t, he can\'t," cries the young fellow, wringing his\r\nhands. "Tell him it\'s a matter of a life\'s happiness. Tell him--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell him it\'s a matter of half sovereign extra on to the\r\nbill," I says. "That\'ll more likely do the trick."\r\n\r\nAnd so it did, with the result that in another twenty minutes\r\nme and young Milberry and the bull-pup in its hamper were in\r\na third-class carriage on our way to Birmingham. Then the\r\ndifficulties of the chase began to occur to me. Suppose by luck I\r\nwas right; suppose the pup was booked for the Birmingham Dog Show;\r\nand suppose by a bit more luck a gent with a hamper answering\r\ndescription had been noticed getting out of the 5.13 train; then\r\nwhere were we? We might have to interview every cabman in the\r\ntown. As likely as not, by the time we did find the kid, it\r\nwouldn\'t be worth the trouble of unpacking. Still, it wasn\'t my\r\ncue to blab my thoughts. The father, poor fellow, was feeling, I\r\ntake it, just about as bad as he wanted to feel. My business was\r\nto put hope into him; so when he asked me for about the twentieth\r\ntime if I thought as he would ever see his child alive again, I\r\nsnapped him up shortish.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you fret yourself about that," I says. "You\'ll see a good\r\ndeal of that child before you\'ve done with it. Babies ain\'t the\r\nsort of things as gets lost easily. It\'s only on the stage that\r\nfolks ever have any particular use for other people\'s children.\r\nI\'ve known some bad characters in my time, but I\'d have trusted\r\nthe worst of \'em with a wagon-load of other people\'s kids. Don\'t\r\nyou flatter yourself you\'re going to lose it! Whoever\'s got it,\r\nyou take it from me, his idea is to do the honest thing, and never\r\nrest till he\'s succeeded in returning it to the rightful owner."\r\n\r\nWell, my talking like that cheered him, and when we reached\r\nBirmingham he was easier. We tackled the station-master, and he\r\ntackled all the porters who could have been about the platform\r\nwhen the 5.13 came in. All of \'em agreed that no gent got out of\r\nthat train carrying a hamper. The station-master was a family man\r\nhimself, and when we explained the case to him he sympathised and\r\ntelegraphed to Banbury. The booking-clerk at Banbury remembered\r\nonly three gents booking by that particular train. One had been\r\nMr. Jessop, the corn-chandler; the second was a stranger, who had\r\nbooked to Wolverhampton; and the third had been young Milberry\r\nhimself. The business began to look hopeless, when one of Smith\'s\r\nnewsboys, who was hanging around, struck in:\r\n\r\n"I see an old lady," says he, "hovering about outside the station,\r\nand a-hailing cabs, and she had a hamper with her as was as like\r\nthat one there as two peas."\r\n\r\nI thought young Milberry would have fallen upon the boy\'s neck and\r\nkissed him. With the boy to help us, we started among the cabmen.\r\nOld ladies with dog-baskets ain\'t so difficult to trace. She had\r\ngone to a small second-rate hotel in the Aston Road. I heard all\r\nparticulars from the chambermaid, and the old girl seems to have\r\nhad as bad a time in her way as my gent had in his. They couldn\'t\r\nget the hamper into the cab, it had to go on the top. The old lady\r\nwas very worried, as it was raining at the time, and she made\r\nthe cabman cover it with his apron. Getting it off the cab they\r\ndropped the whole thing in the road; that woke the child up, and\r\nit began to cry.\r\n\r\n"Good Lord, Ma\'am! what is it?" asks the chambermaid, "a baby?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear, it\'s my baby," answers the old lady, who seems to\r\nhave been a cheerful sort of old soul--leastways, she was cheerful\r\nup to then. "Poor dear, I hope they haven\'t hurt him."\r\n\r\nThe old lady had ordered a room with a fire in it. The Boots took\r\nthe hamper up, and laid it on the hearthrug. The old lady said she\r\nand the chambermaid would see to it, and turned him out. By this\r\ntime, according to the girl\'s account, it was roaring like a\r\nsteam-siren.\r\n\r\n"Pretty dear!" says the old lady, fumbling with the cord, "don\'t\r\ncry; mother\'s opening it as fast as she can." Then she turns to\r\nthe chambermaid--"If you open my bag," says she, "you will find a\r\nbottle of milk and some dog-biscuits."\r\n\r\n"Dog-biscuits!" says the chambermaid.\r\n\r\n"Yes," says the old lady, laughing, "my baby loves dog-biscuits."\r\n\r\nThe girl opened the bag, and there, sure enough, was a bottle of\r\nmilk and half a dozen Spratt\'s biscuits. She had her back to the\r\nold lady, when she heard a sort of a groan and a thud as made\r\nher turn round. The old lady was lying stretched dead on the\r\nhearthrug--so the chambermaid thought. The kid was sitting up in\r\nthe hamper yelling the roof off. In her excitement, not knowing\r\nwhat she was doing, she handed it a biscuit, which it snatched at\r\ngreedily and began sucking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0119]\r\n\r\nThen she set to work to slap the old lady back to life again. In\r\nabout a minute the poor old soul opened her eyes and looked round.\r\nThe baby was quiet now, gnawing the dog-biscuit. The old lady\r\nlooked at the child, then turned and hid her face against the\r\nchambermaid\'s bosom.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" she says, speaking in an awed voice. "The thing in\r\nthe hamper?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a baby, Ma\'am," says the maid.\r\n\r\n"You\'re sure it ain\'t a dog?" says the old lady. "Look again."\r\n\r\nThe girl began to feel nervous, and to wish that she wasn\'t alone\r\nwith the old lady.\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t likely to mistake a dog for a baby, Ma\'am," says the\r\ngirl. "It\'s a child--a human infant."\r\n\r\nThe old lady began to cry softly. "It\'s a judgment on me," she\r\nsays. "I used to talk to that dog as if it had been a Christian,\r\nand now this thing has happened as a punishment."\r\n\r\n"What\'s happened?" says the chambermaid, who was naturally enough\r\ngrowing more and more curious.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," says the old lady, sitting up on the floor. "If\r\nthis isn\'t a dream, and if I ain\'t mad, I started from my home at\r\nFarthinghoe, two hours ago, with a one-year-old bulldog packed in\r\nthat hamper. You saw me open it; you see what\'s inside it now."\r\n\r\n"But bulldogs," says the chambermaid, "ain\'t changed into babies\r\nby magic."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how it\'s done," says the old lady, "and I don\'t see\r\nthat it matters. I know I started with a bulldog, and somehow or\r\nother it\'s got turned into that."\r\n\r\n"Somebody\'s put it there," says the chambermaid; "somebody as\r\nwanted to get rid of a child. They\'ve took your dog out and put\r\nthat in its place."\r\n\r\n"They must have been precious smart," says the old lady; "the\r\nhamper hasn\'t been out of my sight for more than five minutes,\r\nwhen I went into the refreshment-room at Banbury for a cup of\r\ntea."\r\n\r\n"That\'s when they did it," says the chambermaid, "and a clever\r\ntrick it was."\r\n\r\nThe old lady suddenly grasped her position, and jumped up from the\r\nfloor. "And a nice thing for me," she says. "An unmarried woman in\r\na scandal-mongering village! This is awful!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a fine-looking child," says the chambermaid.\r\n\r\n"Would you like it?" says the old lady.\r\n\r\nThe chambermaid said she wouldn\'t. The old lady sat down and\r\ntried to think, and the more she thought the worse she felt. The\r\nchambermaid was positive that if we hadn\'t come when we did the\r\npoor creature would have gone mad. When the Boots appeared at the\r\ndoor to say there was a gent and a bulldog downstairs enquiring\r\nafter a baby, she flung her arms round the man\'s neck and hugged\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWe just caught the train to Warwick, and by luck got back to the\r\nhotel ten minutes before the mother turned up. Young Milberry\r\ncarried the child in his arms all the way. He said I could have\r\nthe hamper for myself, and gave me half-a-sovereign extra on the\r\nunderstanding that I kept my mouth shut, which I did.\r\n\r\nI don\'t think he ever told the child\'s mother what had\r\nhappened--leastways, if he wasn\'t a fool right through, he didn\'t.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROBATION OF JAMES WRENCH\r\n\r\n\r\n|There are two sorts of men as gets hen-pecked," remarked Henry--I\r\nforgot how the subject had originated, but we had been discussing\r\nthe merits of Henry VIII., considered as a father and a\r\nhusband,--"the sort as likes it and the sort as don\'t, and I\r\nwouldn\'t be too cocksure that the sort as does isn\'t on the whole\r\nin the majority.\r\n\r\n"You see," continued Henry argumentatively, "it gives, as it were,\r\na kind of interest to life which nowadays, with everything going\r\nsmoothly, and no chance of a row anywhere except in your own\r\nhouse, is apt to become a bit monotonous. There was a chap I got\r\nto know pretty well one winter when I was working in Dresden\r\nat the Europaischer Hof: a quiet, meek little man he was, a\r\njourneyman butcher by trade; and his wife was a dressmaker, a\r\nSchneiderin, as they call them over there, and ran a fairly big\r\nbusiness in the Praguer Strasse. I\'ve always been told that German\r\nhusbands are the worst going, treating their wives like slaves,\r\nor, at the best, as mere upper servants. But my experience is that\r\nhuman nature don\'t alter so much according to distance from London\r\nas we fancy it does, and that husbands have their troubles same\r\nas wives all the world over. Anyhow, I\'ve come across a German\r\nhusband or two as didn\'t carry about with him any sign of the\r\nslave driver such as you might notice, at all events not in his\r\nown house; and I know for a fact that Meister Anton, which was the\r\nname of the chap I\'m telling you about, couldn\'t have been much\r\nworse off, not even if he\'d been an Englishman born and bred.\r\nThere were no children to occupy her mind, so she just devoted\r\nherself to him and the work-girls, and made things hum, as they\r\nsay in America, for all of them. As for the girls, they got away\r\nat six in the evening, and not many of them stopped more than the\r\nfirst month. But the old man, not being able to give notice, had\r\nto put up with an average of eighteen hours a day of it. And even\r\nwhen, as was sometimes the case, he managed to get away for an\r\nhour or two in the evening for a quiet talk with a few of us over\r\na glass of beer, he could never be quite happy, thinking of what\r\nwas accumulating for him at home. Of course everybody as knew him\r\nknew of his troubles--for a scolding wife ain\'t the sort of thing\r\nas can be hid under a bushel,--and was sorry for him, he being as\r\namiable and good-tempered a fellow as ever lived, and most of us\r\nspent our time with him advising him for his good. Some of the\r\nmore ardent would give him recipes for managing her, but they,\r\nbeing generally speaking bachelors, their suggestions lacked\r\npracticability, as you might say. One man bored his life out\r\npersuading him to try a bucket of cold water. He was one of\r\nthose cold-water enthusiasts, this fellow; took it himself for\r\neverything, and always went to a hydropathic establishment for\r\nhis holidays. Rumour had it that Meister Anton really did try\r\nthis experiment on one unfortunate occasion--worried into it, I\r\nsuppose, by the other chap\'s persistency. Anyhow, we didn\'t see\r\nhim again for a week, he being confined to his bed with a chill on\r\nthe liver. And the next suggestion made to him he rejected quite\r\nhuffily, explaining that he had no intention of putting any fresh\r\nideas into his wife\'s head.\r\n\r\n"She wasn\'t a bad woman, mind you--merely given to fits of temper.\r\nAt times she could be quite pleasant: but when she wasn\'t life\r\nwith her must have been exciting. He had stood it for about seven\r\nyears; and then one day, without a word of warning to anyone, he\r\nwent away and left her. As she was quite able to keep herself,\r\nthis seemed to be the best arrangement possible, and everybody\r\nwondered why he had never thought of it before, I did not see him\r\nagain for nine months, until I ran against him by pure chance on\r\nthe Koln platform, where I was waiting for a train to Paris. He\r\ntold me they had made up all their differences by correspondence,\r\nand that he was then on his way back to her. He seemed quite\r\ncheerful and expectant.\r\n\r\n"\'Do you think she\'s really reformed?\' I says. \'Do you think nine\r\nmonths is long enough to have taught her a lesson?\' I didn\'t want\r\nto damp him, but personally I have never known but one case of a\r\nwoman being cured of nagging, and that being brought about by\r\na fall from a third-story window, resulting in what the doctors\r\ncalled permanent paralysis of the vocal organs, can hardly be\r\ntaken as a precedent.\r\n\r\n"\'No,\' he answers, \'nor nine years. But it\'s been long enough to\r\nteach me a lesson.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You know me,\' he goes on. \'I ain\'t a quarrelsome sort of chap.\r\nIf nobody says a word to me, I never says a word to anybody; and\r\nit\'s been like that ever since I left her, day in and day out, all\r\njust the same. Up in the morning, do your bit of work, drink your\r\nglass of beer, and to bed in the evening; nothing to excite you,\r\nnothing to rouse you. Why, it\'s a mere animal existence.\'\r\n\r\n"He was a rum sort of chap, always thought things out from his own\r\npoint of view as it were."\r\n\r\n"Yes, a curious case," I remarked to Henry; "not the sort of story\r\nto put about, however. It might give women the idea that nagging\r\nis attractive, and encourage them to try it upon husbands who do\r\nnot care for that kind of excitement."\r\n\r\n"Not much fear of that," replied Henry. "The nagging woman is\r\nborn, as they say, not made; and she\'ll nag like the roses bloom,\r\nnot because she wants to, but because she can\'t help it. And a\r\nwoman to whom it don\'t come natural will never be any real good\r\nat it, try as she may. And as for the men, why we\'ll just go on\r\nselecting wives according to the old rule, so that you never know\r\nwhat you\'ve got till it\'s too late for you to do anything but make\r\nthe best or the worst of it, according as your fancy takes you.\r\n\r\n"There was a fellow," continued Henry, "as used to work with me\r\na good many years ago now at a small hotel in the City. He was\r\na waiter, like myself--not a bad sort of chap, though a bit of\r\na toff in his off-hours. He\'d been engaged for some two or three\r\nyears to one of the chambermaids. A pretty, gentle-looking little\r\nthing she was, with big childish eyes, and a voice like the\r\npouring out of water. They are strange things, women; one can\r\nnever tell what they are made of from the taste of them. And while\r\nI was there, it having been a good season for both of them, they\r\nthought they\'d risk it and get married. They did the sensible\r\nthing, he coming back to his work after the week\'s holiday, and\r\nshe to hers; the only difference being that they took a couple of\r\nrooms of their own in Middleton Row, from where in summer-time you\r\ncan catch the glimpse of a green tree or two, and slept out.\r\n\r\n"The first few months they were as happy as a couple in a play,\r\nshe thinking almost as much of him as he thought of himself, which\r\nmust have been a comfort to both of them, and he as proud of her\r\nas if he made her himself. And then some fifteenth cousin or so of\r\nhis, a man he had never heard of before, died in New Zealand and\r\nleft him a fortune.\r\n\r\n"That was the beginning of his troubles, and hers too. I don\'t say\r\nit was enough to buy a peerage, but to a man accustomed to dream\r\nof half-crown tips it seemed an enormous fortune. Anyhow, it was\r\nsufficient to turn his head and give him ideas above his station.\r\nHis first move, of course, was to chuck his berth and set fire to\r\nhis dress suit, which, being tolerably greasy, burned well. Had\r\nhe stopped there nobody could have blamed him. I\'ve often thought\r\nmyself that I would willingly give ten years of my life, provided\r\nanybody wanted them, which I don\'t see how they should, to put\r\nmy own behind the fire. But he didn\'t. He took a house in a mews,\r\nwith the front door in a street off Grosvenor Square, furnished\r\nit like a second-class German restaurant, dressed himself like\r\na bookmaker, and fancied that with the help of a few shady City\r\nchaps and a broken-down swell or two he had gathered round him, he\r\nwas fairly on the road to Park Lane and the House of Lords.\r\n\r\n"And the only thing that struck him as being at all in his way was\r\nhis wife. In her cap and apron, or her Sunday print she had always\r\nlooked as dainty and fetching a little piece of goods as a man\r\ncould wish to be seen out with. Dressed according to the advice of\r\nhis new-found friends, of course she looked like nothing else\r\nso much as a barn-yard chicken in turkey-cock\'s feathers. He was\r\nshocked to find that her size in gloves was seven-and-a-quarter,\r\nand in boots something over four, and that sort of thing naturally\r\nirritates a woman more even than finding fault with her immortal\r\nsoul. I guess for about a year he made her life pretty well a\r\nburden for her, trying to bring her up to the standard of the\r\nSaturday-to-Monday-at-Brighton set with which he had surrounded\r\nhimself, or which, to speak more correctly, had got round him.\r\nShe\'d a precious sight more gumption than he had ever possessed,\r\nand if he had listened to her instead of insisting upon her\r\nlistening to him it would have been better for him. But there are\r\nsome men who think that if you have a taste for champagne and the\r\nballet that proves you are intended by nature for a nob, and he\r\nwas one of them; and any common-sense suggestion of hers only\r\nconvinced him of her natural unfitness for an exalted station.\r\n\r\n"He grumbled at her accent, which, seeing that his own was\r\nacquired in Lime-house and finished off in the Minories, was just\r\nthe sort of thing a fool would do. And he insisted on her reading\r\nall the society novels as they came out--you know the sort I\r\nmean,--where everybody snaps everybody else\'s head off, and all\r\nthe proverbs are upside down; people leave them about the hotels\r\nwhen they\'ve done with them, and one gets into the habit of\r\ndipping into them when one\'s nothing better to do. His hope was\r\nthat she might, with pains, get to talk like these books. That was\r\nhis ideal.\r\n\r\n"She did her best, but of course the more she got away from\r\nherself the more absurd she became; and the rubbish and worse that\r\nhe had about him would ridicule her more or less openly. And he,\r\ninstead of kicking them out into the mews--which could have been\r\ndone easily without Grosvenor Square knowing anything about it,\r\nand thereby having its high-class feelings hurt--he would blame\r\nher when they had all gone, just as if it was her fault that she\r\nwas the daughter of a respectable bootmaker in the Mile End Road\r\ninstead of something more likely than not turned out of the third\r\nrow of the ballet because it couldn\'t dance, and didn\'t want to\r\nlearn.\r\n\r\n"He played a bit in the City, and won at first, and that swelled\r\nhis head worse than ever. It also brought him a good deal of\r\nsympathy from an Italian Countess, the sort you find at Homburg,\r\nand that generally speaking is a widow. Her chief sorrow was for\r\nsociety--that in him was losing an ornament. She explained to him\r\nhow an accomplished and experienced woman could help a man to gain\r\nadmittance into the tiptop circles, which, according to her, were\r\njust thirsting for him. As a waiter, he had his share of brains,\r\nand it\'s a business that requires more insight than perhaps you\'d\r\nfancy, if you don\'t want to waste your time on a rabbit-skin coat\r\nand a paste ring, and give the burnt sole to the real gent. But in\r\nthe hands of this swell mob he was, of course, just the young man\r\nfrom the country; and the end of it was that he played the game\r\ndown pretty low.\r\n\r\n"She--not the Countess, I shouldn\'t like you to have that idea,\r\nbut his wife--came to be pretty friendly with my missus later on,\r\nand that\'s how I got to know the details. He comes to her one day\r\nlooking pretty sheepish-like, as one can well believe, and maybe\r\nhe\'d been drinking a bit to give himself courage.\r\n\r\n"\'We ain\'t been getting along too well together of late, have we,\r\nSusan?\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'We ain\'t seen much of one another,\' she answers; \'but I agree\r\nwith you, we don\'t seem to enjoy it much when we do.\'\r\n\r\n"\'It ain\'t your fault,\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'I\'m glad you think that,\' she answers; \'it shows me you ain\'t\r\nquite as foolish as I was beginning to think you.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Of course, I didn\'t know when I married you,\' he goes on, \'as I\r\nwas going to come into this money.\'\r\n\r\n"\'No, nor I either,\' says she, \'or you bet it wouldn\'t have\r\nhappened.\'\r\n\r\n"\'It seems to have been a bit of a mistake,\' says he, \'as things\r\nhave turned out.\'\r\n\r\n"\'It would have been a mistake, and more than a bit of a one in\r\nany case,\' answers she.\r\n\r\n"\'I\'m glad you agree with me,\' says he; \'there\'ll be no need to\r\nquarrel.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I\'ve always tried to agree with you,\' says she. \'We\'ve never\r\nquarrelled yet, and that ought to be sufficient proof to you that\r\nwe never shall.\'\r\n\r\n"\'It\'s a mistake that can be rectified,\' says he, \'if you are\r\nsensible, and that without any harm to anyone.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Oh!\' says she, \'it must be a new sort of mistake, that kind.\'\r\n\r\n"\'We\'re not fitted for one another,\' says he.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0145]\r\n\r\n"\'Out with it,\' says she. \'Don\'t you be afraid of my feelings;\r\nthey are well under control, as I think I can fairly say by this\r\ntime.\'\r\n\r\n"\'With a man in your own station of life,\' says he, \'you\'d be\r\nhappier.\'\r\n\r\n"\'There\'s many a man I might have been happier with,\' replies she.\r\n\'That ain\'t the thing to be discussed, seeing as I\'ve got you.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You might get rid of me,\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'You mean you might get rid of me,\' she answers.\r\n\r\n"\'It comes to the same thing,\' he says.\r\n\r\n"\'No, it don\'t,\' she replies, \'nor anything like it. I shouldn\'t\r\nhave got rid of you for my pleasure, and I\'m not going to do it\r\nfor yours. You can live like a decent man, and I\'ll go on putting\r\nup with you; or you can live like a fool, and I shan\'t stand in\r\nyour way. But you can\'t do both, and I\'m not going to help you\r\ntry.\'\r\n\r\n"Well, he argued with her, and he tried the coaxing dodge, and he\r\ntried the bullying dodge, but it didn\'t work, neither of it.\r\n\r\n"\'I\'ve done my duty by you,\' says she, \'so far as I\'ve been able,\r\nand that I\'ll go on doing or not, just as you please; but I don\'t\r\ndo more.\'\r\n\r\n"\'We can\'t go on living like this,\' says he, \'and it isn\'t fair to\r\nask me to. You\'re hammering my prospects.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I don\'t want to do that,\' says she. \'You take your proper\r\nposition in society, whatever that may be, and I\'ll take mine.\r\nI\'ll be glad enough to get back to it, you may rest assured.\'\r\n\r\n"\'What do you mean?\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'It\'s simple enough,\' she answers. \'I was earning my living\r\nbefore I married you, and I can earn it again. You go your way, I\r\ngo mine.\'\r\n\r\n"It didn\'t satisfy him; but there was nothing else to be done, and\r\nthere was no moving her now in any other direction whatever, even\r\nhad he wanted to. He offered her anything in the way of money--he\r\nwasn\'t a mean chap,--but she wouldn\'t touch a penny. She had\r\nkept her old clothes--I\'m not sure that some idea of needing them\r\nhadn\'t always been in her head,--applied for a place under her\r\nformer manager, who was then bossing a hotel in Kensington,\r\nand got it. And there was an end of high life so far as she was\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n"As for him, he went the usual way. It always seems to me as if\r\nmen and women were just like water; sooner or later they get\r\nback to the level from which they started--that is, of course,\r\ngenerally speaking. Here and there a drop clings where it climbs;\r\nbut, taking them on the whole, pumping-up is a slow business.\r\nLord! I have seen them, many of them, jolly clever they\'ve thought\r\nthemselves, with their diamond rings and big cigars. \'Wait a bit,\'\r\nI\'ve always said to myself, \'there\'ll come a day when you\'ll walk\r\nin and be glad enough of your chop and potatoes again with your\r\nhalf-pint of bitter.\' And nine cases out of ten I\'ve been right.\r\nJames Wrench followed the course of the majority, only a little\r\nmore so: tried to do others a precious sight sharper than himself,\r\nand got done; tried a dozen times to scramble up again, each time\r\ncoming down heavier than before, till there wasn\'t another spring\r\nleft in him, and his only ambition victuals. Then, of course, he\r\nthought of his wife--it\'s a wonderful domesticator, ill luck--and\r\nwondered what she was doing.\r\n\r\n"Fortunately for him, she\'d been doing well. Her father died and\r\nleft her a bit, just a couple of hundred or so, and with this and\r\nher own savings she started with a small inn in a growing town,\r\nand had sold out again three years later at four times what she\r\nhad paid for it. She had done even better than that for herself.\r\nShe had developed a talent for cooking--that was a settled\r\nincome in itself,--and at this time was running a small hotel in\r\nBrighton, and making it pay to a tune that would have made the\r\nshareholders of some of its bigger rivals a bit envious could they\r\nhave known.\r\n\r\n"He came to me, having found out, I don\'t know how--necessity\r\nsmartens the wits, I suppose,--that my missis still kept up a sort\r\nof friendship with her, and begged me to try and arrange a meeting\r\nbetween them, which I did, though I told him frankly that from\r\nwhat I knew his welcome wouldn\'t be much more enthusiastic than\r\nwhat he\'d any right to expect. But he was always of a sanguine\r\ndisposition; and borrowing his fare and an old greatcoat of mine,\r\nhe started off, evidently thinking that all his troubles were\r\nover.\r\n\r\n"But they weren\'t exactly. The Married Women\'s Property Act had\r\naltered things a bit, and Master James found himself greeted\r\nwithout any suggestion of tenderness by a business-like woman of\r\nthirty-six or thereabouts, and told to wait in the room behind the\r\nbar till she could find time to talk to him.\r\n\r\n"She kept him waiting there for three-quarters of an hour, just\r\nsufficient time to take the side out of him; and then she walks in\r\nand closes the door behind her.\r\n\r\n"\'I\'d say you hadn\'t changed hardly a day, Susan,\' says he, \'if it\r\nwasn\'t that you\'d grown handsomer than ever.\'\r\n\r\n"I guess he\'d been turning that over in his mind during the\r\nthree-quarters of an hour. It was his fancy that he knew a bit\r\nabout women.\r\n\r\n"\'My name\'s Mrs. Wrench,\' says she; \'and if you take your hat off\r\nand stand up while I\'m talking to you it will be more what I\'m\r\naccustomed to.\'\r\n\r\n"Well, that staggered him a bit; but there didn\'t seem anything\r\nelse to be done, so he just made as if he thought it funny, though\r\nI doubt if at the time he saw the full humour of it.\r\n\r\n"\'And now, what do you want?" says she, seating herself in front\r\nof her desk, and leaving him standing, first on one leg and then\r\non the other, twiddling his hat in his hands.\r\n\r\n"\'I\'ve been a bad husband to you, Susan,\' begins he.\r\n\r\n"\'I could have told you that,\' she answers. \'What I asked you was\r\nwhat you wanted.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I want for us to let bygones be bygones,\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'That\'s quite my own idea,\' says she, \'and if you don\'t allude to\r\nthe past, I shan\'t.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You\'re an angel, Susan,\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'I\'ve told you once,\' answers she, \'that my name\'s Mrs. Wrench.\r\nI\'m Susan to my friends, not to every broken-down tramp looking\r\nfor a job.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Ain\'t I your husband?\' says he, trying a bit of dignity.\r\n\r\n"She got up and took a glance through the glass-door to see that\r\nnobody was there to overhear her.\r\n\r\n"\'For the first and last time,\' says she, \'let you and me\r\nunderstand one another. I\'ve been eleven years without a husband,\r\nand I\'ve got used to it. I don\'t feel now as I want one of any\r\nkind, and if I did it wouldn\'t be your sort. Eleven years ago I\r\nwasn\'t good enough for you, and now you\'re not good enough for\r\nme.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I want to reform,\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'I want to see you do it,\' says she.\r\n\r\n"\'Give me a chance,\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'I\'m going to,\' says she; \'but it\'s going to be my experiment\r\nthis time, not yours. Eleven years ago I didn\'t give you\r\nsatisfaction, so you turned me out of doors.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You went, Susan,\' says he; \'you know it was your own idea.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Don\'t you remind me too much of the circumstances,\' replies she,\r\nturning on him with a look in her eyes that was probably new to\r\nhim, \'I went because there wasn\'t room for two of us; you know\r\nthat. The other kind suited you better. Now I\'m going to see\r\nwhether you suit me,\' and she sits herself again in her landlady\'s\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n"\'In what way?\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'In the way of earning your living,\' says she, \'and starting on\r\nthe road to becoming a decent member of society.\'\r\n\r\n"He stood for a while cogitating.\r\n\r\n"\'Don\'t you think,\' says he at last, \'as I could manage this hotel\r\nfor you?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Thanks,\' says she; \'I\'m doing that myself.\'\r\n\r\n"\'What about looking to the financial side of things,\' says he,\r\n\'and keeping the accounts? It\'s hardly your work.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Nor yours either,\' answers she drily, \'judging by the way you\'ve\r\nbeen keeping your own.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You wouldn\'t like me to be head-waiter, I suppose?\' says he. \'It\r\nwould be a bit of a come-down.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You\'re thinking of the hotel, I suppose,\' says she. \'Perhaps you\r\nare right. My customers are mostly an old-fashioned class; it\'s\r\nprobable enough they might not like you. You had better suggest\r\nsomething else.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I could hardly be an under-waiter,\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'Perhaps not,\' says she; \'your manners strike me as a bit too\r\nfamiliar for that.\'\r\n\r\n"Then he thought he\'d try sarcasm.\r\n\r\n"\'Perhaps you\'d fancy my being the boots,\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'That\'s more reasonable,\' says she. \'You couldn\'t do much harm\r\nthere, and I could keep an eye on you.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You really mean that?\' says he, starting to put on his dignity.\r\n\r\n"But she cut him short by ringing the bell.\r\n\r\n"\'If you think you can do better for yourself,\' she says, \'there\'s\r\nan end of it. By a curious coincidence the place is just now\r\nvacant. I\'ll keep it open for you till to-morrow night; you can\r\nturn it over in your mind.\' And one of the page boys coming in she\r\njust says \'Good-morning,\' and the interview was at an end.\r\n\r\n"Well, he turned it over, and he took the job. He thought she\'d\r\nrelent after the first week or two, but she didn\'t. He just kept\r\nthat place for over fifteen months, and learnt the business.\r\nIn the house he was James the boots, and she Mrs. Wrench the\r\nlandlady, and she saw to it that he didn\'t forget it. He had his\r\nwages and he made his tips, and the food was plentiful; but I take\r\nit he worked harder during that time than he\'d ever worked before\r\nin his life, and found that a landlady is just twice as difficult\r\nto please as the strictest landlord it can be a man\'s misfortune\r\nto get under, and that Mrs. Wrench was no exception to the rule.\r\n\r\n"At the end of the fifteen months she sends for him into the\r\noffice. He didn\'t want telling by this time; he just stood with\r\nhis hat in his hand and waited respectful like.\r\n\r\n"\'James,\' says she, after she had finished what she was doing, \'I\r\nfind I shall want another waiter for the coffee-room this season.\r\nWould you care to try the place?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Thank you, Mrs. Wrench,\' he answers; \'it\'s more what I\'ve been\r\nused to, and I think I\'ll be able to give satisfaction.\'\r\n\r\n"\'There\'s no wages attached, as I suppose you know,\' continues\r\nshe; \'but the second floor goes with it, and if you know your\r\nbusiness you ought to make from twenty-five to thirty shillings a\r\nweek.\'\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Mrs. Wrench; that\'ll suit me very well,\' replies he;\r\nand it was settled.\r\n\r\n"He did better as a waiter; he\'d got it in his blood, as you might\r\nsay; and so after a time he worked up to be head-waiter. Now and\r\nthen, of course, it came about that he found himself waiting on\r\nthe very folks that he\'d been chums with in his classy days, and\r\nthat must have been a bit rough on him. But he\'d taken in a good\r\ndeal of sense since then; and when one of the old sort, all rings\r\nand shirt-front, dining there one Sunday evening, started chaffing\r\nhim, Jimmy just shut him up with a quiet: \'Yes, I guess we were\r\nboth a bit out of our place in those days. The difference between\r\nus now is that I have got back to mine,\' which cost him his tip,\r\nbut must have been a satisfaction to him.\r\n\r\n"Altogether he worked in that hotel for some three and a half\r\nyears, and then Mrs. Wrench sends for him again into the office.\r\n\r\n"\'Sit down, James,\' says she.\r\n\r\n"\'Thank you, Mrs. Wrench,\' says James, and sat.\r\n\r\n"\'I\'m thinking of giving up this hotel, James,\' says she,\r\n\'and taking another near Dover, a quiet place with just such a\r\nclientele as I shall like. Do you care to come with me?\'\r\n\r\n"\'Thank you,\' says he, \'but I\'m thinking, Mrs. Wrench, of making a\r\nchange myself.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Oh,\' says she, \'I\'m sorry to hear that, James. I thought we\'d\r\nbeen getting on very well together.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I\'ve tried to do my best, Mrs. Wrench,\' says he, \'and I hope as\r\nI\'ve given satisfaction.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I\'ve nothing to complain of, James,\' says she.\r\n\r\n"\'I thank you for saying it,\' says he, \'and I thank you for the\r\nopportunity you gave me when I wanted it. It\'s been the making of\r\nme.\'\r\n\r\n"She didn\'t answer for about a minute. Then says she: \'You\'ve been\r\nmeeting some of your old friends, James, I\'m afraid, and they\'ve\r\nbeen persuading you to go back into the City.\'\r\n\r\n"\'No, Mrs. Wrench,\' says he; \'no more City for me, and no more\r\nneighbourhood of Grosvenor Square, unless it be in the way of\r\nbusiness; and that couldn\'t be, of course, for a good long while\r\nto come.\'\r\n\r\n"\'What do you mean by business?\' asks she.\r\n\r\n"\'The hotel business,\' replies he. \'I believe I know the bearings\r\nby now. I\'ve saved a bit, thanks to you, Mrs. Wrench, and a bit\'s\r\ncome in from the wreck that I never hoped for.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Enough to start you?\' asks she.\r\n\r\n"\'Not quite enough for that,\' answers he. \'My idea is a small\r\npartnership.\'\r\n\r\n"\'How much is it altogether?\' says she, \'if it\'s not an\r\nimpertinent question.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Not at all,\' answers he. \'It tots up to 900 pounds about.\'\r\n\r\n"She turns back to her desk and goes on with her writing.\r\n\r\n"\'Dover wouldn\'t suit you, I suppose?\' says she without looking\r\nround.\r\n\r\n"\'Dover\'s all right,\' says he, \'if the business is a good one.\'\r\n\r\n"\'It can be worked up into one of the best things going,\' says\r\nshe, \'and I\'m getting it dirt cheap. You can have a third share\r\nfor a thousand pounds, that\'s just what it\'s costing, and owe me\r\nthe other hundred."\r\n\r\n"\'And what position do I take?\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'If you come in on those terms,\' says she, \'then, of course, it\'s\r\na partnership.\'\r\n\r\n"He rose and came over to her. \'Life isn\'t all business, Susan,\'\r\nsays he.\r\n\r\n"\'I\'ve found it so mostly,\' says she.\r\n\r\n"\'Fourteen years ago,\' says he, \'I made the mistake; now you\'re\r\nmaking it.\'\r\n\r\n"\'What mistake am I making?\' says she.\r\n\r\n"\'That man\'s the only thing as can\'t learn a lesson,\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'Oh,\' says she, \'and what\'s the lesson that you\'ve learnt?\'\r\n\r\n"\'That I never get on without you, Susan,\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'Well,\' says she, \'you suggested a partnership, and I agreed to\r\nit. What more do you want?\'\r\n\r\n"\'I want to know the name of the firm,\' says he.\r\n\r\n"\'Mr. and Mrs. Wrench,\' says she, turning round to him and holding\r\nout her hand. \'How will that suit you?\'\r\n\r\n"\'That\'ll do me all right,\' answers he. \'And I\'ll try and give\r\nsatisfaction,\' adds he.\r\n\r\n"\'I believe you,\' says she.\r\n\r\n"And in that way they made a fresh start, as it were."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOOING OF TOM SLEIGHT\'S WIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n|It\'s competition," replied Henry, "that makes the world go round.\r\nYou never want a thing particularly until you see another fellow\r\ntrying to get it; then it strikes you all of a sudden that you\'ve\r\na better right to it than he has. Take barmaids: what\'s the\r\nattraction about \'em? In looks they\'re no better than the average\r\ngirl in the street; while as for their temper, well that\'s a bit\r\nabove the average--leastways, so far as my experience goes. Yet\r\nthe thinnest of \'em has her dozen, making sheep\'s-eyes at her\r\nacross the counter. I\'ve known girls that on the level couldn\'t\r\nhave got a policeman to look at \'em. Put \'em behind a row of\r\ntumblers and a shilling\'s-worth of stale pastry, and nothing\r\noutside a Lincoln and Bennett is good enough for \'em. It\'s the\r\ncompetition that\'s the making of \'em.\r\n\r\n"Now, I\'ll tell you a story," continued Henry, "that bears upon\r\nthe subject. It\'s a pretty story, if you look at it from one point\r\nof view; though my wife maintains--and she\'s a bit of a judge,\r\nmind you--that it\'s not yet finished, she arguing that there\'s\r\na difference between marrying and being married. You can have a\r\nfancy for the one, without caring much about the other. What\r\nI tell her is that a boy isn\'t a man, and a man isn\'t a boy.\r\nBesides, it\'s five years ago now, and nothing has happened since:\r\nthough of course one can never say."\r\n\r\n"I would like to hear the story," I ventured to suggest; "I\'ll be\r\nable to judge better afterwards."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not a long one," replied Henry, "though as a matter of fact\r\nit began seventeen years ago in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He was\r\na wild young fellow, and always had been."\r\n\r\n"Who was?" I interrupted.\r\n\r\n"Tom Sleight," answered Henry, "the chap I\'m telling you about.\r\nHe belonged to a good family, his father being a Magistrate for\r\nMonmouthshire; but there had been no doing anything with young\r\nTom from the very first. At fifteen he ran away from school\r\nat Clifton, and with everything belonging to him tied up in\r\na pocket-handkerchief made his way to Bristol Docks. There he\r\nshipped as boy on board an American schooner, the Cap\'n not\r\npressing for any particulars, being short-handed, and the boy\r\nhimself not volunteering much. Whether his folks made much of an\r\neffort to get him back, or whether they didn\'t, I can\'t tell you.\r\nMaybe, they thought a little roughing it would knock some sense\r\ninto him. Anyhow, the fact remains that for the next seven or\r\neight years, until the sudden death of his father made him a\r\ncountry gentleman, a more or less jolly sailor-man he continued to\r\nbe. And it was during that period--to be exact, three years after\r\nhe ran away and four years before he returned--that, as I have\r\nsaid, at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, he married, after ten days\'\r\ncourtship, Mary Godselle, only daughter of Jean Godselle, saloon\r\nkeeper of that town."\r\n\r\n"That makes him just eighteen," I remarked; "somewhat young for a\r\nbridegroom."\r\n\r\n"But a good deal older than the bride," was Henry\'s comment, "she\r\nbeing at the time a few months over fourteen."\r\n\r\n"Was it legal?" I enquired.\r\n\r\n"Quite legal," answered Henry. "In New Hampshire, it would seem,\r\nthey encourage early marriages. \'Can\'t begin a good thing too\r\nsoon,\' is, I suppose, their motto."\r\n\r\n"How did the marriage turn out?" was my next question. The married\r\nlife of a lady and gentleman, the united ages of whom amounted to\r\nthirty-two, promised interesting developments.\r\n\r\n"Practically speaking," replied Henry, "it wasn\'t a marriage at\r\nall. It had been a secret affair from the beginning, as perhaps\r\nyou can imagine. The old man had other ideas for his daughter, and\r\nwasn\'t the sort of father to be played with. They separated at\r\nthe church door, intending to meet again in the evening. Two\r\nhours later Master Tom Sleight got knocked on the head in a street\r\nbrawl. If a row was to be had anywhere within walking distance he\r\nwas the sort of fellow to be in it. When he came to his senses he\r\nfound himself lying in his bunk, and the \'Susan Pride\'--if that\r\nwas the name of the ship; I think it was--ten miles out to sea.\r\nThe Captain declined to put the vessel about to please either a\r\nloving seaman or a loving seaman\'s wife; and to come to the point,\r\nthe next time Mr. Tom Sleight saw Mrs. Tom Sleight was seven years\r\nlater at the American bar of the Grand Central in Paris; and then\r\nhe didn\'t know her."\r\n\r\n"But what had she been doing all the time?" I queried. "Do you\r\nmean to tell me that she, a married woman, had been content to let\r\nher husband disappear without making any attempt to trace him?"\r\n\r\n"I was making it short," retorted Henry, in an injured tone, "for\r\nyour benefit; if you want to have the whole of it, of course you\r\ncan. He wasn\'t a scamp; he was just a scatterbrain--that was the\r\nworst you could say against him. He tried to communicate with her,\r\nbut never got an answer. Then he wrote to the father, and told him\r\nfrankly the whole story. The letter came back six months later,\r\nmarked--\'Gone away; left no address.\' You see, what had happened\r\nwas this: the old man died suddenly a month or two after the\r\nmarriage, without ever having heard a word about it. The girl\r\nhadn\'t a relative or friend in the town, all her folks being\r\nFrench Canadians. She\'d got her pride, and she\'d got a sense of\r\nhumour not common in a woman. I was with her at the Grand Central\r\nfor over a year, and came to know her pretty well. She didn\'t\r\nchoose to advertise the fact that her husband had run away from\r\nher, as she thought, an hour after he had married her. She knew he\r\nwas a gentleman with rich relatives somewhere in England; and\r\nas the months went by without bringing word or sign of him, she\r\nconcluded he\'d thought the matter over and was ashamed of her.\r\nYou must remember she was merely a child at the time, and hardly\r\nunderstood her position. Maybe later on she would have seen the\r\nnecessity of doing something. But Chance, as it were, saved her\r\nthe trouble; for she had not been serving in the Cafe more than\r\na month when, early one afternoon, in walked her Lord and Master.\r\n\'Mam\'sell Marie,\' as of course we called her over there, was at\r\nthat moment busy talking to two customers, while smiling at a\r\nthird; and our hero, he gave a start the moment he set eyes on\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"You told me that when he saw her there he didn\'t know her," I\r\nreminded Henry.\r\n\r\n"Quite right, sir," replied Henry, "so I did; but he knew a pretty\r\ngirl when he saw one anywhere at any time--he was that sort, and a\r\nprettier, saucier looking young personage than Marie, in spite of\r\nher misfortunes, as I suppose you\'d call \'em, you wouldn\'t have\r\nfound had you searched Paris from the Place de la Bastille to the\r\nArc de Triomphe."\r\n\r\n"Did she," I asked, "know him, or was the forgetfulness mutual?"\r\n\r\n"She recognised him," returned Henry, "before he entered the Cafe,\r\nowing to catching sight of his face through the glass door while\r\nhe was trying to find the handle. Women on some points have better\r\nmemories than men. Added to which, when you come to think of it,\r\nthe game was a bit one-sided. Except that his moustache, maybe,\r\nwas a little more imposing, and that he wore the clothes of a\r\ngentleman in place of those of an able-bodied seaman before the\r\nmast, he was to all intents and purposes the same as when they\r\nparted six years ago outside the church door; while she had\r\nchanged from a child in a short muslin frock and a \'flapper,\' as I\r\nbelieve they call it, tied up in blue ribbon, to a self-possessed\r\nyoung woman in a frock that might have come out of a Bond Street\r\nshow window, and a Japanese coiffure, that being then the fashion.\r\n\r\n"She finished with her French customers, not hurrying herself in\r\nthe least--that wasn\'t her way; and then strolling over to her\r\nhusband, asked him in French what she could have the pleasure of\r\ndoing for him. His education on board the \'Susan Pride\' and\r\nothers had, I take it, gone back rather than forward. He couldn\'t\r\nunderstand her, so she translated it for him into broken English,\r\nwith an accent. He asked her how she knew he was English. She told\r\nhim it was because Englishmen had such pretty moustaches, and came\r\nback with his order, which was rum punch. She kept him waiting\r\nabout a quarter of an hour before she returned with it. He filled\r\nup the time looking into the glass behind him when he thought\r\nnobody was observing him.\r\n\r\n"One American drink, as they used to concoct it in that bar, was\r\ngenerally enough for most of our customers, but he, before he\r\nleft, contrived to put away three; also contriving, during the\r\nsame short space of time, to inform \'Mam\'sel Marie\' that Paris,\r\nsince he had looked into her eyes, had become the only town\r\nworth living in, so far as he was concerned, throughout the whole\r\nuniverse. He had his failings, had Master Tom Sleight, but shyness\r\nwasn\'t one of them. She gave him a smile when he left that would\r\nhave brought a less impressionable young man than he back again to\r\nthat Cafe; but for the rest of the day I noticed \'Mam\'sel Marie\'\r\nfrowned to herself a good deal, and was quite unusually cynical in\r\nher view of things in general.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0183]\r\n\r\n"Next afternoon he found his way to us again, and much the same\r\nsort of thing went on, only a little more of it. A sailor-man, so\r\nI am told, makes love with his hour of departure always before his\r\nmind, and so gets into the habit of not wasting time. He gave her\r\nshort lessons in English, for which she appeared to be grateful,\r\nand she at his request taught him the French for \'You are just\r\ncharming! I love you!\' with which, so he explained, it was his\r\nintention, on his return to England, to surprise his mother. He\r\nturned up again after dinner, and the next day before lunch, when\r\nafter that I looked up and missed him at his usual table, the\r\nfeeling would come to me that business was going down. Marie\r\nalways appeared delighted to see him, and pouted when he left; but\r\nwhat puzzled me at the time was, that though she fooled him to the\r\ntop of his bent, she flirted every bit as much, if not more, with\r\nher other customers--leastways with the nicer ones among them.\r\nThere was one young Frenchman in particular--a good-looking chap,\r\na Monsieur Flammard, son of the painter. Up till then he\'d been\r\nmaking love pretty steadily to Miss Marie, as, indeed, had most\r\nof \'em, without ever getting much forrarder; for hitherto a chat\r\nabout the weather, and a smile that might have meant she was in\r\nlove with you or might have meant she was laughing at you--no man\r\ncould ever tell which,--was all the most persistent had got out\r\nof her. Now, however, and evidently to his own surprise, young\r\nMonsieur Flammard found himself in clover. Provided his English\r\nrival happened to be present and not too far removed, he could\r\nhave as much flirtation as he wanted, which, you may take it,\r\nworked out at a very tolerable amount. Master Tom could sit and\r\nscowl, and for the matter of that did; but as Marie would explain\r\nto him, always with the sweetest of smiles, her business was to be\r\nnice to all her customers, and to this, of course, he had nothing\r\nto reply: that he couldn\'t understand a word of what she and\r\nFlammard talked and laughed about didn\'t seem to make him any the\r\nhappier.\r\n\r\n"Well, this sort of thing went on for perhaps a fortnight, and\r\nthen one morning over our dejeune, when she and I had the Cafe\r\nentirely to ourselves, I took the opportunity of talking to\r\nMam\'sel Marie like a father.\r\n\r\n"She heard me out without a murmur, which showed her sense; for\r\nliking the girl sincerely, I didn\'t mince matters with her, but\r\nspoke plainly for her good. The result was, she told me her story\r\nmuch as I have told it to you.\r\n\r\n"\'It\'s a funny tale,\' says I when she\'d finished, \'though maybe\r\nyou yourself don\'t see the humour of it.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Yes, I do,\' was her answer. \'But there\'s a serious side to it\r\nalso,\' says she, \'and that interests me more.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You\'re sure you\'re not making a mistake?\' I suggested.\r\n\r\n"\'He\'s been in my thoughts too much for me to forget him,\' she\r\nreplied. \'Besides, he\'s told me his name and all about himself.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Not quite all,\' says I.\r\n\r\n"\'No, and that\'s why I feel hard toward him,\' answers she.\r\n\r\n"\'Now you listen to me,\' says I. \'This is a very pretty comedy,\r\nand the way you\'ve played it does you credit up till now. Don\'t\r\nyou run it on too long, and turn it into a problem play.\'\r\n\r\n"\'How d\'ye mean?\' says she.\r\n\r\n"\'A man\'s a man,\' says I; \'anyhow he\'s one. He fell in love with\r\nyou six years ago when you were only a child, and now you\'re a\r\nwoman he\'s fallen in love with you again. If that don\'t convince\r\nyou of his constancy, nothing will. You stop there. Don\'t you try\r\nto find out any more.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I mean to find out one thing, answers she: \'whether he\'s a\r\nman--or a cad.\'\r\n\r\n"\'That\'s a severe remark,\' says I, \'to make about your own\r\nhusband.\'\r\n\r\n"\'What am I to think?\' says she. \'He fooled me into loving him\r\nwhen, as you say, I was only a child. Do you think I haven\'t\r\nsuffered all these years? It\'s the girl that cries her eyes out\r\nfor her lover; we learn to take \'em for what they\'re worth later\r\non.\'\r\n\r\n"\'But he\'s in love with you still,\' I says. I knew what was in her\r\nmind, but I wanted to lead her away from it if I could.\r\n\r\n"\'That\'s a lie,\' says she, \'and you know it.\' She wasn\'t choosing\r\nher words; she was feeling, if you understand. \'He\'s in love with\r\na pretty waitress that he met for the first time a fortnight ago.\'\r\n\r\n"\'That\'s because she reminds him of you,\' I replied, \'or because\r\nyou remind him of her, whichever you prefer. It shows you\'re the\r\nsort of woman he\'ll always be falling in love with.\'\r\n\r\n"She laughed at that, but the next moment she was serious again.\r\n\'A man\'s got to fall out of love before he falls into it again,\'\r\nshe replied. \'I want a man that\'ll stop there. Besides,\' she goes\r\non, \'a woman isn\'t always young and pretty: we\'ve got to remember\r\nthat. We want something else in a husband besides eyes.\'\r\n\r\n"\'You seem to know a lot about it,\' says I.\r\n\r\n"\'I\'ve thought a lot about it,\' says she.\r\n\r\n"\'What sort of husband do you want?\' says I.\r\n\r\n"\'I want a man of honour,\' says she.\r\n\r\n"That was sense. One don\'t often find a girl her age talking it,\r\nbut her life had made her older than she looked. All I could find\r\nto say was that he appeared to be an honest chap, and maybe was\r\none.\r\n\r\n"\'Maybe,\' says she; \'that\'s what I mean to find out. And if you\'ll\r\ndo me a kindness,\' she adds, \'you won\'t mind calling me Marie\r\nLuthier for the future, instead of Godselle. It was my mother\'s\r\nname, and I\'ve a fancy for it.\'\r\n\r\n"Well, there I left her to work out the thing for herself, having\r\ncome to the conclusion she was capable of doing it; and so for\r\nanother couple of weeks I merely watched. There was no doubt\r\nabout his being in love with her. He had entered that Cafe at the\r\nbeginning of the month with as good an opinion of himself as a man\r\ncan conveniently carry without tumbling down and falling over it.\r\nBefore the month was out he would sit with his head between his\r\nhands, evidently wondering why he had been born. I\'ve seen the\r\ngame played before, and I\'ve seen it played since. A waiter has\r\nplenty of opportunities if he only makes use of them; for if it\r\ncomes to a matter of figures, I suppose there\'s more love-making\r\ndone in a month under the electric light of the restaurant than\r\nthe moon sees in a year--leastways, so far as concerns what we\r\ncall the civilised world. I\'ve seen men fooled, from boys without\r\nhair on their faces, to old men without much on their heads. I\'ve\r\nseen it done in a way that was pretty to watch, and I\'ve seen\r\nit done in a manner that has made me feel that given a wig and a\r\npetticoat I could do it better myself. But never have I seen it\r\nneater played than Marie played it on that young man of hers. One\r\nday she would greet him for all the world like a tired child that\r\nat last has found its mother, and the next day respond to him in a\r\nstyle calculated to give you the idea of a small-sized empress\r\nin misfortune compelled to tolerate the familiarities of an\r\nanarchist. One moment she would throw him a pout that said as\r\nclearly as words: \'What a fool you are not to put your arms round\r\nme and kiss me\'; and five minutes later chill him with a laugh\r\nthat as good as told him he must be blind not to see that she was\r\nmerely playing with him. What happened outside the Cafe--for now\r\nand then she would let him meet her of a morning in the Tuileries\r\nand walk down to the Cafe with her, and once or twice had allowed\r\nhim to see her part of the way home--I cannot tell you: I only\r\nknow that before strangers it was her instinct to be reserved. I\r\ntake it that on such occasions his experiences were interesting;\r\nbut whether they left him elated or depressed I doubt if he could\r\nhave told you himself.\r\n\r\n"But all the time Marie herself was just going from bad to worse.\r\nShe had come to the Cafe a light-hearted, sweet-tempered girl;\r\nnow, when she wasn\'t engaged in her play-acting--for that\'s all\r\nit was, I could see plainly enough--she would go about her work\r\nsilent and miserable-looking, or if she spoke at all it would be\r\nto say something bitter. Then one morning after a holiday she had\r\nasked for, and which I had given her without any questions, she\r\ncame to business more like her old self than I had seen her since\r\nthe afternoon Master Tom Sleight had appeared upon the scene. All\r\nthat day she went about smiling to herself; and young Flammard,\r\npresuming a bit too far maybe upon past favours, found himself\r\nsharply snubbed: it was a bit rough on him, the whole thing.\r\n\r\n"\'It\'s come to a head,\' says I to myself; \'he has explained\r\neverything, and has managed to satisfy her. He\'s a cleverer chap\r\nthan I took him for.\'\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t turn up at the Cafe that day, however, at all, and she\r\nnever said a word until closing time, when she asked me to walk\r\npart of the way home with her.\r\n\r\n"\'Well,\' I says, so soon as we had reached a quieter street, \'is\r\nthe comedy over?\'\r\n\r\n"\'No,\' says she, \'so far as I\'m concerned it\'s commenced. To tell\r\nyou the truth, it\'s been a bit too serious up to now to please me.\r\nI\'m only just beginning to enjoy myself,\' and she laughed, quite\r\nher old light-hearted laugh.\r\n\r\n"\'You seem to be a bit more cheerful,\' I says.\r\n\r\n"\'I\'m feeling it,\' says she; \'he\'s not as bad as I thought. We\r\nwent to Versailles yesterday.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Pretty place, Versailles,\' says I; \'paths a bit complicated if\r\nyou don\'t know your way among \'em.\'\r\n\r\n"\'They do wind,\' says she.\r\n\r\n"\'And there he told you that he loved you, and explained\r\neverything?\'\r\n\r\n"\'You\'re quite right,\' says she, \'that\'s just what happened. And\r\nthen he kissed me for the first and last time, and now he\'s on his\r\nway to America.\'\r\n\r\n"\'On his way to America?\' says I, stopping still in the middle of\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n"\'To find his wife,\' she says. \'He\'s pretty well ashamed of\r\nhimself for not having tried to do it before. I gave him one or\r\ntwo hints how to set about it--he\'s not over smart--and I\'ve got\r\nan idea he will discover her.\' She dropped her joking manner,\r\nand gave my arm a little squeeze. She\'d have flirted with her own\r\ngrandfather--that\'s my opinion of her.\r\n\r\n"\'He was really nice,\' she continues. \'I had to keep lecturing\r\nmyself, or I\'d have been sorry for him. He told me it was his love\r\nfor me that had shown him what a wretch he had been. He said\r\nhe knew I didn\'t care for him two straws--and there I didn\'t\r\ncontradict him--and that he respected me all the more for it. I\r\ncan\'t explain to you how he worked it out, but what he meant was\r\nthat I was so good myself that no one but a thoroughly good fellow\r\ncould possibly have any chance with me, and that any other sort\r\nof fellow ought to be ashamed of himself for daring even to be\r\nin love with me, and that he couldn\'t rest until he had proved to\r\nhimself that he was worthy to have loved me, and then he wasn\'t\r\ngoing to love me any more.\'\r\n\r\n"\'It\'s a bit complicated,\' says I. \'I suppose you understood it?\'\r\n\r\n"\'It was perfectly plain,\' says she, somewhat shortly, \'and, as I\r\ntold him, made me really like him for the first time.\'\r\n\r\n"\'It didn\'t occur to him to ask you why you had been flirting like\r\na volcano with a chap you didn\'t like,\' says I.\r\n\r\n"\'He didn\'t refer to it as flirtation,\' says she. \'He regarded it\r\nas kindness to a lonely man in a strange land.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I think you\'ll be all right,\' says I. \'There\'s all the makings\r\nof a good husband in him--seems to be simple-minded enough,\r\nanyhow.\'\r\n\r\n"\'He has a very lovable personality when you once know him,\' says\r\nshe. \'All sailors are apt to be thoughtless.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I should try and break him of it later on,\' says I.\r\n\r\n"\'Besides, she was a bit of a fool herself, going away and leaving\r\nno address,\' adds she; and having reached her turning, we said\r\ngood-night to one another.\r\n\r\n"About a month passed after that without anything happening. For\r\nthe first week Marie was as merry as a kitten, but as the days\r\nwent by, and no sign came, she grew restless and excited. Then one\r\nmorning she came into the Cafe twice as important as she had gone\r\nout the night before, and I could see by her face that her little\r\nventure was panning out successfully. She waited till we had the\r\nCafe to ourselves, which usually happened about mid-day, and then\r\nshe took a letter out of her pocket and showed it me. It was a\r\nnice respectful letter containing sentiments that would have done\r\nhonour to a churchwarden. Thanks to Marie\'s suggestions, for which\r\nhe could never be sufficiently grateful, and which proved her\r\nto be as wise as she was good and beautiful, he had traced Mrs.\r\nSleight, nee Mary Godselle, to Quebec. From Quebec, on the death\r\nof her uncle, she had left to take a situation as waitress in a\r\nNew York hotel, and he was now on his way there to continue his\r\nsearch. The result he would, with Miss Marie\'s permission, write\r\nand inform her. If he obtained happiness he would owe it all to\r\nher. She it was who had shown him his duty; there was a good deal\r\nof it, but that\'s what it meant.\r\n\r\n"A week later came another letter, dated from New York this time.\r\nMary could not be discovered anywhere; her situation she had left\r\njust two years ago, but for what or for where nobody seemed to\r\nknow. What was to be done?\r\n\r\n"Mam\'sel Marie sat down and wrote him by return of post, and wrote\r\nhim somewhat sharply--in broken English. It seemed to her he must\r\nbe strangely lacking in intelligence. Mary, as he knew, spoke\r\nFrench as well as she did English. Such girls--especially such\r\nwaitresses--he might know, were sought after on the Continent.\r\nVery possibly there were agencies in New York whose business it\r\nwas to offer good Continental engagements to such young ladies.\r\nEven she herself had heard of one such--Brathwaite, in West\r\nTwenty-third Street, or maybe Twenty-fourth. She signed her\r\nnew name, Marie Luthier, and added a P.S. to the effect that\r\na right-feeling husband who couldn\'t find his wife would have\r\nwritten in a tone less suggestive of resignation.\r\n\r\n"That helped him considerably, that suggestion of Marie\'s about\r\nthe agent Brathwaite. A fortnight later came a third letter.\r\nWonderful to relate, his wife was actually in Paris, of all places\r\nin the world! She had taken a situation in the Hotel du Louvre.\r\nMaster Tom expected to be in Paris almost as soon as his letter.\r\n\r\n"\'I think I\'ll go round to the Louvre if you can spare me for\r\nquarter of an hour,\' said Marie, \'and see the manager.\'\r\n\r\n"Two days after, at one o\'clock precisely, Mr. Tom Sleight walked\r\ninto the Cafe. He didn\'t look cheerful and he didn\'t look sad.\r\nHe had been to the \'Louvre\'; Mary Godselle had left there about\r\na year ago; but he had obtained her address in Paris, and had\r\nreceived a letter from her that very morning. He showed it to\r\nMarie. It was short, and not well written. She would meet him in\r\nthe Tuileries that evening at seven, by the Diana and the Nymph;\r\nhe would know her by her wearing the onyx brooch he had given her\r\nthe day before their wedding. She mentioned it was onyx, in case\r\nhe had forgotten. He only stopped a few minutes, and both he and\r\nMarie spoke gravely and in low tones. He left a small case in\r\nher hands at parting; he said he hoped she would wear it in\r\nremembrance of one in whose thoughts she would always remain\r\nenshrined. I can\'t tell you what he meant; I only tell you what\r\nhe said. He also gave me a very handsome walking-stick with a gold\r\nhandle--what for, I don\'t know; I take it he felt like that.\r\n\r\n"Marie asked to leave that evening at half-past six. I never saw\r\nher looking prettier. She called me into the office before she\r\nwent. She wanted advice. She had in one hand a beautiful opal\r\nbrooch set in diamonds--it was what he had given her that\r\nmorning--and in her other hand the one of onyx.\r\n\r\n"\'Shall I wear them both?\' asked she, \'or only the one?\' She was\r\nhalf laughing, half crying, already.\r\n\r\n"I thought for a bit. \'I should wear the onyx to-night,\' I said,\r\n\'by itself.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Observations of Henry, by Jerome K.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
