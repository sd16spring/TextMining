VThere is no easy answer to this. It depends on a number of variables including your deck configuration, the matchup, the cards in your sideboard, and occasionally your opponent. Don't be afraid to leave in daze on the draw if you think it will be good. \u000a\u000a\u000aMatch ups where daze is generally bad:\u000a\u000aMiracles - Daze is the first card I board out. Good miracles players will fetch basics and play around daze for the entire game. Bolt for their dome is better here. Force is needed to stop counterbalance as counter/top lock stops you from playing magic.\u000a \u000aStorm - ANT usually doesn't care about FOW much less daze. If you don't have enough cards to bring in here and you have to leave it in I would recommend trading it for cantrips if you get the opportunity. It is very unlikely to matter when they decide to go off. Force is B- but makes the cut.\u000a\u000aElves - Daze stops being relevant very quickly and is very easy for elves to play around. They just have so much mana... Force is good though :)\u000a\u000a\u000aMatchups where daze is generally good:\u000a\u000aDelver - This can go either way depending on your main deck/sideboard. If you are playing stifle here you can rely heavily on daze in this matchup and have a big leg up in the great wasteland war. The grindier you are post sideboard the more you will want to board out daze as it gets worse the longer the game goes. I prefer to stay low to the ground with stifle/waste/daze and save sideboard slots for other matchups. Forces are better if you want to play the grind game(especially if your opponent has stifle and you don't), 1-2 is usually enough though.\u000a\u000aSneak & Show - They play multiple 3-4 cmc must counter spells along with counter magic of their own, enough said.\u000a\u000aReanimator - Like Sneak but faster, daze is worse here but will probably stay in unless your board is heavily skewed towards beating combo and graveyard strategies.\u000a\u000aShardless - Daze/Force isn't a great plan, especially against abrupt decay, but you have to win quick here if you want to win at all so I say leave it in. This is another matchup where stifle shines, if you let them get to three lands they will probably bury you.\u000a\u000aMidrange (Stoneblade, Mentor, BUG) - Here is where I like some number of forces on the draw instead of daze. They usually run more lands than you and their cards are high enough impact that I don't mind having a force or two on the draw.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe biggest advice i can give would be to have a solid sideboard plan against the archetypes you expect to face. Don't be afraid to change it up based on what you see from your opponent. \u000a
p1
aVI'm speaking from the point of view of a RUG Delver player, but they are similar enough so here goes..\u000a\u000aGenerally, I side out 2x Daze when on the draw, unless I'm facing combo where permission is king. Unless my opponent has some serious anti-countering shit, 4x Daze on the play is correct against most anything.\u000a\u000aForce of Will usually is either "shave 1" or "side out all 4", and the latter option is usually against attrition decks, but likely *non-blue* decks. In general, if I'm on the draw and taking out the 2x Dazes, the Forces usually stay in. \u000a\u000aA good non-blue example would be Jund. I'd leave 4x Daze in on the play, 2x Daze on the draw, and side out FoW in games 2 and 3, since they are heavily into 2-for-1 mechanics, so Force can become anti-value, and have a good amount of things in the board to come in that are better value, like Submerge, Rough//Tumble, etc.\u000a\u000aI hope this applies closely enough to Grixis Delver to be relevant for you...
p2
aVYou really don't want daze on the draw ever...fow can stay but it helps if you replace the dazes with other blue cards. Against decks that aren't trying to combo kill you, it can be correct to take out forces on the play; the card disadvantage can hurt if you Mulligan. Dazes are very strong on the play. Basically these two cards are catch-all counters for game one; afterwards you try to replace them with sideboard cards that are more suited to that particular matchup.
p3
aVTo your first sentence: \u000aYou, sir, have apparently never played a Delver-mirror in your entire life. Especially one with Stifle on both sides. \u000aI agree though with your statement that generally Daze and Forces should be taken out whenever you have sideboard cards that do a better job at directly countering the opponent's strategy. HOWEVER if you're playing against Delver I'd recommend leaving in all 4 Dazes on the draw. Together with your Stifles and Lightning Bolts they really dictate the opponent's line of play. 
p4
aVBUG Delver has an extremely complicated manabase. Between Decays, Hymns, Lily and the blue backage, it relies heavily on DRS to work. Since you are on Deathblade, you have your own DRS to work with. Just learn how to win DRS duels, and you will greatly improve the MU (or just StP them). Don't forget to play around Daze and Stifle. \u000a\u000aRiP is good, but it hurts you as well. Try Relic of Progenitus instead - it is often one-sided. \u000a\u000a
p5
aVWhat about the matchup is hard for you?  Are other Delver decks also difficult?  It feels like you should be favored since you're playing a deck that's just a bit slower, with more powerful cards.
p6
aVThe rest of the dever matches are easy for that reason, but for some reason I'm either just really bad at the matchup, or can't being their infinite removal

aVJace gives BUG a lot of troubles.\u000aJust focus in 1 to 1 trades and drop a Jace, that would be your final goal.
p13
aVLingering Souls is great against Delver and Liliana of the Veil. \u000aIn general they can only deal with a Batterskull by getting it off your hand when you have your Stoneforge out, it gets kinda difficult once it hits the board. 
p14
aVSince they don't play Stifle but only Wasteland and Daze getting your basics and getting up to Supreme Verdict might also be a really good option. Though they have Golgari Charm in the board to regenerate, so be wary (not more than 2 though usually and they're good against you anyways). \u000a\u000aAlso True-Name-Nemesis is just a good way to deal with Tarmogoyfs. Rest in Peace shuts pretty much everything down. \u000a\u000aAs you see, Golgari Charm is the MVP against Stoneblade Decks, they don't have more than 2 in the board though so it should be fine. 
p15
aVSome BUG Delver lists run Stifle (at least in my local meta) and play the mana denial game. 
p16
aVThere are two kinds of BUG Delver decks. The more "midrangey" kind that plays Hymn to Tourach and Bayou and the "traditional" version that plays the usual 18 land blue duals only delver manabase. The former plays 4 Stifle usually. It's basically RUG Delver with Decay instead of Bolt and DRS instead of Mongoose.
p17
aVso do you have problems with RUG Delver? Because in my experience Nimble Mongoose is just way scarier since you don't really have answers to it while Bolt hits all your creatures besides TNN, but for only 1 mana compared to 2 from Decay and can just straight-up kill you on a low life total even though you may have stabilized the board. 
p18
aVI feel favored against RUG with BUG. Decay is obviously great because it kills 2/3 of their threats and can't be countered, and DRS makes their mana denial plan a lot worse. RUG also has trouble with Tarmogoyf, while BUG doesn't as much. I also run 3 copies of Bob, so that helps a lot. I've had good success in the matchup.
p19
aVI actually meant the matchup between Deathblade and RUG, not BUG and RUG. I compared because OT complained playing a deck where each creature besides TNN is boltable and where Nimble Mongoose should be super scary because it's a mini-TNN where he can't even bring in RiP because of his own Deathrites and Snapcaster Mages. Against his deck RUG seems just even scarier than BUG with stifle. 
p20
aVGiven that you can nor have Perish nor RiP in the sideboard (both good against BUG btw) I honestly don't know why you would play Deathblade over Esper given that it also has a greedier manabase. DRS is good, but is it really worth it? 
p21
aVcould play path to exile in the board
p22
aVI feel like you need to prioritize the correct things in this matchup.  You are the better midrange deck than they are (even if they are playing the super midrangey version with Liliana) so it is in your best interest to safely develop your manabase, play around Daze, and try and get into the midgame.  Prioritize killing their first threat but don't be afraid to take a few hits from Delver if it allows you time to setup your superior late game.  Deathrite Shaman is amazing because he (a) makes theirs not as good and (b) helps protect you from Wasteland.  True-Name Nemesis is excellent especially against the versions with Lili.  Postboard any kind of small-creature removal that can kill Deathrites and Delvers (Disfigure for example) is good at keeping you alive until you can play True Names and planewalkers.

p29
aVWait why can't we play 4 horseman?
p30
aVNot in delver because you tend not to operate on any lands but in miracles or UW stoneblade you could.  Shocks may be better but it depends on the list.  The 3+ color blade decks can't support enough basics to make battle lands work but it wouldn't be too bad in UW miracles or stoneblade.
p31
aVDelver is also built to operate very low to the ground, so it's pretty common for many variants to work best with only two or three lands. To echo what lordoftheshadows said, UW Stoneblade is probably your safest bet for a tempo style deck that runs a lot of basics- it also let's you use back to basics, which is very good at gaining an advantage over the formats nonbasic heavy lists.
p32
aVWouldn't recommend them in Delver.  You often pick up lands with Daze, and shuffle extras away with Brainstorm + Fetch.\u000a\u000aI haven't tried them, but I would suspect they almost never come in untapped in Delver decks, which is very bad.
p33
aVYeah, delver decks also don't run basics with the exception of UR. All of your lands have to be islands so you can daze, they always have to come in untapped, and you will likely be bouncing some of them.\u000a\u000aDelver is one of the archetypes with the least land flexibility.
p34
aVI think ABU Duals>Shocks>Battles. I wouldn't even play battles in Modern, other than Scapeshift 
p35
aVWhat about in basic heavy Daze decks? Aren't the shocks virtually unplayable there?
p36
aVI would say they are both unplayable there, but battles especialy because delver decks often stay around 3 ish lands, and not often are they basics. The battles will rarely come in untapped unless you VERY AGGRESSIVELY fetch basics, which can give you color problems. 
p37
aVI feel like you would want at least one shock to fetch to come in untapped early, a split between battle/shocks would probably be best for stoneblade. I wouldn't even try delver without duals due to daze and being so constrained on lands.
p38
aVI wouldn't want to touch the battle-lands with a ten-foot pole in Legacy.  Even in a basic-heavy Stoneblade deck I'm almost never fetching duals to round out my color options later in the game, I'm fetching them because I need access to multiple colors from the same land in the first couple of turns. And in that situation, you can't afford to have your lands come in tapped.  Shocklands are a much better substitute, because when you need them untapped, they are, and when you just need to shuffle a Brainstorm or something, you can fetch them tapped.
p39
aVAbsolutely terrible in delver
p40
aVYou're much better off with shocks I believe 
p41
aVFor Stoneblade/Miracles the shocklands are the best choice because theyre fetchable and come untapped on demand. Maybe have one (only one!) battle land to fetch up when you do have the 2 basics in play. The next choice would be checklands/filterlands depending on the build (if you run a ton of double W and double U cards the filter land would be better, but again, only as a one of. Same with checklands, one Glacial Fortress never hurts and protects you against Choke.\u000a\u000aSo, something like 2 Shocks, 1 Battle Land and 1 Glacial Fortress would be an okay but very inferior alternative to 4 Tundras for very obvious reasons, but still better than nothing.\u000a\u000aFor Delver sadly you will need at least one dual to use early game with Daze, but the rest can be filled with shocklands. Battle lands are useless because Delver decks usually run between zero and zero basics.\u000a\u000aSo for example a RUG manabase if you're completely broke would be 1 Trop 1 Volc 2 Breeding Pool and 2 Steam Vents, plus the usual assortment of fetches and 4 Wasteland (don't you dare cut any of them)
p42
aVwould this still be true for a 3 color base if I wanted to go esper/jeskai or for a non dual base just stick to u/w?
p43
aVIt costs you relatively little in terms of playability to splash red into U/W off of a Mountain and a Steam Vents.  And then you get access to Pyroblast, Blood Moon, Wear//Tear, and various other nice options.  Also a third color for Engineered Explosives if you want to play it.  It does mean you really need Tarns and Mesas, though.
p44
aVHmm, it depends on many factors. But having limited access to duals you could use it as an opportunity to build something like a Jeskai/Esper Back to Basics based deck, in either Stoneblade or Miracles flavors. Those decks use a crap ton of basics (and usually only run 2 Tundra anyways) and the battle lands could be more comfortable in such a manabase, although the shocklands will always be better.\u000a\u000aIt's a shame that there are no UR or WR battle lands, as it would make a main UW with R sideboard Miracles/Stoneblade deck very viable. But with a Steam vents you should be fine anyways, fetch it EOT if possible to avoid taking 2 damage.\u000a\u000aThe easiest way would be to just take a Miracles manabase and substitute the duals for the aforementioned land combination.
p45
aVEven more true for 3 color mana base. There's no way you're going to fetch 2 basics and THEN want to fetch a dual with 3 color decks. Shocks work great to make the deck playable right away, don't sweat needing to have all the duals right away.
p46
aVYou might be able to get away with it in Stoneblade, but you generally will want shocks over battle lands. There are going to be times where you need to fetch for a dual, and need to use the mana immediately in the first few turns. \u000a\u000aDelver absolutely not, most Delver lists don't even run basic lands, so they will always come in tapped. Also, the Delver decks run Daze, and picking up a Battle land is just awful. You wouldn't even want to use shocks in Delver because of Daze.
p47
aVI wouldn't run them in anything that plays more than 2 colors.
p48
aVBattles are too slow, as they will almost never come in untapped.  And reemmber that shocks can come in tapped if that is acceptable for the turn.\u000a\u000aShocks with daze are rough, yeah, but honestly that just makes me want to fetch a basic island. Maybe up your fetch count by 1 to compensate, helping ensure that you can fetch an island turn 1 and fetch shocks turns 2 and/or 3
p49
aVThey would be unplayable. You can't pick them up with Daze so it's a no go.
p50
aVActually the battle lands that produce blue like [[Prairie Stream]] are Islands so they work with Daze the same as basic Islands, duals and shocks.

aVFocus on the deathblade list, esper is not the right shell for delver if you ask me. I would add a tropical island in place of 1 wasteland and I definitely think you need a second usea with the amount of black you have. It's the cost of running 4c.
p53
aVugh i don't have the money for one more of either usea/trop... but i guess i'll just play tournaments untili win them, but thank you for the tips. do you think the deck will still kind of work the way it looks like right now?\u000a\u000ai thought so too about the delver list actually.\u000a\u000a/edit: i do have a bayou though!! what should i take out for that? a swamp? or a wasteland?
p54
aVI would take out a wasteland. I see waste as more of a utility land in this deck than a part of the strategy. You save it for problem lands more than mana screw. You want to curve out into jace/tnn etc. and with only 21 lands and a decently high curve, the denial plan almost never works out.\u000a\u000aBayou is also great to trick people into you being on a dif deck. Maybe throw in a creeping tar pit for the second usea.\u000a\u000aThis is a recent list of mine for reference. I've since taken out a ts and abrupt d for the 4th ponder and jace main, moving the ts to the board.\u000a\u000ahttp://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/4c-deathblade-3/
p55
aVwhat should i take out for the tar pit, an island? thank you for your input, i think you're right aboiut the denial plan not really being our plan A!
p56
aVI've played a bunch of UWR Delver.  \u000a\u000a1) It's good at beating other Delver decks.  Jitte is really strong, Batterskull is really strong.  It's bad at beating Miracles (possibly the worst Delver variant for that plan).  Many of its matchups feel like 50/50.\u000a\u000a2) TNN is WAY better than Clique, although you can still play a Clique in the side.  If you land one, it drastically cuts down on your opponent's ways to deal with your threat.  Often feels like at that point that only have half a dozen cards that matter for the rest of the game if they can't race you.\u000a\u000a3) I like Stifle in the list.  I think from that main I'd cut 2 Plow and 2 of Snare/Pierce for them.  If you play Stifle, you definitely want the full four Wastelands.  Snare is a meta call.  It's good if there are a bunch of decks that really lean on two-drops.\u000a\u000a4) I don't love Tutor, but you can probably make it work.  I think Needle is probably better than Revoker (less mana, hit by fewer removal spells).  You really want Flusterstorm for combo matchups, it's a much better SB card than Pierce or the third Pyroblast since you don't have THAT much room for countermagic anyways.  You can even run them main if you're expecting a bunch of Storm.  RiP > Cage.  I haven't found the difference in mana cost to be a major issue, but RiP is one of your only ways to try to beat something like Lands.\u000a\u000a5) In the UWR shell it's probably just worse than Stoneforge Mystic.  If you want to play Pyromancer in a Delver deck, Grixis or UR both take advantage of it better.\u000a\u000aAlso, regarding your lands: Karakas could be a reasonable choice.  Less that four Wastelands is not great.  Basics are not great unless you're running Moon (which isn't actually a terrible call).  Basic Mountain feels like hot garbage, especially.  Plateau is pretty bad, you really need all of your duals to make blue.  My typical manabase for the deck is:\u000a\u000a4 Wasteland  \u000a4 Volc (I want seven duals and don't have a fourth Tundra)  \u000a3 Tundra  \u000a9 fetches\u000a\u000aThe seventh dual could be a Karakas, a basic Island, or something else although I'd like it to make colored mana.  If I were running Moon, I'd probably play something like:\u000a\u000a4 Wasteland  \u000a1 Island  \u000a1 Plains  \u000a3 Tundra  \u000a2 Volc  \u000a9 Fetches\u000a\u000aOr I could shave a Wasteland, not run the Stifles, and play a third Island so all of my (nonred) spells are castable off of basics.
p57
aVAppreciate the quick and awesome response. Seems like the snap choice here is to -1 mountain +1 wasteland if anything. The reason it was originally constructed that way was to play around obvious land hate, but maybe i'm being too paranoid about it. I really like swords at 4 since it hits alot of things that bolt can't, looking at you [[Gurmag angler]]. Definately can see [[spell snare]] coming out for [[stifle]] if anything.
p58
aVIf you're playing Delver, you really don't want to be playing Swords.  I was playing three or four originally and have dropped down to two in recent iterations.  Haven't missed it a lot.  True-Name can obviate the need for hard removal if your opponent isn't going too wide.  If you really want the removal you could also try Dismember - unlike other Delver variants, it's easier for this one to get its life total back up.
p59
aV^^This. A huge upside for UWR Delver as that Jitte and Batterskull can really pad your life total. Dismember is a risky play in other Delver builds, but you can definitely afford to pay some life to kill a resolved Goyf or Angler. It's also totally possible to splash one U-Sea for SB hand disruption (not necessary, but I've definitely seen it), and that U-Sea can make your Dismembers hurt even less.
p60
aVI'm really not seeing the added benefits of dismember here over swords. They both have the same cmc 1, instead dismember reads "pay 4 life, target creatures gets -5 -5 till eot" where as i can pay 1 white, exile said creature, and opp gets some life to compliment his loss. Swords also has the added benefit of hitting alot more things that dismember can't, especially after a playtesting gauntlet i participated in last night at my lgs. Matched up against BU reanimator, Grixis Delver, Burn, and 4c Loam. Swords was too good against reanimator and the prevalence of that deck alone in the meta only reinforces the need for swords main. Also, protection isn't even relevant here since the only creature that does so is True Name or Mom. I can also Swords my own creatures in a pinch for a squeeze of life if needed.\u000a\u000aTL;DR\u000a\u000aSwords is better than dismember IMHO for a variety of reasons inc. no life loss, more available targets, and higher utility in general.

aVI've been playing UWR Delver for a while now so I hope that I can give you a few insights based on what i think of the deck.\u000a\u000a1.  I still play this as my main deck so of course I am going to say it is viable in the meta.  It might not be the best delver deck but it is a good deck against other creature decks and the white splash gives you some good sideboard cards.  The deck can feel kinda clunky at times but as long as you enjoy the deck and are willing to put the time and effort into it, it can go toe to toe with just about any other deck.\u000a\u000a2.  I run 2 main deck TNN and a sideboard Clique and I think the protection is huge.  It is almost unstoppable when you can equip it with a batterskull, sword or jitte and will really gum up the board when you need it to.\u000a\u000a3. I am going to combine 3 and 4 because these are cards that I would think about as flex spot cards.  The core of the deck is about 56 or so cards that are pretty stock and the remaining is up to what you want.  I've toyed with running stifles before but feel like RUG does it better so I decided just to run an extra Pierce and 2 gitaxian probes.  I think they are both good cards and don't think they are horrible main deck.\u000a\u000a5. I see you have no Meddling Mages in your sideboard.  I run 3 of them and feel like it is one of the most important cards in the deck that I will always try to find a reason to side in.  It can be great against Shardless (I have named ancestral visions multiple times) miracles in shutting of terminus or swords and storm for naming Infernal Tutor.  When you have 4 color delver decks that are splashing white in the sideboard to play this card, you know its good.  other than that I would split between REB and Pyroblast for cards like cabal therapy and Surgical Extraction and maybe cut the COP since burn isn't that bad of a match up.\u000a\u000a6.  I don't think this is a pyromancer deck honestly.  As has been pointed out, some of the other deck are a better shell for it.\u000a\u000a
p63
aV1. Definately agree here, this deck has the potential clock of a Delver variant with the added stability of a Stoneblade deck in the later turns. I find this mix highly attractive, since id either play one or the other. \u000a\u000a2. How is that Clique in the side working out for you? What does it come in against? How strong is it once it does come in and hit the field?\u000a\u000a3. I tend to agree with your understanding, which is why it was something i wanted to discuss. Its a dirty play to stifle them T1 then T2 Mystic or Delver, but its really strong against almost any deck. However the potential to top deck this late is pretty worrisome to me since you HAVE to run 4. I was given the suggestion last night to -2 lightning bolt -2 spell snare for the stifle package. Whats your opinion on this?\u000a\u000a4. Ill have to give her a try since i can admit i have almost no play time with this card in the deck. Can definately see it shoring up the rather tense combo matchups i find in my meta. COPR is a meta call in my area, since one of my good friends plays Burn. Ill take the advice on the Pyro/REB split though.\u000a\u000a
p64
aVI really like Clique in the sideboard.  There are some matchups (like combo) where TNN does little to nothing and while Clique is a 3 drop, it's still nice to have some interaction.  Otherwise I like it in matchups where games go longer, get grindy and I could really use the extra creature or evasive threat.  \u000a\u000aFor stifle, I would suggest moving a StP to the sideboard, and cutting the spell snares.  Lightning bolt just gives so much reach where you need to close out a game but you can't push through that last damage or when you really need to get a planeswalker off the board.  Stifle is one of those great cards when you can get it to work but is terrible when it doesn't.  \u000a\u000aI would definitely add meddling mages.  It's a card like cabal therapy in that the more that you play with it, the better it becomes and if all else fails just name the card that you are the most afraid of.  Usually I have to talk myself out of sideboarding it in because it can do so much work by cutting off a decks key card.  For burn, at GPSeaTac I played against it 3 times and went 2-1.  I felt the key was landing a batterskull and making sure you have a counterspell for the fireblast or smash to smithereens.
p65
aVI agree on the bolts, its been relevant enough where that bolt off the top spells game or helps keep me alive a bit longer by hitting a opposing delver. Ill have to consider Stifle some more, i love the card but im still on the fence about its inclusion. Ill have to play test it heavily i suppose. And yea burn feels like an iffy matchup always. Very tense for me since i know i gotta go 0-100 with my delver and bolts, or aggressively protect a t2 SFM till i can drop the Big Daddy. Even then protection might get burned out and he ends up blowing 2 cards to get rid of it.
p66
aVAfter you try it out let me know how it works.  I had thought about running stifle after the TC ban and before switching to Dig, but would like to know if it's better than probe.  It's also refreshing to see a little discussion on this deck since it fell of the map so hard from a year ago.  I think I have only run into 2 other people playing UWr Delver in the past year and didn't get to talk to them much about the deck.
p67
aVIll be sure to post here after some play with it. It would be nice if we could keep this thread relevant and source some great info and tech off eachother. Yea i have the pleasure of a guy at my LGS who mained this for a while, so it affords some quality discussion. But a million heads are better than 2.
p68
aVOoooo yay,  UWR Delver! Really excited to see people interested in this deck! I\u2019ve been playing this deck forever, and I plan to play it at the upcoming Open in Philly. Here is my current updated list if you\u2019re interested:\u000a\u000aLegacy UWR Delver.dec, Built with Decked Builder\u000ahttp://decks.deckedbuilder.com/d/163385\u000a\u000aFigure I\u2019ll try to answer your questions with the experience I\u2019ve had with it. Some of the points are just personal preference and may not necessarily be optimal. Hope this helps! \u000a\u000a1.	For viability in the meta I believe this deck is in a fine position. In no way is it the best delver deck to be playing in an open meta, but the deck is playing a lot of powerful cards and you still have the Delver, Daze, Force, Wasteland, Brainstorm, and ponder package that every other delver deck has. You could be doing much worse. For my personal meta this is actually the best delver variant to be playing (Not that I would play another deck if the meta was different haha) as there is a ton of Death and Taxes and Lands. Those are both terrible match-ups for delver. Now I actually believe the Death and Taxes Vs. UWR Delver match-up is pretty close to 50/50 as they can\u2019t really beat True-name/Jitte, especially game 1, but your deck can still fold to Vial or Thalia. Anyway, I think because of this decks adaptive gameplan it has the merits to beat any deck. Just know that there will be match-ups where you draw the wrong half of your deck (Such as a ton of bolts/swords against combo) and lose. \u000a\u000a2.	In my list I currently have 0 copies of Vendilion Clique and 2 main-deck True-name, with 1 in the sideboard. I think True-names ability is very powerful in a lot of match-ups and works so well with stoneforge mystic. Obviously Clique is great with equipment too, but it\u2019s very fragile, and the deck doesn\u2019t have a ton of threats. Having threats that most decks can\u2019t kill is where you want to be. Another huge reason I don\u2019t have clique is I think Meddling Mage does most of the disrupting after board, but I will get more into Mage for the sideboard discussion.\u000a \u000a3.	I think stifle is a sweet card, but I don\u2019t think it should be played in this deck. The reason rug/grixis delver can play this card is because they have a much easier time holding it up. This version of delver doesn\u2019t always have the luxury of holding up extra mana for stifle as we are only running  4 1-mana threats, and we have to tap out a lot of the time for stoneforge multiple turns in a row to both cast and activate. Rug delver gets to play nimble mongoose allowing them more cheap threats, which will allow them extra mana to leave up for stifle. Same thing goes for Grixis delver. They run deathrite as another 1-mana threat. Also deathrite just gives them extra mana itself to cast stifle. Also the card can just be underwhelming a lot of the time. Loses a lot of its utility in the mid-late game, which you will have to resort to a lot of the times.\u000a\u000a4.	I agree with you about this card being too narrow. I think spell pierce is just better. Sure it can be hard to hold up like stifle,  but I think the card is too strong not to play. It has always had merit in a ton of match-ups playing the deck .\u000a\u000a5.	Meddling Mage. I don\u2019t ever see myself playing less than 3 of this card in my sideboard, but I\u2019m almost always jamming 4. This card is so good and is a huge draw to playing this deck. I think this is the best possible meddling mage deck. It works so well with the tempo/midrange aspects of the deck and it is good in so many match-ups. It\u2019s a cheap disruptive threat that we can suit up with equipment. A Meddling Mage with a sword of feast and famine against any combo deck is just insane. I have 3 maindeck probes in my list that go really well with meddling mage. Most of the other sideboard cards are pretty obvious. I guess rest in peace is worth talking about as this card is another huge draw for me to play the deck. This is the best possible graveyard hate card to play, and we get to utilize it with absolutely no drawback. This helps a ton in the life from the loam match-ups. Making those match-ups actually winnable. I think lands is one of if not the worst match-up for this deck/every delver deck. Saying that I have never lost to the deck thanks to meddling mage, true-name, and rest in peace. I\u2019m sure that will change eventually. \u000a\u000a6.	This is not a pyro deck. If you want to play pyro grixis is by far the best shell. The triple threat of pyro/probe/cabal therapy is just too strong. \u000a\u000aSorry for any rambling, but I would love to discuss this deck with you further if you have any questions.\u000a
p69
aVInteresting take on the build. How do the 3 mb Git probes suit you? Im curious the the extra draw fairs? Im getting kinda hyped here lol thinking about -2 spell snare +1 wear/tear +1 spell pierce out of the board and making room for +2 meddling mage into the board.
p70
aVI love Snapcaster Mage, does it make sense to include a few copies?
p71
aVIts worth testing at the very least, though i feel snapcaster fits stronger into the pure stoneblade shell than the hybrid this list seeks to create. He might fit a nich where the recurrence might be valuable, but i dont think its necessary and is overly redundant.\u000a\u000aIf i were to try him out, it would be at 2 and my changes would be -1StP and - Lightning bolt. Sleeve it up and do some testing, report back to us with your results. Id really like to see this thread develop with multiple testers all trying new ideas and reporting in, since it benefits us all!
p72
aV1. The deck is fine in almost any metagame. However 3 basics seem to much to me. I play one Island because I hate losing to t1 wasteland. Spell snare is probably a meta call as I don't play them at all.\u000a\u000a2. My list plays 2 TNNs and no Clique at all. (I would consider one if there are more Miracles players around, but TNN is probably even better)\u000a\u000a3. Stifle is a card that I sneak into my deck to surprise people sometimes. But the deck seems better without.\u000a\u000a4. Meddling Mage is an all star in this deck. Always play 3-4. Enlightened tutor seems too slow. Would you rather play t1 Delver into t2 (insert any cmc2 hate card) or play t1 tutor into t2 hate card (If you draw your second land and you won't)? \u000a\u000a5. I've tried Young Pyromancer but it doesn't have any synergy with your Stoneforge Mystic/TNN plan so I dropped him.\u000a\u000aSorry for the bad formating, I'm on my phone right now. If you have any further questions feel free to ask.
p73
aVIve dropped the mountain here for the 4th Wasteland. Unfortunately 4c Loam is a thing where i play so i need the 2 atleast. Regarding the Etutor board, the ideology behind it is that i can side in the 3 tutors + hate card and have an effective 4 copies of said hate card, and most are cheap enough that we can Etutor drop hate t3 while still maintaining a proactive gameplan t1 and t2.
p74
aVYou could get by with one volc. It's not ideal but it's better than nothing. I' we had success with only 3 volcs in my ur delver builds as well. \u000a\u000aUr delver is a great entry to the format. Have fun! 
p75
aVI guess you mean with Steam Vents as substitute? Because only playing 3 Mountains (1volc 2 mountains) with 2 Fireblast and a lot of ways to find them seems really weird. 
p76
aVSorry for the confusion I thought his question was if he could get by with one volc and steam vents and was agreeing he could. wasteland decks won't be fun to play against especially once they figure out you have shocks. Since fireblast is the finisher you generally won't care that the shock is entering tapped to preserve a bit of life and stay out of bolt range. \u000a\u000aDaze is the only real problem I see with the shock idea. Although casting brainstorm in response to a wasteland activation and dazing yourself to save the land is pretty fun. 
p77
aVHi! I've been playing with this deck at my local lgs and it's awesome! I'm playing a very similar list, with +2 ponders, -2 CLs.  The 18 lands in my opinion are pretty necessary. You want to be able to curve out, drop dudes, and be able to follow up with multiple spells. also, Fireblast is an all-star in the deck. This card allows for turn 3 wins with a combination of it and multiple prowess triggers. \u000ahere is my current iteration:\u000a3 Bloodstained Mire\u000a2 Island\u000a2 Mountain\u000a3 Polluted Delta\u000a4 Scalding Tarn\u000a4 Volcanic Island\u000a4 Brainstorm\u000a2 Chain Lightning\u000a4 Daze\u000a4 Delver of Secrets\u000a2 Fireblast\u000a4 Force of Will\u000a4 Gitaxian Probe\u000a4 Lightning Bolt\u000a4 Monastery Swiftspear\u000a4 Ponder\u000a2 Price of Progress\u000a4 Stormchaser Mage\u000aSideboard:\u000a\u000a2 Exquisite Firecraft\u000a2 Flusterstorm\u000a1 Grim Lavamancer\u000a1 Pithing Needle\u000a2 Pyroblast\u000a2 Smash to Smithereens\u000a2 Submerge\u000a1 Sulfuric Vortex\u000a2 Surgical Extraction\u000a
p78
aVLooks pretty sweet, but im not sure it is doing anything that UR Delver isnt already doing.  Stormchaser instead of Pyromancer might not add a whole lot, but maybe i'm undervaluing the evasion too much.\u000a\u000aI think you want to take a page from UR Delver and drop to 16 lands and +2 Ponders.
p79
aVI disagree in that stormchaser doesnt add anything special.  Peezy is a long game card, that takes multiple turns to make offensive. Stormchaser can get in for 4-6 uncblockable damage the first two turns it enters play, which is incredible in this sort of deck.especially in multiples.
p80
aVI'm testing a similar build right now to some success. \u000a\u000aIt feels really smooth and the evasion that storm chaser provides has been good. It can be very explosive. I have found no need for 18 lands. I think you can easily get by with 15-16. I also don't play fireblast. But I don't hate it in the list. \u000a\u000aThat gives me access to 2 more ponder and a grim lavamancer. Lavamancer is very good in this deck. Eidolon out of the board is a house. And I really like blood moon in this shell as well. \u000a\u000aIt's definitely a good option as a starter deck that gives you flexibility if you want to play other delver variants in the future. 
p81
aVI don't know about Blood Moon in a deck that plays Price of Progress I'd rather have more of those in the SB. \u000a\u000aGo out there kid, show the Lands players out there what you're made of! 
p82
aVI don't understand your comment. Blood moon makes non-basic lands into non-basic mountains... PoP will still work if that is your concern.\u000a\u000aEdit: If you think you just don't need/like it and want to go more linear on the burn plan that is totally reasonable. It's just another tool we have access to.\u000a\u000aThe difference is that blood moon is one card combo in that it can just end a game on the spot. Where PoP is more like a finisher. both are good an reasonable.
p83
aVOh wow, shame on me. I played against it so often but never realized it (propably because Wasteland doesn't work). But yeah now you say it I know that legendary lands still have their rule even under a Blood Moon. \u000a\u000aStill, thinking about the decks you'd want it in (BUG, Lands, 4c-loam) Price would be better as a finisher imo. I disagree with bringing BM in against other Delver decks, so both BM am PoP would only be "ok" against these decks. \u000aI mean, PoP has just the upside of fitting right into the game plan, flipping Delver etc. \u000a\u000aAnyways, thanks for pointing out! 
p84
aVNo worries. Wasteland doesn't work because wasteland itself would be a mountain. Pop definitely fits better in terms of the decks overall game plan. I was simply suggesting moon out of the board in addition to pop, not in its stead. \u000a\u000a\u000aWhether you want both or not it's purely a meta call. I play in a small local meta that has 2 cloudpost players as well at 1-2 lands players. I'm still running 2 pops main and one in the board. 
p85
aVFireblast works fine with Steam Vents, and I definitely think it's playable with only 1 dual.
p86
aVI agree with only having 16 lands since Ponder is also just a good turn 1 play that can either find you a second land or get you a smooth next draws. \u000aFrom back in my days I have the experience that 3 Volcanics is enough, you also don't really need 4 for like any other Legacy deck, even Sneak&Show only plays 3. \u000aSo I'd cut a Volcanic and a Fetchland. You can just get 1-2 Volcanics and 1-2 Steam Vents, the difference between 0 to 1 Volcanic heavily outweights the impact on any further Volcanics you'll add. \u000aJust saying because with the current price hype of duals regarding EMA I'd rather wait a while until the dust has settled. 
p87
aVForce of Will is not "free" no matter what anyone tells you. It costs cards and life.\u000a\u000aDaze, on the other hand, is actually free.
p88
aVDaze costs tempo. It isn't free.
p89
aV10% of the deck costs more than 1 mana. There's no downside.
p90
aVEver played a Delver mirror where your opponent is on Daze, Wasteland and Stifle? The tempo-loss from Daze is definitely not free, especially when you want to cast e.g. a Stormchaser Mage around Daze. \u000a\u000aDon't get me wrong, Daze is great and against Delver I never board any of them out (I play Stifle and Wasteland, too though so I wouldn't recommend it for this build on the draw). 
p91
aVWhen one steps back and looks at UWR Delver beyond its questionable deck construction philosophies, it's actually really good against the top tier decks at the moment, other than Miracles. (E.g. Other delver decks, Shardless, DnT, ANT, S&T, Elves, and is the best Delver variant against Lands)
p92
aVSaying something is the best delver variant against lands is a little like saying someone is the least crooked man in the mob or the least gay village person. Still, as a lands player I would actually say the really burny UR lists are actually probably best vs me, because the mana denial plan works worst against them and even if I deal with their creatures they can often burn me out, plus SB price of progress which someone in my group running UR would play is an absolute blowout. 
p93
aVI was playing UR Delver with 4x Price in the main last night.  Didn't do much for my Burn matchup, but was nice against the other decks I played when it came up.
p94
aVYeah, about that miracles matchup.  I lose game 1 in 7 minutes. I win game 2 in 35 minutes, I lose game 3 in 5 minutes.  That's what sucks about that.\u000a\u000aWith eternal masters and except for the dual lands I will have the whole thing foiled. So I really want this deck to be a thing, but even I know with 3+ years piloting experience, you can't win 7 out of 9 matches in a GP (but 6...) and its tuff to take a 5 rounder with it.  I've had greater success with Shardless because of a card called Abrupt Decay...
p95
aVI was thinking about this last night, and it honestly it's probably better as just a straight up Jeskai stoneblade deck rather than with delver.
p96
aVI can give a more in depth response later, but the main advantage that delver has over a slower blade deck is the ability to stretch the opponent's removal.\u000a\u000aIt's easy to remove a SFM when it's the only threat presented to you. It's much harder when there's a Delver clocking you, especially while being threatened by Daze and Wasteland.\u000a\u000aIf RUG Delver is a Ferrari, UWR is a freight train.
p97
aVand its much harder to clock someone when you've given them two timewalks StP'ing something 3 or 4 turns ago.
p98
aVOk I mean that's one of the reasons I loved the deck was because the mana base is so flexible it allows me to swap to something else within those colors, miracles, stone blade, sneak and show, ur delver, etc. \u000a\u000a\u000aPart of me is curious to see the rest of the spoilers from EM. Because over time I'll probably build miracles, for some reason I gravitate to Grindy decks across every format. During GP NJ almost all my matches went to time. That was draining as hell, that being said if I'm gonna play grinding wouldn't miracles be the go to?\u000a\u000a\u000aAlso is the source's list for stoneblade up to date?
p99
aVyeah, I drained my vacay fund at work and am thinking about grabbing a couple of duals. I have Trops and Volcs and can't decide if I want to grab Undergrounds or Tundras (I currently only have Temur Delver)
p100
aVIf you're a lifetime Delver player, it's definitely the Seas imo. Since you already have the Volcanic Islands and the Tropical Islands, getting Seas would let you transition easily from RUG to BUG and Grixis/4color.
p101
aVHaha I wouldn't say lifetime but yeah I've been playing for 2 or 3 years.
p102
aVDefinitely the Seas then. Like you, I played RUG for a really long time until I got my Seas and started playing Team America. I still sleeve up the geese sometimes for smaller locals, though. \u000a\u000aIf you're anything like me, you'll never play Miracles even if it is the #1 deck in the format heh. 
p103
aVPersonally I'd grab the seas. Worse cast it's easier to turn seas into tundras plus trade or cash. Than the opposite 
p104
aVYeah that's what I'm leaning towards as well. It's easier to transition from temur delver to Grixis delver as well.
p105
aV[This](http://www.mtgthesource.com/forums/showthread.php?21441-Deck-Blade-Control&p=913354&viewfull=1#post913354) is the most recently posted UWr list on the thread.  I have the build I used earlier in the thread, but I haven't touched stoneblade in months so..\u000a\u000aIt's pretty rough as a UWr player when most of the discussion is Esper, I've taken to mostly lurking in the Miracles thread to see if I can't apply some of their tech.
p106
aVI played it and every hand was usually 1-2 lands, 1-2 cantrip, removal spell, stoneforge + daze, and it felt fucking awful.\u000a\u000aThat said, you get to play Meddling Mage and Red Blast in the sb and True Name + Equipment, so it's not all bad. It's just not very good at playing a tempo game. \u000a\u000aAs /u/KangaRod said, you're probably better off playing it as a UWR Blade deck rather than a Delver deck. 
p107
aVI think what I might do is rebuild into stoneblade and gradually build into miracles depending on the EM spoilers 
p108
aVI played UWR Delver at my local weekly and did well this week (4-0). It can be a metagame deck (and I think it's in a good place right now) but it's not going to be a high tier deck unless more cards are printed for it.\u000a\u000aI think 4c Delver is the most reliable delver deck right now and it has done the best of withstanding metagame changes since it became a deck in FRF.
p109
aVThe main problem for this matchup (in my opinion) is the approach Delver decks take to any given field: Delver decks are for the most part designed to fight other blue decks, combo decks in particular. The tempo plan of Stifle/Wasteland/Daze is effective much of the time vs. fair decks, but if e.g. Stoneblade develops their mana, Delver strategies can have a hard time keeping up.\u000a\u000aThis is essentially what's happening in the Eldrazi matchup. Their lands tap for multiple mana, which diminishes the value of cards like Daze and Spell Pierce, and Eye of Ugin reduces the cost of their creatures, making you more reliant of Force of Will to stop their threats, which is card disadvantage. I haven't seen an Eldrazi list that runs fetchlands, so Stifle can't really stop their mana. \u000a\u000aFurthermore, Abrupt Decay is pretty weak against the deck (but typically necessary for Chalice and Trinisphere), and Lighting Bolt can't kill Thought-Knot Seer or Reality Smasher.\u000a\u000aAll this makes Wasteland much more important than it is vs. other decks. What you could do is include in your sideboard something like Crucible of Worlds or Life from the Loam.\u000a\u000aI suspect you also want stronger removal spells to handle their board. (Dismember and Murderous Cut come to mind.) \u000a\u000aOne idea I've been toying with for the sideboard is bounce spells. Combining bounce and recursive mana denial might be a way to stall the deck long enough for a Delver or Tarmogoyf to either finish the opponent or get them into Lightning Bolt range. (Note: this is pure speculation.)
p110
aVE.Stompy player here (but I've also played heaps of RUG Delver), these are my thoughts so far. Basically, the Delver/Wasteland draws are your best draws, and capitalising on our fragile mana base is most important. Forcing us to have few lands and only able to deploy small threats that can be eaten by Goyf will usually allow you to get there. Abrupt Decay is also very helpful in dealing with Chalice, so it's nice you have that main. That being said, you will have a lot of dead cards and throwing these at any opportunity is important. Daze anything (esp. Chalice if you're lucky) since it'll often be difficult for them to pay as the deck taps out very frequently and of course Force/BS away your Pierces and Stifles (though you can Stifle TKS trigger, kind of sweet) because if they don't hit a Chalice then they're basically useless. I don't think Pyro is amazing since he gets dwarfed quickly and Smasher doesn't care about chump blockers, so more Anglers or Goyfs are good.\u000a\u000aFrom SB Loam is great (E.Stompy can't beat Wastelock), Therapy is very good, since the deck doesn't empty its hand fast at times and you can tag a Seer or Smasher, Dismember is good of course and maybe some more hard removal (Murderous Cut, even Terminate) is something you can look into.\u000a\u000aBut yeah, get on the board quickly with a Delver (fliers are super hard to deal with for E.Stompy too), make sure Chalice is off the table via Decay/Force/Daze and then just dig for Wastelands and more beatsticks - you have tools, just refining these and digging for them will let you get there. :)
p111
aVI play Grixis Delver so take my thoughts with that in mind:\u000a\u000aYour best plan of attack is a T1 delver. Daze anything you can as they can quickly build up lots of mana, making Daze a dead draw by T3+. Deathrite is another great play because it helps ramp you passed Thorn (usually in the sb) and Trinisphere, should one resolve. Pyromancer tokens don't do much against Smasher, but they are great at chumping Thought-Knot and large Endless Ones (ex: I was able to hold back a 7/7 Endless One for 3 turns while my flipped delver crashed in). \u000a\u000aBolt Mimics ASAP; this will stop some of the explosiveness of the deck. Also, Bolt doesn't hit Thought-Knot or Smasher so unless you're hitting a small Endless One or something, they are stuck going to the dome. \u000a\u000aWasteland is obviously huge and you should prioritize hands that have it.\u000a\u000aHaving access to Cabal Therapy + Probe for game 2+ is really great. Getting rid of their prison pieces and/or smashers really slows them down and allows you to develop your board. Bonus points if you can Surgical these cards after Therapy ;) \u000a\u000aI went 2-0 against the colorless Eldrazi deck at my weekly on Tuesday. You have the tools to fight through it, just prioritize keeping hands that have those tools.
