aS'Great video ! My compliments. I had a boxer (bitch - in the good sense !) \nmyself for many years and it was one of the best things that ever happened \nto our family. When we got her as a puppy, we had 3 children aged between \n12 and 18. They kinda grew up together and had a great deal of fun. The dog \nnever showed her teeth to the children or any visitor, known or unknown. \nLater on, we welcomed our grandchildren and the dog was very protective \ntowards them, but we NEVER EVER left the children or grandchildren alone \nwith the dog. How cute and loving it might be (or seem), it\'s still a dog \nand caracters can change over the years. By the time the dog became 8 or 9 \nyears old, I had to be very carefull with her when she was around children \nother than our own or our grandchildren. On several occasions she showed \nher teeth and stopped wiggling her (short) tail. \nYes ! They are great company for children and will stay "clownish" for many \nyears when well and friendly treated, but I still think it\'s not a good \nidea to leave them alone with children.\nThere was this story on the media, many years ago in Belgium, as where a \ntoddler STAPLED (with a Bostich handstapler) the ears of the family \nlabrador 21 (twenty one) times. The kid got bitten when it tried to get the \n22nd staple in the dog\'s ear and suffered severy face injuries. I mean, a \ndog can be very nice and forgiving, but there is always an end to its \npatience.\nAgain, Linus is the speaking image of my own boxer, but please, be carefull \n!'

aS'A child\'s Mother, Father or anyone can drop him or her. Does that make \nthose people bad. Dogs are a lot smarter than you think and have better \ninstincts.\nI\'ve seen Mothers tell their child to do something THEY Know is wrong. For \nno other reason than to start trouble. In this Video, I see a Dog watching \nover his new Child, trying to keep the child from wandering to far from Mom.\nDon\'t give me that "Could Have or Might Have" Bull-Ends. If your afraid of \ndogs or just don\'t like them, that\'s on you. We\'ve had EIGHT Rescued dogs \nin our house at the same time. When friends and their children cam over, we \nnever had to worry.\nHave you ever seen a 76 pound dog play Hide and Seek with kids? The dog \nloved being "IT" and the kids had a great time.\nHow many kids were abandoned in Russia and raised by abandoned dogs. LOOK \nIT UP. It\'s under "Feral Children".'

aS'I dont think the cat has been abused, but she is showing her aggression \nthrough dominance. I have a kitten who does this to my partner so I know \nabuse when I see it.'

p997
aS"Why the FUCK are you terrorizing her at all ?????? If you know she doesn't \nlike men, what are you doing with her ? Seriously - you're a sorry asshole. \nIs it hurting your ass at all if she needs to have a better home , or one \nwhere she feels safe ? You're actually ass-hurt over the fact this poor \ncreature is in torment ? GO TO HELL."

aS"Just leave the cat alone and stop chasing it you stupid moron. Perhaps the \ncat was adopted and in the previous family it had been abused. This video \nshows why cats usually don't get along with boyfriends. The boyfriend \nsecretly harasses the cat causing it to show bad behavior."
p1002
aS'+Audrey Beeler \nYou are right. The video only shows how stupid and fucked up the asshole \nwith the camera is, not the cat. The cat needs protection.'
p1003
aS'Yes it looks like this stupid child has nothing better to do with his time \nthan to punish this poor cat. Why are you doing this to this cat? I think \nyou need the same thing done to you! Only then will you stop! Your \nignorance is outrageous!'
