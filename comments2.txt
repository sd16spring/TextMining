Its small led lights \nattached to wire and you feed it through the spokes.

aS'+Isak Johansson The trucktrain in the vid is about 24 meters, so yes they \nmay need to be. And Sweden has about the most loose rules in Europe \nconcerning truck lengths, height and weight. Its road trains that arent \nnecessary in Sweden.\n\nAlso, the main reason we dont use Kenworth, Mack and other unnecessarily \nbig semis, is that in the US they count the allowed length of the truck \nfrom the start of the cargo to end of the train, but in Sweden we count the \nallowed length all the way from the front to the back.'
