the very hungry caterpillar by eric carle 
in the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf 
one sunday morning the warm sun came up and pop out of the egg came a tiny very hungry caterpillar 
he started to look for some food 
on monday he ate through one apple 
but he was still hungry 
on tuesday he ate through two pears 
but he was still hungry 
on wednesday he ate through three plums 
but he was still hungry 
on thursday he ate through four strawberries but he was still hungry 
on friday he ate through five oranges but he was still hungry 
on saturday he ate one peice of chocolate cake one ice cream cone one pickle one slice of swiss cheese one slice of salami one lollipop one peice of cherry pie one sausage one cupcake and one slice of watermellon 
that night he had a stomach ache 
the next day was sunday again 
the caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf and after that he felt much better 
now he was not hungry any more and he was not a little caterpillar any more 
he was a big fat caterpillar 
he buit a small house called a cocoon around himself 
he stayed inside for more than two weeks 
then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon pushed his way out and he was a beautiful butterfly 
the end
