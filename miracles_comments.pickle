V-1. There's not a stock list as much as say, RUG delver. The consensus is, don't start with the legends build as you'll have clunkier opening hands. [Here's my list](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=94584), for reference, which isn't very far off what most everyone seems to be on. \u000a\u000a-2. Lately, the variants have been two mentors main, legendary miracles, or the classic jace/entreat-only as win-conditions. The community is also split it seems on how many predicts is currently right.\u000a\u000a-3a. We'll start bad matchups: 12-Post, MUD, Shardless BUG are the most common ones you'd face in tournament that aren't super favored. 12-Post is probably a 90-10 matchup, and that could be generous. Goblins is also bad, but I wouldn't care too much about that, it's not worth a dedicated sideboard slot in a large tournament.\u000a\u000a-3b. Good matchups, you're likely favored against a good number of decks you'd expect to play, if only slightly. Miracles doesn't have many times you'll sit down and have a practical bye. I've found Elves to be my easiest matchup as far as common decks you'd play.\u000a\u000a-4. The deck luckily contains many pieces for many other decks. It'd be quite easy to transition to most stoneblade/delver decks/the esper mentor lists running around.\u000a\u000a-5. If you prefer control, Miracles is the answer. It's the most dedicated control deck in the format. I've found myself liking Tezzerator as well though, if I really have to list an alternate control deck.\u000a\u000aHope this helps. :) 
p1
aV1/2-  The most popular variants are the 4 ponder lists from the EU pros and Lossett's Karakas Legends builds. The legends build tends to have a better Sneak and Show match up but the Ponder build has better consistency. Lists- http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=11557&d=265766&f=LE\u000a\u000ahttp://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=98922\u000a\u000a\u000a3- For the most part Miracles has fair game against most of the field. 12 post is by far the worst match up and there's really not too much you can do about it, and MUD can be difficult at times as well. Shardless can be fairly grindy because they can keep up with your card advantage and kill your balances with decay.\u000a\u000a4- I don't feel like Wizards cares about Legacy enough to ban anything from the deck, but if they did it would most likely be Terminus. It doesn't cripple the deck by any means but it wouldn't be the undisputed top deck. Honestly Legacy's in a good place so I doubt a banning on Terminus but don't quote me on that because Wizards will do what they want. You can pretty easily build a UWR stoneblade or Delver shell from most of the staples from the deck.\u000a\u000a5- If you haven't tried it before, you could try to play a Delver tempo shell. You play the beat down but you've also got control elements similar to what modern UWR's trying to do. If that's not your cup of tea a Stoneblade shell might be for you if you want to be a little more grindy.
p2
aVTiny trick about balance that took me a disturbingly long time to see: if they use decay and you have a fetch, still use the counterbalance trigger.  You might not want to draw that card.
p3
aVAnother subtle trick, to keep that train rolling: If your opponent is on Abrupt Decay, and you plan to fetch and then spin the top, you should spin first-hold priority-fetch. \u000a\u000aThis way, if they destroy your top in response to the fetchland, you will still get a look at the fresh 3 cards.
p4
aVOf course you should still do this, but now that I'm thinking about it I feel like the players online might have gotten better at playing against miracles over the past year.  It's been a long time since anyone tried to decay my top in response to a fetch or force of will my turn 1 divining top.  The latter used to happen all the time.
p5
aV1. [This](http://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=11557&d=265766&f=LE) is pretty close to stock, though some prefer the 4th terminus to the 3rd Jace, 2nd Counterspell, or 3rd Snapcaster.\u000a\u000a2. The most popular variant is the Legends version with Karakas, Venser, and Vendilion cliques main; spearheaded by Joe Losset, afaik.  It's a strong take on the deck, but it mostly adds a sizable chunk of cash to the cost to raise the skill ceiling a little higher.  There have also been lists in the past capitalizing on other cards, but we haven't seen major Miracles placings with any of them in a long while.  \u000a\u000a3. Miracles is great against most of the unfair decks and has some trouble against most of the creature decks.  There are some exceptions, but that's how most of it's matchups work.  12-post will slaughter you.\u000a\u000a4. The deck is already very close to stoneblade.  Whether stoneblade's lack of showings recently is because the deck isn't strong enough for the meta or because Miracles is stronger and simply cannibalized most of Stoneblade's meta share is hard to say without actually seeing the results of the ban.\u000a\u000a5.  I built miracles and got bored.  If you played Twin before the ban and are looking for something like it, I've been loving Lands for it's ability to go long game when I want it to and to combo out when I want it to.  If you have been on UWR for a while and you are looking to durdle it up, miracles could be right up your ally.
p6
aV> Miracles is great against most of the unfair decks and has some trouble against most of the creature decks.\u000a\u000aUh... it's closer to the opposite, actually. 
p7
aVUnfavorable matchups: most delver variants, D&T, Shardless, 12-Post, Lands, Merfolk, and most Stompy decks.\u000a\u000aFavorable matchups: ANT/TES, Elves, Dredge, S&T/S&S, Reanimator, Stoneblade, and Burn.  \u000a\u000aThat was my experience with the deck; is that different from what you experienced?
p8
aVDnt here. It's in favor of miracles if I don't have a resolved vial. If I resolve vial it's slightly in my favor. At least in my experience
p9
aVWhether or not Merfolk is a good or bad matchup for Miracles depends on if Merfolk is running Chalice. If Merfolk are using Chalice, that tips it a little in favor of Merfolk. If Merfolk isn't running chalice, it's pretty favorable for Miracles.
p10
aVTotally true.  I was under the impression that Chalice was just a given in Merfolk these days, but I could see it being a real metagame choice.
p11
aVThis is how I would rank things:   \u000a\u000a\u000a(hardest)  \u000a\u000a12-post, goblins  \u000aSnS, reanimator, enchantress, eldrazi  \u000amud, jund, aggro-loam, 4c lands, burn,   \u000ashardless, merfolk,   \u000a\u000a-- miracles, DnT, infect   \u000a\u000agrixis, rug, ur, rg lands, esper stoneblade, deathblade  \u000aant, bug (hymn)  \u000auwr, elves,  \u000anic fit, maverick   \u000a\u000a(easiest)  \u000a\u000a\u000a-------\u000a\u000a(Blue color combinations with nothing else indicate the appropriate delver deck. e.g. "grixis" = grixis delver, "rug" = rug delver, etc.)\u000a\u000aI would guess most people will disagree with me on the placement of shardless and infect (saying they should be ranked as more difficult), but I've found that with practice and the correct sideboarding strategy, they are really not very hard.
p12
aVVery different. \u000a\u000aDelver decks are generally easy, and our good matchups vs. them are a big part of why miracles is such a good metagame choice. The fact that you list them in the "unfavorable" category seriously makes me doubt the validity of your experience/skill piloting the deck. \u000a\u000aYou also have SnS, reanimator, and burn in the "favorable" category, when in my experience they are unfavorable. RG lands is a good matchup. I feel favored against most stompy decks, except for sylvan plug, though this is probably depend on sideboards (I run 2 council's between main and sb, so chalice decks are less of a problem for me). 
p13
aVLands is nowhere near favored vs miracles unless the miracles player is bad. Storm vs miracles is also closer to 50/50.
p14
aVSnS is most definitely not a favorable matchup for miracles. Burn isn't anymore either, with firecraft in the mix.
p15
aVRead all Phillipschoneggers stuff.

There are other builds, including a predict-heavy build (removes the white win conditions for more controlling elements), legends-karakas, and rip-helm (don't play this), but worry about those later. 4 ponder is the best one to start with if you're new to the deck.
p18
aVMiracles isn't actually oppressive at all, and occupies a MUCH smaller size of the meta when you remove MTGO results.\u000a\u000aMiracles is by far the cheapest tier one deck on MTGO, so it's played left and right.\u000aThis is not the case when it comes to paper. (For example: a set of Rishadan Ports are more expensive than 2 sets of power 9)\u000a\u000a\u000aThe honest truth is that the deck isn't overpowered, but many people don't like control so they'd rather see it banned.\u000a\u000aWill it get banned? I hope not, the meta is fine as it is. If Modern has taught us anything it is that if it isn't broken, you shouldn't try to fix it.
p19
aVDepends on the local meta as well, in oslo we have something like 5-6 miracles players and the problem is round times and slow toppers.
p20
aVYou shouldn't take more than 5 seconds to rearrange your top 3 cards, anything over 15 seconds is grounds for slow play in my opinion.
p21
aVThe honest answere is if they are going to ban something in Legacy the highest chance is that it is something from Miracles, i personly think it will not be top but terminus. \u000a\u000aBut there are rearly bans in legacy and after the modern ban debacle, i don't think the next ban will heave any changes, besides maybe unbans. \u000a\u000aSo Miracles is the deck with the highest risk in the format but still the % is realy low.
p22
aVHonestly I've always seen the problem to be counterbalance. It's a chalice of the void but only for your opponent. Which is quiet broken. \u000a\u000a\u000aBut regards to the question at hand. I can't see them banning out anything from miracles. Its great to have a real control deck. There's nothing really wrong with it. And if we do ban miracles everyone better get ready for our ANT overlords.
p23
aVI think that's a poor estimation of it. Counterbalance is what makes the deck, but terminus is what pushes it over the top. There are other CB lock decks, and none of them are oppressive. It's a two card combo that dies to one of the most prevalent removal spells in the format. \u000a\u000a\u000aLegacy seems like a format where, when bans are appropriate, they don't aim to kill, or even maim decks, they just clip their fingernails enough to put them back in line.\u000a\u000a\u000aAdditionally, I'll admit a little bias. this is kind of a ban that I want to see happen because terminus is what takes that deck and makes it I fun to play against. 1 mana boardwipes too easily push fair decks out of the format. Maverick, for instance would jump at least a tier if miracles had to resort to supreme verdict. 
p24
aVAs someone who has played it for years i agree with digitalpsycho it will not be tops that will get banned from miracles (because tops are needed in other decks that are in a good place 12 post, high tide, Painter's Servant) it would be terminus. because a 1 white tuck all creatures is good.
p25
aV>So Miracles is the deck with the highest risk in the format but still the % is realy low.\u000a\u000aAgreed.  The only way I see something getting banned is if they first print something new that's super strong in miracles and pushes it over the edge 
p26
aVWell, with a new return to Innistrad coming out soon, if any new miracles were to be printed, the time would be "soon".
p27
aVMiracles is kind of a feel-bad mechanic though and I don't expect them to make more miracle cards in the new sets.
p28
aVOh look, here's the Bonfire I just topdecked. Have fun!
p29
aVMiracles' stock in the format hasn't much changed since the DTT ban, and it's just more-or-less back to where it was before Cruise/Dig were printed.  As /u/Digitalpsycho said it's probably the highest-risk deck in the format, but if they were gonna ban something from it I suspect they would have by now.
p30
aVI'd be shocked if they banned something from miracles. Yeah, it's a good deck, but you can't just pick it up and clean up a SCG or a GP. It's a lot of practice to play well, and if you sequence even a little bit wrong, you can just get killed. \u000a\u000aIf they ban something (Top) it's not going to be because of power, but because of logistics. Miracles usually puts 0-1 people into T8 of big events, which is par for a deck that's 8-12% of the meta, so power level is par. The real problem is slow players taking too much time at tournaments. But SeaTac went off mostly without hitches, so I can't see them doing it in the future unless a whole bunch of people pick up miracles and start playing very slowly at big events. \u000a\u000aWhich, incidentally, could be solved by calling slow play on your opponents. If someone looks at a top for longer than 15 seconds, and they knew two cards already, I start nudging them. 
p31
aVI think a lot of the discussion about banning miracles pieces comes from how WotC handles modern. They've never really banned cards in legacy because a few too many people were playing a deck, they ban because cards are broken. Banning a piece of miracles would be a major shift in legacy ban philosophy.
p32
aVTop's only issue in the format is how it slows matches down drastically. The complaint is it causes slow play, and I personally have joined that train. I haven't run Top in the past 2 years. Sure, my decks aren't as consistent as they could be, but I don't enjoy playing Top for Top's sake. But I don't think it's overpowered, and I'm completely fine with people running it in a CounterTop package. 
p33
aVIf Top is causing slowplay, prompt your opponent to player faster. If that doesn't work, call a judge. Problem solved.
p34
aVI have numerous times. In my experience judges seems very hesitant to actually punish for slowplay. The worst was when I went up against a D&T player who showed up late to a game 1 loss, and then obviously tried to drag game 2 out to a draw. 3 times I called a judge, but it wasn't until we went to turns until they actually did anything about his 3 minute EoT Top activations staring at 3 lands.
p35
aVThat sucks, and sounds like the judge wasn't doing a very good job, but it is nowhere near to being a good reason to ban top. 
p36
aVTop is only as slow as the player. So if a player is not good with the deck, or topping (which we have seen a lot of since the influx of miracles players that were attracted during the DTT meta), then they top slower. Otherwise,imo, it's no slower than a brainstorm in response to something or a ponder. A good miracles player should be able to quickly assess what is or is not needed on the top of the library at that time.
p37
aVRight. And the more you know your deck and the matchup, the less time you spend looking at 3 cards. The problem with Top is it can fit in anywhere being colorless, and the fact that you can look whenever you can pay 1, where as Brainstorm requires blue and you can only play 4 copies. 
p38
aVAren't we talking about SDT in the context of Miracles though? And considering SDT is only heavily played in Miracles as well...
p39
aVI went off on a general format rant. Top sees lots of play in rogue lists, and slows decks down. It's become less of a problem IMO over the last 2 years. All I'm saying is if they ban a piece from Miracles (which I don't think they will), Top is a top candidate (no pun intended) if they want to deal with a long held, albeit somewhat quiet, complaint about Top's slowing the format down. Additionally, Top going away instead of Terminus or Entreat allows the deck to exist without the same consistency, which is a WotC-like move. 
p40
aV>Additionally, Top going away instead of Terminus or Entreat allows the deck to exist without the same consistency, which is a WotC-like move. \u000a\u000aThe core card that holds the entire deck together is SDT. Take that away, and you've made the deck unplayable. 
p41
aV>Otherwise,imo, it's no slower than a brainstorm in response to something or a ponder.\u000a\u000aDifference being that you generally don't cast brainstorm 30 times in a game.  Whether or not it is too slow or not is debatable but denying that top does, in fact, extend the time a match takes to complete is nonsense.  Personally, I'm of the opinion that terminus is the real problem card of the deck if we are discussing time issues.
p42
aV> Personally, I'm of the opinion that terminus is the real problem card of the deck if we are discussing time issues.\u000a\u000aAhh, so wrath of god should be banned because it slows down games too much. Gotcha.
p43
aVIf wrath of god was a cmc 1 instant that you couldn't interact with via hand disruption.
p44
aVLast I checked, wrath of god didn't have to be miracled from the top of your library...
p45
aVIf that were a serious issue miracles would not be the premier counterbalance deck 4 years running.  Are you really trying to suggest that wrath of god and terminus with top in your deck are even comparable?  \u000a\u000aGet real.  The simple fact of the matter is that the hyper efficient nature of terminus and the way that the miracle mechanic naturally functions means that the soft counter magic that is dominant in legacy is fairly ineffective against terminus and hand disruption is nearly moot against it.  With that in mind the only two truly effective methods off counterplay is to play extremely conservatively with your threats and have hard counterspells (barring, of course, repeatable tutors and non-creature threats).  With this the ability to get in underneath the soft lock off countertop is eliminated (which was one of the best ways to beat counterbalance decks if yore) and the game is forced to go long.  With fair games forced to go long the counterbalance deck can afford to minimize threats and lean hard on the counterbalance lock which will cause the games to take even longer.\u000a\u000aEliminating terminus from the equation means that the countertop player can no longer depend in the game to go long and they will need to take a much more proactive role.  With the control player in a more proactive role the length off games is reduced.\u000a\u000aWhile it is certainly debatable whether or not the problem presented by the miracles deck is significant enough to warrant action it is nonsense to deny that it does present a logistics issue.  If the conclusion of that debate is that the issues presented by the miracles deck do warrant action terminus is the first card I would go after for the reasons outlined above combined with the fact that eliminating terminus does not necessarily eliminate countertop while eliminating countertop does eliminate decks from running terminus.
p46
aVI'm not denying it slows down games, but it's an element of what is effectively a draw go control deck strategy, regardless of top being there control strategies will make games go longer. I agree that terminus is the most problematic card in the deck, but I don't think anything deserves the ban hammer. The format is healthy.
p47
aVI remember distinctly LSV saying something to the effect of "I should get to use Top, it isn't *my* fault that everyone else doesn't know what they are doing..." when talking about Top being banned in modern. Just a quick little fun fact.
p48
aVit does feel bad when cards have to be banned because of bad players though. just give slow play warnings more readily and actually give a game loss for it once in a while. give people who play slowly a reason to play quicker.
p49
aVIf Wizards want to ban Miracles, they would have done it already. Just get the cards and join the bandwagon.
p50
aVBecause legacy isn't a PT format they generally just let the metagame sort itself out. Miracles isn't without weakness. Shardless has a decent matchup vs it for instance.
p51
aVThe deck is incredibly strong, but ultimately fair. It is good at countering spells, but quite weak to resolved noncreature permanents, with only Pyroblast and REB as answers to a Jace, and next to nothing to get rid of a Liliana. The worst strike against it is the fact that new/poor players draw rounds in paper because they don't know what they're doing/don't know what they're doing, respectively. It doesn't hold any decks out of the format (at least, no decks trying to do anything "fair"). It doesn't place a ridiculous amount of players into the top of tournaments, but you will usually see at least one in the top 16 at least. I love Miracles, and I would recommend playing it if you like it. However, before you take it to a major tournament, get good with it so you don't take forever and a day playing it. 
p52
aVNothing's getting banned. \u000a\u000aThe deck's been around for 4 years now and top is still around. People (bitches) dislike the deck for various reasons, so they label the deck "oppressive" and call for a ban. (reasons include: they don't know how to play against it, they dislike playing against control, unskilled miracles pilots that take too much time with top, etc.)\u000a\u000aIn reality, the deck will consistently put 2-3 people into the t16 of tournaments, which is solid results, but a far cry from "oppressive". 
p53
aVAs a Miracles player, I am always very happy when my opponent leaves Strix in postboard against me.
p54
aVWhy?
p55
aVBecause it's basically two mana draw a card against Miracles. Sure, sometimes Miracles was leaning on a Clique to combat Jace, and Strix would shine there. But most of the time it draws a card, and does very little until it gets swept away with a Terminus.\u000a\u000aOn top of this, you have important cards that need to come in -- specifically Needle and Null Rod. And you have to cut something. Force is your worst card, but it's a necessary evil to hedge against Entreat, Terminus, and Jace. So the 1/1 that cantrips is usually the first to go.
p56
aVYou wasted your turn cycling at sorcery speed.
p57
aVI play Aluren very often, and the match-up vs Miracles is incredibly positive -- in large part due to cantrip dudes like Strix and Coiling Oracle (and recruiter doing a great squadron hawk impression).  I settle in for a slow attrition game, getting one damage at a time.  These little dorks are a big problem for miracles if you settle into a strategy of just sitting back and slowly bleeding them.  Every mode they have of answering these things is a net negative
p58
aVAs a miracles player, this 100%. Strix may not seem impressive but a board of, say, shardless + strix will necessitate a terminus eventually, putting shardless ahead in a pretty serious way. Deathtouch is also slightly more relevant with mentor supplanting entreat.
p59
aVIt's bad as it will never get there on it's own, but since it cantrips it's never bad...
p60
aVWould you side more in if you feel you have cards to take out?\u000a\u000aI've been unimpressed with Hymn against Miracles as it's great in the opener but topdecking them on hellbent feels miserable.
p61
aVHymn is AMAZING against Control decks. It's like a mini-Mind Twist. It's a great topdeck. 
p62
aVSure, but I don't believe I'd take Hymns out...they might Force Hymn but they'd never Force Strix...\u000a\u000a
p63
aVMiracles does not have FoW postboard against Shardless.
p64
aVIf you have more cards to take out than side in, and you're siding in Balefuls, you've constructed your sideboard and mainboard wrong. 
p65
aVSeems like one of the worst cards you can cascade in to.
p66
aVI like it because it cantrips and they have to eventually use removal on it. That being said my local meta isn't miracles heavy so I don't have many sideboard slots designated for it. If I did I'd probably cut it
p67
aVYou can't get value out of death touch
p68
aVThe problem is the 1 power. You can wait an incredibly long time to kill the opponent. Or you have to extend multiple threats to speed up the clock. At that point you get Terminus'd and you lose the card advantage you gained and wasted your turn casting the thing.\u000a\u000aIt isn't a bad card since it draws, but it won't win you the game. Something like StoneForge Mystic is higher impact and technically draws a card. It can get there on its own if they don't plow it.
p69
aVI do like this card because when it gets terminused the miracle player has not gained any card advantage (as long as it was only strix and 1 other creature). I leave mine in and bring in K Grip, Null Rod, Pithing Needle, Vendilion Clique, and Notion Thief for 3 MD forces and 2 MD Thoughtseize.
p70
aVI always side out Strix against non-creature decks. The reason you play it is to block/eat removal spells against aggressive decks and decks that try to win with large flyers(reanimator, primarily). \u000a\u000aIt's just too slow and you have better sources of card advantage against things like Miracles.

aVIf I were to pick up a miracles list, I'd probably sleeve up the exact 75 of [Mzfroste](http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=11531&d=265607&f=LE), which runs Snapcaster as the only creature in the main. There's a slight bias here, as he's one of my buddies and I've personally watched him put up some very good results (he's the dick in our playgroup that always keeps us late at opens because he's top 8ing), and I've watched him make slight tweaks to the deck as the meta has changed with continued good results. 
p72
aVOne question I have for this list specifically is when do you bring in Mentors? Two MD Redblasts also seems like a lot, but probably fine considering that the nonblue decks should be decent matchups anyways.
p73
aVIt's not me, but I know that he brings them in against decks like shardless bug and matchups  where he needs to establish a fast clock. As a note, two redblasts is not optimal, but they're cheaper that 1 reb 1 pyroblast online. I'll shoot him a message and I'm sure he'll come in and correct my non miracles playing ass if I've  gotten anything wrong.
p74
aVYeah I'd just run Pyroblasts anyways as I already have them on my MTGO account. Also the difference is like 1 ticket on a deck I am already spending a lot on so that won't make it huge anyways.
p75
aVI would run all pyros in any build that has mentors in the 75. Personally, I don't think the upside of burning a pyroblast for mentor triggers outweigh the fringe benefits of REBs narrow targeting and the greater resiliency to surgical extraction.\u000a\u000aThe most common relevance of REB's targeting is that it can't be Misdirected to non-blue things. This is almost never a real issue since the primary deck that plays Misdirection is Sneak and Show and they are almost always looking to misdirect your blast to Misdirection, which is already blue and thus a valid target for both red blasts.
p76
aVIt seems to run counter the the existing sentiment in the thread, but I'd recommend a list with mentors. I'd surmise that the European group that brought us the ponder miracles deck probably puts the most testing into their lists and the most recent listing from Schonegger or Cadei is the two mentors list that they have been having some good results with since last year.  Personally I like the speedier win con that mentor represents.\u000a\u000ahttp://www.mtgtop8.com/event?e=11448&d=265007&f=LE\u000a\u000aThat said if you're dead set against mentors, go with the mzfroste list, he at least does well on modo rather often.
p77
aVIf it is rather the consent that it is best to run with Mentors I am not deadset against running them. I just am not a huge fan of the card, but hey i still get to play Jaces :) I am currently mostly looking for input as I want to play Legacy on modo now that we have leagues on there
p78
aVI am a pretty new miracles player. I play with 2 mentors in the main (pretty much the Cadei list). I find him to be very good at closing out games quickly. One advantage with him is unlike entreat, it doesn't have to be drawn off the top to play. No brainstorm or Jace is needed to get the card back on top. I've found if he survives, its pretty much game. Being new to the format, he helps shore up an ignorance of the format. I wish mentor was as good in modern as he is in legacy.    
p79
aVThere isn't really a consensus on how to build Miracles, it's just personal preference. For someone starting out with the deck online, I'd suggest more wincons main, as time will not be on your side, at least at first.
p80
aVThe upside is... If you get into any miracles deck, the difference in cards amounts to a few bucks.  I mean between Cadei and mzfroste the biggest difference is that the mentors are in the side for mz's list.  That just a quick eyeing of the lists, but there might be five cards that are different in the 75 from a quick glance.  So you're not tied down to any particular build.  
p81
aV[My 75](http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=97887). I dislike Mentor and prefer the classic strategy. I have never run to time, but I do play quickly. If you're just starting, miracles is a deck that's classically in the draw bracket. Remembering which what cards are on top help a lot.
p82
aVI would personally recommend starting with a Mentor list until you are comfortable and speedy enough with the deck to not draw any rounds. I still prefer to play a Mentor list, but I can see why you would want to play Miracles instead of Miracle**~~s~~**.
p83
aVIf you are new to the Legacy format, or just new to Miracles in general, any non-legend Miracles would work. In other words, any lists that don't run 2 Caverns would work. This includes lists from Reid Duke. The reasoning is that 2 Cavern Legend Miracles has a very clunky mana base, and every fetch-breaking decision can be magnified if you fetch for the wrong land.
p84
aVI'm a big fan of the legends build with clique, venser, and karakas. Joe Lossett is the person whos lists I'd refer to if you were to go that route, they should be all over mtgtop8 and scg
p85
aVIf you are not familiar enough with miracles and the legacy format to pick a list I would strongly advise picking a different deck. Miracles is probably the best deck in legacy in an open meta, but it is also one of the hardest decks to pilot and requires flawless understanding of both the deck and the format to pilot optimally. Also unlike many legacy decks a bad miracles pilot won't get very many free wins due to the decks inherent power. \u000a\u000aInstead until you know the format a lot better you should probably play something unfair and linear like sneak and show. 
p86
aVI don't fear losing with the deck and I know I will lose a lot starting out. I just want to play a dck that I have the passion for a deck I want to play and that just happens to be blue control and specifically for Jace. I also just don't have the means to switch around decks a lot.
p87
aVYou should play what you want to play then, but I just thought it wise to warn you that you will not necessarily have a good time at first. 
p88
aVI play Jace in the following situations:\u000a\u000a1. I am very far ahead but lack a closer or have excessive spare mana despite having a closer already.\u000a\u000a2. I am ahead on board or the board is stable but there are many cards still in my opponent's hand and the game is in question still, but I have significant counterspell/counter-top backup to help land Jace. \u000a\u000a3. I am significantly behind and need to use Jace to try and stabilize (i.e., I plan to unsommon or else I expect Jace to die and that is OK with me).\u000a\u000a4. I specifically need a Brainstorm effect and I am willing to pay 4CMC at sorcery speed for it (i.e. I need to put Terminus back and then Terminus on opps. upkeep not to die). \u000a\u000a5. I specifically want to fateseal. This usually happens against Combo/Burn after Clique-ing them and finding nothing concerning in hand. 
p89
aVThis boils down to playing Jace on turn 4 only when well behind as you have little else to do that could matter and otherwise holding him until later when I can be more sure he will survive to win the game with me one way or another. 
p90
aVfor me, jace is normally played after I know I'm in control of the game, or when I need to land him in order to take over.  For example, after I've established the soft lock, introducing jace is generally lights out.\u000a\u000aIf my opponent is on a stumbly start, and I know that they won't be able to deal with it, I'd be more inclined to just slam it, but I'd rather have 5-6 lands down before even trying.

aVThis was helpful thanks!
