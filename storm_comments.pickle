VPlease try and convince as many people as possible to play this archetype. \u000a\u000aSincerely,  \u000aLands pilots
p1
aVYes Lands is a rough matchup for this deck :/ I imagine the surge of Eldrazi popularity may push Storm down a bit too which will help you guys a lot.
p2
aV12 Post doesn't have a particularly amazing time against it, but it's a lot easier for me to tune vs Eldrazi (and consequently other aggro) than it is vs Storm, so I'm pretty welcoming of this.
p3
aVHow is the Infect and Sneak and Show matchup? Wasn't mentioned on the podcast
p4
aVWhat are your thoughts on the fast mana (IE deck needs mox diamond/spirit guides) and Thorn of Amethyst over Trinisphere arguments? \u000a\u000aI can't listen to it at the moment, but I'll be sure to soon. 
p5
aVHey Baxter, I tested Thorn quite a bit and was not a fan. It does not help you with one of the weaknesses of this deck which is big, efficient creatures. Trinisphere acts more like a lock piece with our Wastelands, and I have really enjoyed having the 2 in our list.\u000a\u000aI tested Mox Diamond but not Simian Spirit Guide. Diamond was too "all-in" for me, and I felt like it made my turn 1 more explosive but overall made me weaker to Wasteland and made it more difficult to cast smashers and Endbringers.
p6
aVMox Diamond seems HORRIBLE here.\u000a\u000aIt's not a ramp deck, not really. The 2, 4, and 6 Drops are really 1, 2, and 3 Drops. It's a low to the ground Tempo Deck with Wastelands, it's just the deck's color is {2}. Putting Mox Diamond in this deck is actually worse than putting it in like RUG Delver. Its effect is just as unwanted, but it gets the added bonus of only being worth half a mana and managing to be off-color.
p7
aVI'm sure this and other Eldrazi decks will be fairly popular in Philly, and wouldn't be surprised if there is one in top 8.  There are no Eldrazi decks in the top 16 of the louisville scg classic last weekend though.  Even after a modern open loaded with eldrazi on day 1.
p8
aVIn this episode, the cast talks Phil\u2019s pro tour success, Eternal Masters, and the newest ~~Tier 1~~ deck in Legacy, Eldrazi Aggro.\u000a\u000aFind The Brainstorm Show's current Eldrazi Aggro list [here](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/22-02-16-Qpb-eldrazi-aggro/)\u000a\u000aSmall warning: Wilson\u2019s microphone was doing strange things in this episode, so please pardon any sound issues on his end.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Removed "Tier 1" because as /u/William_Dearborn pointed out the term refers to tournament finishes. 
p9
aVIt almost sounds as if he's not using a pop filter? It's killing my car speakers. :( good job on the cast though! 
p10
aVLink to decklist is broken for me :(
p11
aVSorry about that...should work now!
p12
aVGuys, please stop freaking out and down-voting over semantics. We have an hour and a half of content backed by dozens of hours of testing and multiple 5-0 results posted by WotC; it's demoralizing when most feedback is focused on two words Paul said while trying to advertise the episode. Thanks
p13
aVMy issue wasn't with calling the deck 'good', just on what is the conventional definition for 'tier 1'. (And for the record, I didn't downvote, I understood it was an advertisement, and just wanted to explain why some people may have had an issue with the phrase)\u000a\u000aI think the deck is sweet, and much like MUD has a lot of really good MUs and some really bad MUs (and hands for that matter).\u000a\u000aOne of the biggest issues with the current feedback is that most people did not test the same list you guys did. So, if you pair that fact with variance (sometimes you go 10-0 against a list and sometimes you get smashed in a set of similar length) it is no great wonder to me how people have such different feelings about the matchups.\u000a\u000aI did enjoy the podcast, thank you for being one of the few Legacy focused ones. =]
p14
aV> Guys, please stop freaking out and down-voting over semantics.\u000a\u000aThen it wouldn't be Reddit.\u000a\u000aGreat podcast, and I always appreciate your content. Although I disagree with 3ball in the shell, I think your overall list is extremely solid. Let's see what happens at the SCG Open!
p15
aVIt doesn't have any large event finishes so it can't really be called Tier 1
p16
aVOh technicalities! Give it a few events! Play it yourself, you'll see what we mean. 
p17
aVSo I have played a couple Eldrazi (both Stompy, and big mana) decks a few times.\u000a\u000aI really like the podcast, but one thing really stuck with me... The mention that Wasteland isn't a problem for this deck.\u000a\u000aI have found that Wasteland can be a *very* big problem.  Strange that you guys feel differently.  You mentioned going 10/0 against Delver, and I've also played many games.  One Wasteland isn't always game over, but it is often painful.  A second Wasteland can be backbreaking.  With the Delver decks packing 8 cantrips and 8ish Fetches, it isn't hard for them to find a second if they detect that your mana is vulnerable (ie, stopping on two lands, or Wasting a non-City land).\u000a\u000aI'm not saying you are undoubtedly wrong, but it's interesting we've come to polar opposite conclusions on Wasteland.
p18
aVHey Krond,\u000aI definitely used some hyperbole saying that Wasteland doesn't matter.  Delver decks can create some issues for you with Dazes and multiple Wastelands on the play.  That being said, this is worlds apart from something like MUD or a Cloudpost-based deck where a single Wasteland is always fantastic. From my testing Wasteland is likely worse against this Eldrazi deck than most decks in the format.  Look at it as the creatures costing half of what they actually cost, yet many of our lands are twice as good against Daze protection or even make creatures immune (Cavern).  We can power out our 2-mana guys, Endless Ones, and Thought-Knots pretty effectively through Wasteland.
p19
aVThe deck is a flash in the pan. It's nowhere even NEAR tier 1. 
p20
aVGiven I tested 10 matches against them with Grixis and went 8-2 I kinda have to agree. Especially the loss of lifelink compared to MUD makes it "just" a good creature deck with some prison elements. Their threats have problems with Tarmogoyf, Gurmag Angler, Monastery Mentor and Young Pyromancer, not really having something to push through besides a few removal spells. \u000a\u000aAlso Wasting them is really an option, I won more than once through a turn 1 Chalice since Wasteland, Daze, Force of Will, YP and Angler are still great cards, not to speak of a turn 1 delver/shaman you might have played when you're on the play. \u000a\u000aDon't get me wrong, I still think it's a better deck than MUD (less powerfull, but more consistent) and it seems to have pretty good matchups against Storm and Miracles, but against BUG, Grixis, Death & Taxes, Sneak&Show, Lands, heck, even fringe decks like Cloudpost and Stompy it seems just unfavorable...
p21
aVI must say that I tested against Mengucci's list he 4-0ed a daily with: \u000a\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B10P8JY_peg\u000a\u000aYours seems to be more refined, still I have the feeling that when sticking to simple principles (only counter removals when no other threats in hand, waste and counter their big stuff) it seems just a really solid matchup from the Delver side, sometimes even around a Chalice. Cavern-hands often times seem pretty slow while noncavern-hands get out-tempoed by Delver, Pyromancer and Angler. \u000a\u000aJust my experience here, I definitely like the deck due to its consistency,I'll give it more tests in the future. I just can't understand how your guy won 10 out of 10 games against Grixis. \u000a\u000aOn a side note it seems to me that this matchup isn't as skill-intensive from both sides as other Legacy matches, so it doesn't matter as much how good your grixis player was but rather what opening hands both players had. 
p22
aVI agree with your points; I don't think the Grixis Delver matchup is anywhere near "10-0" quality in reality, but I have only lost a single match to Grixis Delver after testing against it many times online. Even if I agree with some of the theory that you guys are saying, it's hard to be swayed from my experience against Delver.

p24
aVJust from a definition standpoint, it's generally accepted that "tier" refers to metashare, not how good a deck is. (Despite those two having a high correlation)
p25
aVThe high highs and the low lows.  Man, a lot of that hits close to home.  I played nothing but storm after getting into legacy but eventually got burnt out from playing behind too many counter-top locks.  Now being on the other side of the matchup I don't mind losing to a storm opponent.  I get caught up in thinking about what they could have or how they sequence their lines, it turns out being a good learning experience.\u000a\u000aI enjoyed your previous series so definitely looking forward to this one too.
p26
aVThanks for the kind words! Playing storm is definitely challenging, especially versus hard control, but it's a learning process. One thing I didn't mention in my piece is that I also originally learned storm to understand how to play against it. Over time, though, I've grown to love the deck more and more.\u000a\u000aI'll be releasing more samples soon. Hope you enjoy those, as well as the completed book.
p27
aVI think Storm is one of those decks that only specific players will enjoy playing. I primarily play Affinity in Modern and have found that they have a similar thought process. Both decks are extremely powerful, require being able to read the situation, do the math, and sometimes be willing to go for it knowing that if they have the answer you just lose. \u000a\u000aFor me there is nothing better than hitting exactly 10 storm count with zero mana left or figuring out how to sequence everything to fight through something like Top/CB + counter. 
p28
aVPardon my intrusion, but I think you're wrong in the history of storm as a mechanic and of decks based around it. \u000a\u000aIt didn't take time for storm to become competitive, nor did it need additional cards. Mind's desire was legal and tier 1/tier1.5 in standard. UW desire was absolutely tier 1 in extended immediately as well. A short time later, before legacy even existed and all we had was t1.5, twiddle desire was winning on the first turn in extended. In vintage, the fabled long.dec started winning uncontrolably in the summer of 2003, a mere three months after Scourge (where the mechanic was launched) released. Not only that, but in October 2004, when legacy became the format it was meant to be until today, there were already storm decks being tested in the dojo, source, articles on SCG about storm, the very week after the announcement.\u000a\u000aIt is not a testament to ingenuity (well, long.dec was, without a doubt, but the major innovation there was the usage of burning wish to get 4 virtual copies of yawgmoth's will instead of the actual storm mechanic). This wasn't the case of a deck slowly built over years. As soon as the mechanic was released, it was EVERYWHERE.\u000a\u000aSome facts to back this up:\u000a\u000aStandard: http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2003-european-championship-all-standard-decks-2003-07-08 (I'd give you the top 16 but the page is 404ing) where both kai budde, dirk baberowski, marco blume, etc, played the deck. This is a mere two months after the expansion released, and the deck got top 16.\u000a\u000aExtended: http://forcespike.altervista.org/_magic/desire.htm shows a large amount of players including several hall of famers that used the deck in the extended portion of the worlds, which happened a mere month later (three months after scourge). It was everywhere. [[Sunscape familiar]],  [[Nightscape familiar]] and [[sapphire medallion]] powered the deck into absurdity.\u000a\u000aVintage: The first decklists showed up before the cards were even legal, and mind's desire was restricted one month and a half after scourge became legal (http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dci/announce/dci20030529a). Four weeks later long.dec first showed up on the scene and by mid August was considered the strongest deck in the format, a title it still holds to this day (http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/vintage/5820_Burning_Through_Type_One_With_The_Fastest_Deck_In_Magic.html). \u000a\u000aLegacy: Legacy was revamped as a format in October 2004. The first competitive storm decks in the format were seen in November I think, but it is hard to find information about early legacy, as there were not serious tournaments until later.\u000a\u000aDoes this seem like something that took time, required cards and ingenuity to achieve? :P If anything, current storm decks are MUCH WEAKER than they were in the past...\u000a\u000aI hope you keep writing, but these small bits kind of paint a totally different picture than what really happened.
p29
aVThank you for the detailed background. I might have to change things up a little in the book, but that's totally great to understand the context.\u000a\u000aI'd be curious to know whether cards like Mind's Desire were designed to be insanely good, or whether it was an unexpected design scenario like Memory Jar?\u000a\u000aI stand by Maro's storm scale -- it made it sound as if the power level was a mistake.
