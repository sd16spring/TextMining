1
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:20,599
Hello.

2
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:24,228
My name's Forrest. Forrest Gump.

3
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,819
Do you want a chocolate?

4
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:37,825
I could eat about
a million and a half of these.

5
00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:44,206
My mama always said
life was like a box of chocolates.

6
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:49,086
You never know what you're gonna get.

7
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,846
Those must be comfortable shoes.

8
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:04,893
I'll bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that and not feel a thing.

9
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:09,565
I wish I had shoes like that.

10
00:04:10,232 --> 00:04:11,774
My feet hurt.

11
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:14,652
Mama always said there's an awful lot

12
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:17,947
you could tell about a person
by their shoes:

13
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:22,034
Where they're going,
where they've been.

14
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:31,335
I've worn lots of shoes.

15
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:39,260
I bet if I think about it real hard,
I could remember my first pair of shoes.

16
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,807
Mama said they'd take me anywhere.

17
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:48,227
She said they was my magic shoes.

18
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:51,480
All right, Forrest,
you can open your eyes now.

19
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,240
Let's take a little walk around.

20
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,832
How do those feel?

21
00:05:12,794 --> 00:05:14,962
His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump,

22
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:17,548
as strong as I've ever seen,

23
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:21,010
but his back is as crooked
as a politician.

24
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:25,389
But we're gonna straighten him right up,
now, aren't we, Forrest?

25
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:26,599
Forrest!

26
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:29,310
Now, when I was a baby,

27
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:32,230
Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero,

28
00:05:32,314 --> 00:05:34,732
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

29
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:37,026
She said we was related to him
in some way.

30
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,486
And what he did was,

31
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,823
he started up this club called
the Ku Klux Klan.

32
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:46,244
They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bed sheets

33
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:50,665
and act like a bunch of ghosts
or spooks or something.

34
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:54,627
They'd even put bed sheets
on their horses and ride around.

35
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:57,755
And anyway, that's how I got my name,

36
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,257
Forrest Gump.

37
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:01,092
Mama said that the "Forrest" part

38
00:06:01,176 --> 00:06:04,720
was to remind me that sometimes
we all do things that,

39
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:07,598
well, just don't make no sense.

40
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,774
Okay... Get it, get it...

41
00:06:16,858 --> 00:06:19,819
Wait, is it this way? Hold on.

42
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:22,238
All right...

43
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:24,490
What are you all staring at?

44
00:06:24,574 --> 00:06:29,036
Haven't you ever seen a little boy
with braces on his legs before?

45
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,292
Don't ever let anybody tell you
they're better than you, Forrest.

46
00:06:34,376 --> 00:06:36,961
If God intended
everybody to be the same,

47
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:39,170
he'd have given us all braces
on our legs.

48
00:06:39,255 --> 00:06:40,964
Mama always had a way of
explaining things

49
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:43,049
so I could understand them.

50
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,013
We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,

51
00:06:48,097 --> 00:06:51,141
about a half mile from
the town of Greenbow, Alabama.

52
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:53,977
That's in the county of Greenbow.

53
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:58,481
Our house had been in Mama's family
since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa

54
00:06:58,566 --> 00:07:00,483
had come across the ocean
about 1,000 years ago,

55
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:02,485
something like that.

56
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,280
Since it was just me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,

57
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:08,116
Mama decided to let those rooms out,

58
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,160
mostly to people passing through,

59
00:07:10,244 --> 00:07:14,205
like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.

60
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,000
That's how me and Mama got money.

61
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:19,836
Mama was a real smart lady.

62
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,924
Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different than anybody else is.

63
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:29,804
Did you hear what I said, Forrest?

64
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,059
You're the same as everybody else.
You are no different.

65
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,022
Your boy's different, Mrs. Gump.

66
00:07:39,106 --> 00:07:41,316
Now, his IQ is 75.

67
00:07:42,109 --> 00:07:45,236
Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock.

68
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:50,867
She wanted me to have
the finest education,

69
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:54,871
so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.

70
00:07:54,955 --> 00:07:57,207
I met the principal and all.

71
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,585
I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.

72
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:03,922
Now, this is normal.

73
00:08:04,423 --> 00:08:07,717
Forrest is right here.

74
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:14,099
The state requires a minimum IQ of
80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump.

75
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,477
He's gonna have to go
to a special school.

76
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:19,687
Now, he'll be just fine.

77
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:22,565
What does "normal" mean, anyway?

78
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,027
He might be a bit on the slow side,

79
00:08:27,154 --> 00:08:28,905
but my boy Forrest is gonna get

80
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:31,533
the same opportunities
as everyone else.

81
00:08:31,617 --> 00:08:35,412
He's not going to some special school
to learn how to re-tread tires.

82
00:08:35,496 --> 00:08:38,665
We're talking about
five little points here.

83
00:08:40,376 --> 00:08:43,002
There must be something can be done.

84
00:08:44,588 --> 00:08:47,048
We're a progressive school system.

85
00:08:47,883 --> 00:08:50,802
We don't want to see anybody
left behind.

86
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,140
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

87
00:08:58,394 --> 00:09:00,270
He's on vacation.

88
00:09:17,745 --> 00:09:21,540
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.

89
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:29,506
You don't say much, do you?

90
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:42,978
"Finally, he had to try.

91
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:45,022
"It looked easy, but,

92
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:48,567
"oh, what happened.

93
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:51,653
- "First, there... "
- Mama, what's "vacation" mean?

94
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:54,781
- Vacation?
- Where Daddy went.

95
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,120
Vacation's when you go somewhere

96
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:04,833
and you don't ever come back.

97
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:12,966
Anyway, I guess you could
say me and Mama was on our own.

98
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:17,804
But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.

99
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:20,474
There was always folks
coming and going.

100
00:10:20,558 --> 00:10:21,642
Supper.

101
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:25,145
- It's supper, everyone. Forrest...
- My, my. That sure looks special.

102
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,773
Sometimes we had
so many people staying with us

103
00:10:27,857 --> 00:10:30,526
that every room
was filled with travelers.

104
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,238
You know, folks living out
of their suitcases

105
00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:37,282
and hat cases and sample cases.

106
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:40,786
Forrest Gump, it's supper time! Forrest...

107
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,413
One time, a young man
was staying with us,

108
00:10:43,498 --> 00:10:47,125
and he had him a guitar case.

109
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:05,102
Forrest! I told you not to bother
this nice young man.

110
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:06,520
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.

111
00:11:06,604 --> 00:11:09,439
I was just showing him a thing or two
on the guitar here.

112
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:12,484
All right, but your supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.

113
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:15,529
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.

114
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:19,783
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you just did there.

115
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:21,743
Slow it down some.

116
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:25,789
I liked that guitar.

117
00:11:26,457 --> 00:11:28,208
It sounded good.

118
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:34,172
I started moving around to the music,

119
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:36,090
swinging my hips.

120
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:41,220
This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,

121
00:11:41,305 --> 00:11:44,307
and we walked right by
Benson's furniture and appliance store,

122
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:45,975
and guess what?

123
00:11:58,322 --> 00:12:01,157
This is not for children's eyes.

124
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:05,494
Some years later,
that handsome young man

125
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,122
who they called "The King,"

126
00:12:08,206 --> 00:12:10,541
well, he'd sung too many songs,

127
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:13,753
had himself a heart attack,
or something.

128
00:12:14,838 --> 00:12:17,006
Must be hard being a king.

129
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:24,138
You know, it's funny how you remember
some things, but some things you can't.

130
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,768
- You do your very best now, Forrest.
- I sure will, Mama.

131
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:35,066
I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school very well.

132
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:40,321
Are you coming along?

133
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:43,908
Mama said not to be taking
rides from strangers.

134
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:46,160
This is the bus to school.

135
00:12:49,122 --> 00:12:51,374
I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

136
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:56,337
- I'm Dorothy Harris.
- Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

137
00:13:09,351 --> 00:13:11,143
This seat's taken.

138
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:15,106
It's taken!

139
00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:24,865
You can't sit here.

140
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:30,454
You know, it's funny what
a young man recollects,

141
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:32,915
'cause I don't remember being born.

142
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:36,711
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,

143
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:39,880
and I don't know when I went
on my first outdoor picnic.

144
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:44,677
But I do remember the first time I heard

145
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:47,596
the sweetest voice in the wide world.

146
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:50,474
You can sit here if you want.

147
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:57,273
I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.

148
00:13:57,983 --> 00:14:00,067
She was like an angel.

149
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:03,069
Well, are you gonna sit down,
or aren't you?

150
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:09,826
What's wrong with your legs?

151
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,164
Nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.

152
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:17,250
I just sat next to her on that bus

153
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:19,419
and had a conversation
all the way to school.

154
00:14:19,503 --> 00:14:22,213
...my back's crooked like
a question mark.

155
00:14:22,298 --> 00:14:23,465
These are going to make me...

156
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:28,303
And next to Mama, no one ever
talked to me or asked me questions.

157
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:30,805
Are you stupid or something?

158
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,892
Mama says, "Stupid is as stupid does. "

159
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,189
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

160
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:41,691
From that day on,
we was always together.

161
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:44,611
Jenny and me was like
peas and carrots.

162
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:49,824
She taught me how to climb.

163
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:52,619
Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

164
00:14:52,703 --> 00:14:55,330
I showed her how to dangle.

165
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:57,457
"... a good little monkey and... "

166
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:02,462
She helped me learn how to read,
and I showed her how to swing.

167
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,551
Sometimes we'd just sit out
and wait for the stars.

168
00:15:08,636 --> 00:15:13,556
- Mama's gonna worry about me.
- Just stay a little longer.

169
00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:18,561
For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home.

170
00:15:18,646 --> 00:15:20,730
Okay, Jenny, I'll stay.

171
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:24,317
She was my most special friend.

172
00:15:27,738 --> 00:15:29,405
My only friend.

173
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:36,996
Now, my mama always told me that
miracles happen every day.

174
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:39,457
Some people don't think so, but they do.

175
00:15:42,503 --> 00:15:44,087
Hey, dummy!

176
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:47,131
Are you retarded, or just plain stupid?

177
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:50,718
- "Look, I'm Forrest Gimp. "
Just run away, Forrest.

178
00:15:52,054 --> 00:15:55,139
Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!

179
00:15:55,224 --> 00:15:58,476
- Get the bikes!
Hurry up! Let's get him!

180
00:15:58,561 --> 00:16:01,104
- Come on!
- Look out, dummy, here we come!

181
00:16:01,188 --> 00:16:03,022
We're gonna get you!

182
00:16:03,983 --> 00:16:07,735
Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!

183
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:11,364
Come back here, you!

184
00:16:25,004 --> 00:16:27,463
Run, Forrest!

185
00:16:27,548 --> 00:16:28,965
Run!

186
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:03,040
Now, you wouldn't believe it
if I told you,

187
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,668
but I can run like the wind blows.

188
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:13,008
From that day on,
if I was going somewhere,

189
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:15,135
I was running!

190
00:17:15,219 --> 00:17:17,596
He's getting away! Stop him!

191
00:17:49,045 --> 00:17:52,047
That boy sure is a running fool.

192
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,636
Now, remember how I told you that

193
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,639
Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?

194
00:18:00,723 --> 00:18:03,809
Well, she lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.

195
00:18:03,893 --> 00:18:06,061
Her mama had gone up to heaven
when she was five,

196
00:18:06,145 --> 00:18:09,481
and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.

197
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:12,359
Jenny?

198
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:14,611
He was a very loving man.

199
00:18:15,071 --> 00:18:19,324
He was always kissing and touching
her and her sisters.

200
00:18:21,077 --> 00:18:25,497
And then this one time,
Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school.

201
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,625
Jenny, why didn't you come
to school today?

202
00:18:29,794 --> 00:18:31,670
Daddy's taking a nap.

203
00:18:31,754 --> 00:18:33,463
Jenny!
- Come on!

204
00:18:34,924 --> 00:18:37,467
Jenny, where'd you run to?

205
00:18:38,803 --> 00:18:41,471
You'd better get back here, girl!

206
00:18:42,932 --> 00:18:44,599
Where you at?

207
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:51,273
Jenny! Jenny! Where you at?

208
00:18:54,277 --> 00:18:55,610
Jenny!

209
00:18:55,695 --> 00:18:58,655
Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

210
00:18:58,781 --> 00:18:59,905
Jenny!

211
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,200
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

212
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:05,036
far, far away from here.

213
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,789
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,

214
00:19:08,874 --> 00:19:09,999
far, far away from here.

215
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,169
Mama always said
that God is mysterious.

216
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:14,420
Jenny!

217
00:19:14,504 --> 00:19:16,839
He didn't turn Jenny into a bird that day.

218
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:18,049
You'd better get back here!

219
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:19,633
Instead,

220
00:19:20,302 --> 00:19:24,847
he had the police say Jenny didn't
have to stay in that house no more.

221
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:29,018
She went to live with her grandma
just over on Creekmore Avenue,

222
00:19:29,144 --> 00:19:32,313
which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.

223
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,945
Some nights, Jenny would sneak out
and come on over to my house,

224
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,157
just 'cause she said she was scared.

225
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:45,701
Scared of what, I don't know,

226
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:49,038
but I think it was her grandma's dog.

227
00:19:49,164 --> 00:19:50,915
He was a mean dog.

228
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,376
Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends

229
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:55,753
all the way up through high school.

230
00:19:57,714 --> 00:19:59,757
- Hey, stupid!
- Quit it!

231
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:03,177
- Run, Forrest, run!
- Hey,

232
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:05,346
did you hear me, stupid?

233
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,639
- Run, Forrest!
- Come on, get in the truck!

234
00:20:06,723 --> 00:20:08,849
Get in the truck! Let's move it!

235
00:20:08,934 --> 00:20:11,685
Come on, he's getting away! Move it!

236
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,938
Run, Forrest! Run!

237
00:20:14,022 --> 00:20:17,566
You better be running, stupid!
Come on, dummy!

238
00:20:19,528 --> 00:20:23,030
- Haul ass, dummy!
- Yeah, you better get running!

239
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:27,701
Jack rabbit!

240
00:20:36,128 --> 00:20:37,378
Yeah!

241
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:40,381
Go! Go! Go!

242
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:43,717
Run, Forrest!

243
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:50,307
Now, it used to be,
I ran to get where I was going,

244
00:20:51,893 --> 00:20:54,395
I never thought it would
take me anywhere.

245
00:21:23,425 --> 00:21:27,595
- Who in the hell is that?
- That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.

246
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:30,430
Just a local idiot.

247
00:21:31,098 --> 00:21:34,601
And can you believe it?
I got to go to college, too.

248
00:21:41,192 --> 00:21:43,818
Forrest! Forrest! Run!

249
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:45,528
- Okay!
- Run!

250
00:21:45,613 --> 00:21:49,157
Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!

251
00:22:00,628 --> 00:22:04,172
You son of a bitch! Run! Go! Run!

252
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,302
No! Turn! Go!

253
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:24,150
He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,

254
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:26,110
but he sure is fast!

255
00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:34,160
Now, maybe it's just me,
but college was very confusing times.

256
00:22:35,496 --> 00:22:37,413
Federal troops enforcing a court order

257
00:22:37,498 --> 00:22:40,500
integrated the University
of Alabama today.

258
00:22:40,584 --> 00:22:41,793
Two negroes were admitted,

259
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:45,171
but only after Governor George Wallace
had carried out his symbolic threat

260
00:22:45,256 --> 00:22:46,798
to stand in the school house door.

261
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:51,552
Governor Wallace,
I take it from that statement, that...

262
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,680
Earl, what's going on?

263
00:22:53,764 --> 00:22:57,100
- Coons are trying to get into school.
- Coons?

264
00:22:57,184 --> 00:22:58,851
When raccoons try to get
on our back porch,

265
00:22:58,936 --> 00:23:00,728
Mama just chase them off with a broom.

266
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:05,358
Not raccoons, you idiot, niggers,
and they want to go to school with us.

267
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:07,902
With us? They do?

268
00:23:08,862 --> 00:23:11,364
Shortly after Governor
Wallace had carried out his promise

269
00:23:11,448 --> 00:23:12,657
to block the doorway,

270
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:14,701
President Kennedy
ordered the Secretary of Defense

271
00:23:14,785 --> 00:23:16,786
then to use military force.

272
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,580
Here, by videotape,
is the encounter by General Graham,

273
00:23:19,707 --> 00:23:22,959
commander of the National Guard,
and Governor Wallace.

274
00:23:23,043 --> 00:23:26,754
...because these National Guardsmen
are here today

275
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:29,382
as federal soldiers for Alabamans.

276
00:23:29,466 --> 00:23:33,386
They live within our borders,
they are all our brothers.

277
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,888
We are winning in this fight,

278
00:23:35,973 --> 00:23:38,975
because we are awakening
the American people

279
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,395
to the dangers that we have spoken
about so many times,

280
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:48,776
just so evident today, the trend towards
military dictatorship in this country.

281
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:54,699
And so, at day's end,
the University of Alabama

282
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:57,075
in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated

283
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,162
and students Jimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone

284
00:24:00,246 --> 00:24:03,332
had been signed up
for summer classes.

285
00:24:05,918 --> 00:24:08,754
Ma'am, you dropped your book.
Ma'am...

286
00:24:09,297 --> 00:24:11,256
Governor Wallace did what
he promised to do.

287
00:24:11,341 --> 00:24:14,885
By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob from gathering...

288
00:24:14,969 --> 00:24:17,095
Say, wasn't that Gump?

289
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:21,266
- Nah, that couldn't be.
- It sure as hell was.

290
00:24:26,022 --> 00:24:27,856
A few years later,
that angry little man

291
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,442
at the school house door
thought it would be a good idea

292
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:32,694
and ran for president.

293
00:24:35,782 --> 00:24:38,450
But somebody thought that it wasn't.

294
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:42,204
But he didn't die.

295
00:24:46,793 --> 00:24:48,460
My bus is here.

296
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,297
- Is it the number nine?
- No, it's the number four.

297
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:55,467
It was nice talking to you.

298
00:24:58,388 --> 00:25:02,474
I remember when that happened,
when Wallace got shot.

299
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:04,810
I was in college.

300
00:25:04,894 --> 00:25:06,103
Did you go to a girls' college,

301
00:25:06,187 --> 00:25:08,021
or to a girls-and-boys-together college?

302
00:25:08,147 --> 00:25:09,147
It was co-ed.

303
00:25:09,232 --> 00:25:11,942
'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.

304
00:25:12,026 --> 00:25:14,361
It was a college just for girls.

305
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:17,656
But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.

306
00:25:48,396 --> 00:25:50,021
That hurts.

307
00:26:00,783 --> 00:26:02,951
Forrest! Forrest!

308
00:26:05,204 --> 00:26:08,123
- Forrest, stop it! Stop it!
Jesus!

309
00:26:08,207 --> 00:26:09,332
What are you doing?

310
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:11,084
- He was hurting you.
- What the hell is going on here?

311
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,880
- No, he's not! Get over there!
- Who is that? Who is that?

312
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:16,047
- Billy, I'm sorry.
- What the hell?

313
00:26:16,132 --> 00:26:18,717
- Just get away from me!
- Don't...

314
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:21,761
- Don't go! Billy, wait a second!
- Get away from me.

315
00:26:21,888 --> 00:26:24,055
He doesn't know any better!

316
00:26:25,807 --> 00:26:28,476
Forrest, why did you do that?

317
00:26:31,438 --> 00:26:34,398
I brought you some chocolate.

318
00:26:34,774 --> 00:26:36,484
I'm sorry.

319
00:26:38,653 --> 00:26:41,947
- I'll go back to my college now.
- Forrest...

320
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,244
Look at you.

321
00:26:49,331 --> 00:26:51,415
Come on. Come on.

322
00:26:58,924 --> 00:27:00,799
- Is this your room?
- Shh!

323
00:27:05,263 --> 00:27:07,515
Do you ever dream, Forrest,

324
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,685
about who you're gonna be?

325
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,562
- Who I'm gonna be?
- Yeah.

326
00:27:13,647 --> 00:27:15,523
Aren't I going to be me?

327
00:27:15,607 --> 00:27:19,276
Well, you'll always be you,
just another kind of you.

328
00:27:20,195 --> 00:27:23,447
You know? I want to be famous.

329
00:27:25,158 --> 00:27:27,952
I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.

330
00:27:29,162 --> 00:27:32,289
I just want to be on an empty stage

331
00:27:32,374 --> 00:27:34,667
with my guitar, my voice.

332
00:27:36,503 --> 00:27:37,962
Just me.

333
00:27:39,464 --> 00:27:42,800
And I want to reach people
on the personal level.

334
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,806
I want to be able to say things,
just one-to-one.

335
00:27:56,314 --> 00:27:59,191
Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?

336
00:28:00,652 --> 00:28:04,488
I sit next to them in my Home
Economics class all the time.

337
00:28:33,435 --> 00:28:35,853
- I'm... Sorry.
- It's okay.

338
00:28:44,404 --> 00:28:46,113
It's all right.

339
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,118
- It's okay.
- Oh, I'm dizzy.

340
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:02,545
I bet that never happened in Home Ec.

341
00:29:07,384 --> 00:29:08,551
No.

342
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:17,894
I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.

343
00:29:17,978 --> 00:29:20,021
I don't care.
I don't like her, anyway.

344
00:29:20,105 --> 00:29:23,483
Run! Run! Run!

345
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:28,071
- Run! Run! Run!
- Run! Run! Run!

346
00:29:35,996 --> 00:29:40,208
College ran by real fast,
'cause I played so much football.

347
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:43,544
They even put me on a thing
called the All-America Team,

348
00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:47,423
where you get to meet
the President of the United States.

349
00:29:47,508 --> 00:29:49,092
President Kennedy met
with the Collegiate

350
00:29:49,176 --> 00:29:52,762
All-American Football Team
at the Oval Office today.

351
00:29:53,347 --> 00:29:55,348
Now, the really good thing
about meeting

352
00:29:55,432 --> 00:29:59,227
the President of the United States
is the food.

353
00:29:59,311 --> 00:30:02,021
They put you in this little room
with just about anything

354
00:30:02,106 --> 00:30:04,607
you'd want to eat or drink.

355
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:08,569
And since, number one,
I wasn't hungry, but thirsty,

356
00:30:08,654 --> 00:30:11,322
and number two, they was free,

357
00:30:11,448 --> 00:30:14,492
I must have drank me about
15 Dr. Peppers.

358
00:30:17,454 --> 00:30:19,580
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

359
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:21,416
It's an honor, sir.

360
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,584
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

361
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:25,294
Very good, sir.

362
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,548
Congratulations.
How does it feel to be an All-American?

363
00:30:28,632 --> 00:30:30,383
Very good, sir.

364
00:30:30,467 --> 00:30:34,137
- Congratulations. How do you feel?
- I gotta pee.

365
00:30:34,805 --> 00:30:37,098
I believe he said
he had to "go pee. "

366
00:30:52,322 --> 00:30:55,199
Sometime later,
for no particular reason,

367
00:30:55,325 --> 00:30:57,702
somebody shot that
nice young President,

368
00:30:57,828 --> 00:31:00,204
when he was riding in his car.

369
00:31:00,831 --> 00:31:04,959
And a few years after that,
somebody shot his little brother, too,

370
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:07,170
only he was in a hotel kitchen.

371
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,048
It must be hard being brothers.

372
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,259
I wouldn't know.

373
00:31:13,844 --> 00:31:15,219
Forrest Gump.

374
00:31:15,345 --> 00:31:16,596
Now can you believe it?

375
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,600
After only five years of playing football,
I got a college degree.

376
00:31:20,684 --> 00:31:22,684
Congratulations, son.

377
00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:25,520
Mama was so proud.

378
00:31:26,856 --> 00:31:30,692
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.
Here, I'll hold this for you.

379
00:31:30,818 --> 00:31:32,903
Congratulations, son.

380
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:36,031
Have you given any thought
to your future?

381
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:39,201
Thought?

382
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:42,496
Hello, I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.

383
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,582
Nobody gives a hunk of shit
who you are, fuzzball!

384
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:48,335
You're not even a low-life,
scum-sucking maggot!

385
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:52,380
Get your faggotty ass on the bus.
You're in the Army now!

386
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:54,508
This seat's taken.

387
00:31:56,385 --> 00:31:57,761
Taken.

388
00:32:00,681 --> 00:32:03,475
At first, it seemed like
I made a mistake,

389
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:05,602
seeing how it was only my induction day

390
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:08,438
and I was already getting yelled at.

391
00:32:11,526 --> 00:32:13,777
You can sit down if you want to.

392
00:32:13,903 --> 00:32:17,739
I didn't know who I might meet,
or what they might ask.

393
00:32:17,865 --> 00:32:20,450
You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

394
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:24,579
No, but I been on a real big boat.

395
00:32:25,373 --> 00:32:28,166
I'm talking about
a shrimp-catching boat.

396
00:32:28,251 --> 00:32:30,752
I've been working
on shrimp boats all my life.

397
00:32:30,878 --> 00:32:33,630
I started out on my uncle's boat,
that's my mama's brother,

398
00:32:33,756 --> 00:32:35,799
when I was about maybe nine.

399
00:32:35,925 --> 00:32:40,053
I was just looking into buying a boat
of my own and got drafted.

400
00:32:40,888 --> 00:32:45,767
My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.
People call me Bubba.

401
00:32:46,435 --> 00:32:50,063
Just like one of them old redneck boys.
Can you believe that?

402
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:53,817
My name's Forrest Gump.
People call me Forrest Gump.

403
00:32:54,777 --> 00:32:57,195
So, Bubba was from
Bayou La Batre, Alabama,

404
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,197
and his mama cooked shrimp,

405
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,327
and her mama before her
cooked shrimp,

406
00:33:04,453 --> 00:33:07,414
and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.

407
00:33:07,498 --> 00:33:08,707
Bubba's family knew everything

408
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:11,418
there was to know
about the shrimping business.

409
00:33:11,502 --> 00:33:14,546
I know everything there is to know
about the shrimping business.

410
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,632
Matter of fact, I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself

411
00:33:17,758 --> 00:33:20,093
after I get out the Army.

412
00:33:22,763 --> 00:33:23,805
Okay.

413
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:28,101
Gump! What's your sole purpose
in this Army?

414
00:33:28,185 --> 00:33:30,729
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!

415
00:33:30,813 --> 00:33:34,190
God damn it, Gump!
You're a goddamn genius!

416
00:33:34,317 --> 00:33:36,651
That's the most outstanding answer
I've ever heard.

417
00:33:36,777 --> 00:33:39,529
You must have a goddamn IQ of 160!

418
00:33:39,655 --> 00:33:42,616
You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump!

419
00:33:43,618 --> 00:33:45,493
Listen up, people!

420
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,788
Now, for some reason, I fit in
the Army like one of them round pegs.

421
00:33:49,873 --> 00:33:51,123
It's not really hard.

422
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:54,835
You just make your bed real neat
and remember to stand up straight,

423
00:33:54,961 --> 00:33:58,923
and always answer every question
with, "Yes, Drill Sergeant!"

424
00:33:59,007 --> 00:34:00,466
Is that clear?

425
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,676
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!

426
00:34:03,178 --> 00:34:06,472
What you do is, you just drag
your nets along the bottom.

427
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:10,309
On a good day, you can catch over
100 pounds of shrimp.

428
00:34:10,393 --> 00:34:13,812
If everything goes all right,
two men shrimping 10 hours,

429
00:34:13,897 --> 00:34:16,607
less what you spend on gas, you can...

430
00:34:16,691 --> 00:34:19,485
- Done, Drill Sergeant!
- Gump!

431
00:34:21,863 --> 00:34:24,615
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly, Gump?

432
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,367
You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

433
00:34:26,493 --> 00:34:29,912
Jesus H. Christ,
this is a new company record.

434
00:34:30,038 --> 00:34:32,498
If it wouldn't be a waste
of such a damn fine enlisted man,

435
00:34:32,582 --> 00:34:34,875
I'd recommend you for OCS,
Private Gump.

436
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:36,835
You are gonna be
a general some day, Gump.

437
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,005
Now, disassemble your weapon
and continue!

438
00:34:42,092 --> 00:34:45,886
Anyway, like I was saying,
shrimp is the fruit of the sea.

439
00:34:45,971 --> 00:34:50,724
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it.

440
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:53,811
There's shrimp kebabs, shrimp Creole...

441
00:34:54,104 --> 00:34:58,941
...shrimp gumbo, pan fried,
deep fried, stir fried.

442
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:02,820
There's pineapple shrimp,
lemon shrimp,

443
00:35:02,904 --> 00:35:05,239
coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp...

444
00:35:05,573 --> 00:35:11,537
...shrimp soup, shrimp stew,
shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes,

445
00:35:11,621 --> 00:35:14,665
shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich...

446
00:35:17,252 --> 00:35:19,586
That's... That's about it.

447
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:26,260
Night time in the Army
is a lonely time.

448
00:35:27,137 --> 00:35:30,764
We'd lay there in our bunks
and I'd miss my mama.

449
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:33,851
And I'd miss Jenny.

450
00:35:37,772 --> 00:35:41,650
Hey, Gump, get a load of the tits on her!

451
00:35:55,123 --> 00:35:58,250
Turns out, Jenny had gotten into
some trouble over

452
00:35:58,334 --> 00:36:01,670
some photos of her
in her college sweater,

453
00:36:01,796 --> 00:36:04,339
and she was thrown out of school.

454
00:36:07,886 --> 00:36:10,095
But that wasn't a bad thing,

455
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,766
because a man who owns
a theater in Memphis, Tennessee,

456
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:18,895
saw those photos and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.

457
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:21,522
The first chance I got,

458
00:36:21,648 --> 00:36:25,318
I took the bus up to Memphis
to see her perform in that show.

459
00:36:25,402 --> 00:36:26,903
That was Amber, Amber Flame.

460
00:36:26,987 --> 00:36:29,447
Give her a big hand, guys.
Good job, Amber.

461
00:36:29,531 --> 00:36:32,283
And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,

462
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:36,204
direct from Hollywood, California,
our very own beatnik beauty,

463
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:39,999
let's give a big round of applause
to the luscious Bobbi Dylan.

464
00:36:42,169 --> 00:36:44,420
All right!
Bobbi!

465
00:37:07,361 --> 00:37:09,445
Her dream had come true.

466
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:12,698
She was a folk singer.

467
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:24,210
Come on, baby. Shake it up.
Shake it up, now.

468
00:37:24,294 --> 00:37:25,795
Hey, buddy, get her a harmonica.

469
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,592
Hey, honey,
this ain't Captain Kangaroo.

470
00:37:31,718 --> 00:37:34,262
Hey, honey,
I got something here for you.

471
00:37:35,305 --> 00:37:39,058
- God damn it!
- Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk!

472
00:37:39,143 --> 00:37:41,602
I'm singing a song here.

473
00:37:43,939 --> 00:37:46,357
Polly, get out here!

474
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:48,151
- Shut up, there!
Don't be so shy, honey.

475
00:37:48,235 --> 00:37:49,777
Oh, shut up!

476
00:37:52,447 --> 00:37:55,199
Forrest, what are you doing here?

477
00:37:55,284 --> 00:37:56,993
- What are you doing?
Hey!

478
00:37:57,077 --> 00:37:58,452
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

479
00:37:58,579 --> 00:38:00,580
Forrest, let me down!

480
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,337
You can't keep doing this, Forrest.

481
00:38:08,422 --> 00:38:10,506
You can't keep trying
to rescue me all the time.

482
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:14,677
- They was trying to grab you.
- A lot of people try to grab me.

483
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:18,764
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.

484
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:22,185
I can't help it. I love you.

485
00:38:23,145 --> 00:38:26,647
Forrest, you don't know what love is.

486
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:36,949
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?

487
00:38:37,826 --> 00:38:42,330
We prayed for God to turn me
into a bird so I could fly far, far away?

488
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:45,666
Yes, I do.

489
00:38:49,629 --> 00:38:52,464
You think I could fly off this bridge?

490
00:38:59,138 --> 00:39:01,306
What do you mean, Jenny?

491
00:39:05,186 --> 00:39:06,686
Nothing.

492
00:39:09,649 --> 00:39:11,691
I gotta get out of here.

493
00:39:13,986 --> 00:39:15,070
Wait, Jenny...

494
00:39:15,154 --> 00:39:19,616
Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
You just stay away from me, please.

495
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,992
Can I have a ride?

496
00:39:21,077 --> 00:39:22,619
Where you going?
- I don't care.

497
00:39:22,703 --> 00:39:24,079
Get in the truck.

498
00:39:24,163 --> 00:39:25,997
So, bye-bye, Jenny.

499
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:30,835
They sending me to Vietnam.

500
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:36,007
It's this whole other country.

501
00:39:38,511 --> 00:39:40,512
Just hang on a minute.

502
00:39:41,931 --> 00:39:44,975
Listen, you promise me
something, okay?

503
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:48,395
Just, if you're ever in trouble,
don't try to be brave. You just run, okay?

504
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:50,105
Just run away.

505
00:39:51,357 --> 00:39:52,691
Okay.

506
00:39:57,571 --> 00:39:58,905
Jenny.

507
00:40:00,783 --> 00:40:03,076
I'll write you all the time.

508
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:15,213
And just like that,
she was gone.

509
00:40:31,314 --> 00:40:34,649
You come back safe to me,
do you hear?

510
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:21,904
Now, they told us that Vietnam
was gonna be very different

511
00:41:21,988 --> 00:41:24,865
from the United States of America.

512
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:29,995
And except for all the beer cans
and the barbecue, it was.

513
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:43,217
Hey, I bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.

514
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:46,470
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimpers.

515
00:41:46,554 --> 00:41:50,099
You know, after we win this war,
and we take over everything,

516
00:41:50,183 --> 00:41:51,392
we can get American shrimpers

517
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:53,227
to come out here
and shrimp these waters.

518
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:54,853
We'll just shrimp all the time, man.

519
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:58,148
So much shrimp, why,
you wouldn't believe it.

520
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:00,734
You must be my FNGs.

521
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:02,069
- Morning, sir!
- Morning, sir!

522
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:04,780
Get your hands down! Do not salute me.

523
00:42:04,864 --> 00:42:06,990
There's goddamn snipers
all around this area

524
00:42:07,075 --> 00:42:09,910
who would love to grease an officer.

525
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:13,497
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

526
00:42:14,374 --> 00:42:16,792
What's wrong with your lip?

527
00:42:16,876 --> 00:42:19,253
I was born with big gums, sir.

528
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:24,049
Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.

529
00:42:25,218 --> 00:42:26,593
Where you boys from in the world?

530
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:29,054
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!

531
00:42:29,764 --> 00:42:31,265
You twins?

532
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,769
No, we are not relations, sir.

533
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,941
Look, it's pretty basic here.

534
00:42:41,734 --> 00:42:44,194
If you stick with me
and learn from the guys

535
00:42:44,279 --> 00:42:46,947
who've been in country a while,
you'll be all right.

536
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,949
There is one item of GI gear

537
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:53,203
that can be the difference between
a live grunt and a dead grunt.

538
00:42:53,538 --> 00:42:56,707
Socks. Cushion sole, OD green.

539
00:42:56,791 --> 00:42:58,083
Try and keep your feet dry.

540
00:42:58,209 --> 00:42:59,626
When we're out humping,
I want you boys to remember

541
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,171
to change your socks whenever we stop.

542
00:43:02,255 --> 00:43:05,215
The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet
right off his legs.

543
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,593
Sergeant Sims, God damn it,

544
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:09,136
where is that sling rope
I told you to order?

545
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,138
I put in the requisitions at Battalion.

546
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:13,223
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well,
you call those sons of bitches again...

547
00:43:13,308 --> 00:43:15,851
Lieutenant Dan
sure knew his stuff.

548
00:43:15,935 --> 00:43:18,228
I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant.

549
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,441
He was from a long,
great military tradition.

550
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:25,736
Somebody in his family
had fought and died

551
00:43:26,738 --> 00:43:30,991
in every single American war.

552
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,911
- God damn it, kick some ass!
- I'm on it, Lieutenant.

553
00:43:33,995 --> 00:43:35,120
Get on it!

554
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:38,582
I guess you could say he had
a lot to live up to.

555
00:43:40,293 --> 00:43:45,129
So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
Well, I've been through there.

556
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,423
Little Rock's a fine town.

557
00:43:48,091 --> 00:43:51,677
Now, go shake down your gear,
see the platoon sergeant,

558
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:54,222
draw what you need for the field.

559
00:43:54,306 --> 00:43:58,267
If you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning right over here.

560
00:43:58,352 --> 00:44:01,229
Two standing orders in this platoon:

561
00:44:01,313 --> 00:44:03,981
One, take good care of your feet,

562
00:44:04,107 --> 00:44:09,153
two, try not to do anything stupid,
like getting yourself killed.

563
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:17,703
I sure hope I don't let him down.

564
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:31,801
I got to see
a lot of the countryside.

565
00:44:31,885 --> 00:44:34,220
We would take these real long walks.

566
00:44:42,688 --> 00:44:46,816
And we were always looking
for this guy named Charlie.

567
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:56,909
Hold it up!
Hold up, boys!

568
00:44:59,746 --> 00:45:02,081
It wasn't always fun.

569
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:06,460
Lieutenant Dan was always getting
these funny feelings about a rock,

570
00:45:06,545 --> 00:45:11,632
or a trail, or the road,
so he'd tell us to get down, shut up...

571
00:45:11,717 --> 00:45:13,718
Get down! Shut up!

572
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:16,137
...so we did.

573
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:35,865
Now, I don't know much about anything,

574
00:45:35,949 --> 00:45:39,785
but I think some of America's
best young men served in this war.

575
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,580
There was Dallas, from Phoenix,

576
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:47,084
Cleveland, he was from Detroit.

577
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:49,587
Hey, Tex. Hey, Tex.

578
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:51,881
Man, what the hell's going on?

579
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:56,302
And Tex was... Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from.

580
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:57,928
Nothing.

581
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:04,560
Fourth Platoon, on your feet.

582
00:46:04,645 --> 00:46:08,356
Still got 10 klicks to go to that river.
Move out.

583
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,232
Come on, move out.

584
00:46:12,276 --> 00:46:14,694
Step it up. Look alive out there.

585
00:46:14,779 --> 00:46:19,115
The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always some place to go.

586
00:46:19,241 --> 00:46:20,617
Fire in the hole!

587
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,414
Gump, check out that hole.

588
00:46:26,499 --> 00:46:29,501
And there was always something to do.

589
00:46:29,585 --> 00:46:32,754
- Mount them up.
Spread out! Cover his back.

590
00:46:37,802 --> 00:46:43,431
One day, it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.

591
00:46:44,433 --> 00:46:47,310
We'd been through
every kind of rain there is:

592
00:46:47,436 --> 00:46:49,979
Little bitty stinging rain,

593
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:53,358
and big old fat rain,

594
00:46:53,818 --> 00:46:56,528
rain that flew in sideways.

595
00:46:56,612 --> 00:47:00,657
And sometimes, rain even seemed
to come straight up from underneath.

596
00:47:02,451 --> 00:47:04,828
Shoot, it even rained at night.

597
00:47:05,871 --> 00:47:08,331
- Hey, Forrest.
- Hey, Bubba.

598
00:47:08,457 --> 00:47:11,751
I'm gonna lean up against you.
You just lean right back against me.

599
00:47:11,836 --> 00:47:15,672
This way, we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.

600
00:47:16,632 --> 00:47:20,093
You know why we a good partnership,
Forrest?

601
00:47:20,177 --> 00:47:22,679
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,

602
00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:24,681
like brothers and stuff.

603
00:47:26,642 --> 00:47:30,311
Hey, Forrest, there's something
I've been thinking about.

604
00:47:30,396 --> 00:47:33,398
I got a very important question
to ask you.

605
00:47:35,025 --> 00:47:38,987
How would you like to go
into the shrimping business with me?

606
00:47:40,156 --> 00:47:41,781
Okay.

607
00:47:41,866 --> 00:47:45,326
Man, I tell you what,
I got it all figured out, too.

608
00:47:45,411 --> 00:47:48,204
So many pounds of shrimp
to pay off the boat,

609
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:51,624
so many pounds for gas,
we can just live right on the boat.

610
00:47:51,709 --> 00:47:54,002
We ain't got to pay no rent.

611
00:47:54,086 --> 00:47:56,171
I'll be the captain,
we can just work it together,

612
00:47:56,255 --> 00:48:00,508
split everything right down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.

613
00:48:00,593 --> 00:48:04,179
And, hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.

614
00:48:05,723 --> 00:48:07,515
That's a fine idea.

615
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:10,727
Bubba did have a fine idea.

616
00:48:14,523 --> 00:48:17,609
I even wrote Jenny
and told her all about it.

617
00:48:18,402 --> 00:48:21,613
I sent her letters,
not every day, but almost.

618
00:48:21,697 --> 00:48:26,701
I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing,

619
00:48:26,786 --> 00:48:29,537
and told her
how I thought about her always,

620
00:48:30,873 --> 00:48:33,833
and how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her

621
00:48:33,918 --> 00:48:36,419
just as soon as she had the time.

622
00:48:38,297 --> 00:48:40,798
I'd always let her know that I was okay.

623
00:48:42,091 --> 00:48:47,262
Then, I'd sign each letter,
"Love, Forrest Gump. "

624
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:05,864
This one day, we was out walking,
like always,

625
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:08,909
and then, just like that,

626
00:49:09,828 --> 00:49:13,247
somebody turned off the rain
and the sun come out.

627
00:49:16,251 --> 00:49:18,085
Ambush!

628
00:49:18,586 --> 00:49:19,962
Take cover!

629
00:49:23,591 --> 00:49:24,758
Get down!

630
00:49:24,843 --> 00:49:26,301
Get the sixty!

631
00:49:29,472 --> 00:49:31,557
Get that pig up here, God damn it!

632
00:49:31,641 --> 00:49:33,767
Forrest, you okay?

633
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,606
Strongarm! Strongarm!
Be advised, Strongarm!

634
00:49:40,149 --> 00:49:42,568
Medic, we got a man down!

635
00:49:42,652 --> 00:49:45,612
Strongarm, this is Leg Lima 6, over!

636
00:49:46,322 --> 00:49:49,658
Roger, Strongarm, be advised
we have incoming from the tree line

637
00:49:49,784 --> 00:49:53,287
at points blue plus two.
AKs and rockets...

638
00:49:53,955 --> 00:49:55,747
Misfire! Misfire!

639
00:49:58,126 --> 00:50:00,127
God damn it! Mac!

640
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:04,506
Get that thing...
Fuck it, get it in the tree line!

641
00:50:05,466 --> 00:50:06,633
Jesus!

642
00:50:06,759 --> 00:50:08,969
My unit is down hard and hurting!

643
00:50:09,095 --> 00:50:12,639
Six are pulling back to Blue Line,
Leg Lima 6 out.

644
00:50:13,433 --> 00:50:15,392
Pull back! Pull back!

645
00:50:15,476 --> 00:50:17,603
Run! Run, Forrest!

646
00:50:17,687 --> 00:50:20,022
- Pull back!
Forrest, Forrest!

647
00:50:20,148 --> 00:50:22,733
Run, man! Run!

648
00:50:22,817 --> 00:50:24,610
Pull back! Run!

649
00:50:26,446 --> 00:50:28,655
Run, God damn it, run!

650
00:50:49,844 --> 00:50:54,473
Medic! Can I get a medic?

651
00:50:54,849 --> 00:50:58,185
I ran and ran,
just like Jenny told me to.

652
00:51:01,564 --> 00:51:05,776
I ran so far and so fast
that pretty soon I was all by myself,

653
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,818
which was a bad thing.

654
00:51:08,362 --> 00:51:09,904
Bubba!

655
00:51:12,032 --> 00:51:15,826
Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure that he was okay.

656
00:51:19,539 --> 00:51:21,582
Any friendlies out there?

657
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:24,710
Yeah, I've got
three over here.

658
00:51:25,337 --> 00:51:27,338
Where the hell are you?

659
00:51:27,923 --> 00:51:29,256
Bubba?

660
00:51:30,342 --> 00:51:33,052
And on my way back to find Bubba,

661
00:51:33,178 --> 00:51:35,972
well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.

662
00:51:36,056 --> 00:51:37,264
Tex!

663
00:51:39,351 --> 00:51:40,351
Okay.

664
00:51:40,435 --> 00:51:44,397
I couldn't just let him lay there all alone,
scared the way he was,

665
00:51:44,523 --> 00:51:48,401
so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.

666
00:52:03,542 --> 00:52:05,960
And every time I went back
looking for Bubba,

667
00:52:06,086 --> 00:52:09,588
somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest. Help me. "

668
00:52:17,264 --> 00:52:19,140
Can't hear... Can't hear...

669
00:52:21,435 --> 00:52:22,727
No sweat, man. Just lay back.

670
00:52:22,811 --> 00:52:25,312
You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

671
00:52:27,315 --> 00:52:30,359
I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.

672
00:52:30,444 --> 00:52:31,694
Over.

673
00:52:31,778 --> 00:52:35,072
Roger, Strongarm,
I know my position is danger close.

674
00:52:35,157 --> 00:52:36,991
We got Charlie all over this area.

675
00:52:37,117 --> 00:52:39,410
I gotta have those fast movers
in here now. Over.

676
00:52:39,494 --> 00:52:42,872
- Six, Strongarm, we want...
- Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!

677
00:52:42,956 --> 00:52:44,165
I know he's dead!

678
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:47,126
My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!

679
00:52:47,252 --> 00:52:48,586
- Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6.
- God damn it!

680
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,380
- Copy this transmission. Over.
- What are you doing?

681
00:52:51,465 --> 00:52:54,800
Just leave me here! Get away.
Just leave me here! Get out!

682
00:52:54,926 --> 00:52:57,219
Leg Lima 6, Strongarm.
How copy this? Over.

683
00:52:57,304 --> 00:52:59,930
God, I said leave me here, God damn it!

684
00:53:00,015 --> 00:53:03,184
Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6,
this is Strongarm, be advised

685
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,269
your fast movers
are inbound at this time, over.

686
00:53:05,353 --> 00:53:08,773
Then, it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.

687
00:53:09,649 --> 00:53:11,317
Something bit me!

688
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,326
You chink son of a bitch!

689
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:24,830
I can't leave the platoon.

690
00:53:24,956 --> 00:53:29,877
I told you to leave me there, Gump.
Forget about me. Get yourself out!

691
00:53:30,003 --> 00:53:32,129
Did you hear what I said?

692
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:34,799
God damn it, put me down!

693
00:53:35,509 --> 00:53:37,550
Get your ass out of here!

694
00:53:40,846 --> 00:53:43,431
I didn't ask you to pull me out of there,
God damn you!

695
00:53:43,516 --> 00:53:44,849
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

696
00:53:44,975 --> 00:53:46,059
To get Bubba.

697
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:50,021
I got an air strike inbound right now.
They're gonna nape the whole area.

698
00:53:50,147 --> 00:53:52,524
Gump, you stay here, God damn it!
That's an order!

699
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:55,068
I gotta find Bubba!

700
00:54:11,043 --> 00:54:12,502
Forrest.

701
00:54:20,261 --> 00:54:22,929
- Bubba.
- I'm okay, Forrest.

702
00:54:23,722 --> 00:54:25,390
I'm okay.

703
00:54:33,232 --> 00:54:35,066
Oh, Bubba, no...

704
00:54:35,192 --> 00:54:37,402
Nah, I'm gonna be all right.

705
00:54:45,578 --> 00:54:48,246
Come on. Come on. Come on.

706
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:54,752
I'm okay, Forrest.

707
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:58,923
I'm okay, man. I'm fine.

708
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:39,088
Helo's inbound.
Top smoke, get it out there!

709
00:55:40,132 --> 00:55:44,636
If I'd a known this was gonna be the
last time me and Bubba was gonna talk,

710
00:55:44,762 --> 00:55:47,055
I'd of thought of something better to say.

711
00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:48,640
Hey, Bubba.

712
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:51,142
Hey, Forrest.

713
00:55:53,479 --> 00:55:56,689
Forrest, why'd this happen?

714
00:55:58,025 --> 00:55:59,817
You got shot.

715
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:05,697
Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.

716
00:56:06,491 --> 00:56:08,158
I wanna go home.

717
00:56:10,161 --> 00:56:12,204
Bubba was my best good friend.

718
00:56:13,164 --> 00:56:17,709
And even I know that ain't something
you can find just around the corner.

719
00:56:17,835 --> 00:56:20,921
Bubba was gonna be
a shrimping boat captain,

720
00:56:21,005 --> 00:56:24,967
but instead he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.

721
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:32,975
That's all I have to say about that.

722
00:56:35,353 --> 00:56:37,521
It was a bullet, wasn't it?

723
00:56:39,857 --> 00:56:42,526
- A bullet?
- That jumped up and bit you.

724
00:56:44,904 --> 00:56:46,989
Oh, yes, sir.

725
00:56:47,073 --> 00:56:50,200
Bit me directly in the buttocks.

726
00:56:50,326 --> 00:56:55,580
They said it was a million-dollar wound,
but the Army must keep that money,

727
00:56:55,707 --> 00:56:59,543
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.

728
00:57:00,378 --> 00:57:03,880
The only good thing
about being wounded in the buttocks

729
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:05,716
is the ice cream.

730
00:57:05,842 --> 00:57:08,427
They gave me all the ice cream
I could eat.

731
00:57:08,553 --> 00:57:09,845
And guess what?

732
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:13,056
A good friend of mine
was in the bed right next door.

733
00:57:15,268 --> 00:57:18,353
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.

734
00:57:20,732 --> 00:57:22,899
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

735
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:36,913
It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

736
00:57:45,423 --> 00:57:46,757
Harper!

737
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:52,429
Cooper, Larson,

738
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,974
Webster,

739
00:57:57,393 --> 00:58:00,896
- Gump. Gump.
- I'm Forrest Gump.

740
00:58:04,442 --> 00:58:07,736
Kyle, Nichols,

741
00:58:09,947 --> 00:58:15,911
McMill, Johnson, Tyler,

742
00:58:17,246 --> 00:58:18,622
Holiday...

743
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,631
Surprise, surprise, surprise!

744
00:58:30,968 --> 00:58:33,469
Gump, how can you watch
that stupid shit?

745
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:35,137
- From the DMZ to the Delta...
- Turn it off!

746
00:58:35,222 --> 00:58:38,474
...you are tuned to the
American Forces Vietnam Network.

747
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,935
This is Channel 6, Saigon.

748
00:58:43,647 --> 00:58:45,314
Good catch, Gump.

749
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:49,443
You know how to play this?

750
00:58:50,737 --> 00:58:52,822
Come on, let me show you. Here.

751
00:58:54,908 --> 00:58:57,243
Now, the secret to this game is,

752
00:58:57,327 --> 00:59:03,165
no matter what happens,
never ever take your eye off the ball.

753
00:59:06,753 --> 00:59:08,087
All right.

754
00:59:11,425 --> 00:59:15,094
For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.

755
00:59:15,429 --> 00:59:18,347
See? Any idiot can play.

756
00:59:18,849 --> 00:59:21,600
So, I started playing it all the time.

757
00:59:22,769 --> 00:59:24,103
I played Ping-Pong

758
00:59:24,187 --> 00:59:27,481
even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.

759
00:59:35,532 --> 00:59:40,202
The hospital's people said
it made me look like a duck in water,

760
00:59:40,328 --> 00:59:42,163
whatever that means.

761
00:59:42,622 --> 00:59:45,875
Even Lieutenant Dan would come
and watch me play.

762
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:55,259
I played Ping-Pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.

763
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:08,147
Now, you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.

764
01:00:08,231 --> 01:00:11,275
Nothing just happens,
it's all part of a plan.

765
01:00:11,401 --> 01:00:14,069
I should have died out there
with my men,

766
01:00:14,196 --> 01:00:18,157
but now I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,

767
01:00:18,241 --> 01:00:21,869
a legless freak! Look! Look! Look at me!

768
01:00:22,621 --> 01:00:23,704
Do you see that?

769
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:27,583
Do you know what it's like
not to be able to use your legs?

770
01:00:30,921 --> 01:00:32,546
Yes, sir, I do.

771
01:00:36,218 --> 01:00:38,260
Did you hear what I said?

772
01:00:39,137 --> 01:00:40,888
You cheated me.

773
01:00:40,972 --> 01:00:42,139
I had a destiny.

774
01:00:42,224 --> 01:00:45,768
I was supposed to die in the field,
with honor!

775
01:00:46,436 --> 01:00:50,481
That was my destiny,
and you cheated me out of it!

776
01:01:00,116 --> 01:01:02,825
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Gump?

777
01:01:04,954 --> 01:01:08,331
This wasn't supposed to happen,
not to me.

778
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,627
I had a destiny.

779
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:18,967
I was Lieutenant Dan Taylor.

780
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:27,475
You're still Lieutenant Dan.

781
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:52,208
Look at me.

782
01:01:53,544 --> 01:02:01,217
What am I gonna do now?

783
01:02:11,604 --> 01:02:13,062
PFC Gump?

784
01:02:14,607 --> 01:02:16,024
Yes, sir!

785
01:02:16,692 --> 01:02:18,192
As you were.

786
01:02:18,694 --> 01:02:22,530
Son, you've been awarded
the Medal of Honor.

787
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:27,201
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan,
they want to give me a...

788
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:37,712
Ma'am, what'd they do
with Lieutenant Dan?

789
01:02:38,631 --> 01:02:40,423
They sent him home.

790
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:49,182
Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.

791
01:02:50,225 --> 01:02:53,770
The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech by the President

792
01:02:53,854 --> 01:02:57,231
regarding the need for further escalation
of the war in Vietnam.

793
01:02:57,316 --> 01:02:59,442
President Johnson awarded
four Medals of Honor

794
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:01,194
to men
from each of the Armed Services.

795
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:04,197
America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.

796
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,994
I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?

797
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:13,247
- In the buttocks, sir.
- That must be a sight.

798
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:16,292
I'd kind of like to see that.

799
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:31,890
God damn, son.

800
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:37,854
After that,
Mama went to the hotel to lay down,

801
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:41,441
so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.

802
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,068
Hilary, all right,
I've got the vets,

803
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:44,653
what do you want me to do with them?

804
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:46,488
What are you doing here
so late?

805
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:50,617
It's a good thing Mama was resting,
'cause the streets was awful crowded

806
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:53,870
with people looking
at all the statues and monuments,

807
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:56,581
and some of them people were loud
and pushy.

808
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,626
Okay, follow me! Come on.
Let's move it out.

809
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:03,422
Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.

810
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,218
Follow me, let's go!

811
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,638
Come on. Let's go.

812
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,271
Stand here.

813
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:24,901
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this. Good!

814
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,320
Okay.

815
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:31,491
There was this man giving a little talk.

816
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:35,078
And for some reason, he was
wearing an American flag for a shirt.

817
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,621
Now, I'm gonna
bring up some soldiers...

818
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,499
And he liked to say the "F" word.

819
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:42,961
A lot. "F" this and "F" that.

820
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,380
And every time he said the "F" word,

821
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:48,216
people, for some reason,
well, they'd cheer.

822
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,927
...where to stick this fucking war! Yeah!

823
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,765
Yeah! Yeah!

824
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:57,851
Come on, man, come up here, man.

825
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:01,605
Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move, move.

826
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:06,026
You can do it. Just get up there.
Go on. That's it.

827
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:21,374
Tell us a little bit about the war, man.

828
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,210
The war in Vietnam?

829
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:26,213
- The war in Viet-fucking-nam!
- Yeah!

830
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:47,651
Peace!

831
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,402
Come on, man, go!

832
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:51,655
Come on!
Peace!

833
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:52,781
Well...

834
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:56,326
There was only one thing
I could say about the war in Vietnam.

835
01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:01,247
...there's only one thing
I can say about the war in Vietnam.

836
01:06:05,043 --> 01:06:08,838
In Vietnam, your...

837
01:06:18,598 --> 01:06:19,682
Hey, what the hell are you...

838
01:06:19,766 --> 01:06:22,518
I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!

839
01:06:22,602 --> 01:06:25,104
Jesus Christ, what'd they do with this?

840
01:06:26,523 --> 01:06:28,190
We can't hear you!

841
01:06:29,901 --> 01:06:31,902
We can't hear anything!

842
01:06:32,612 --> 01:06:35,114
- This one! This one! Give me that!
Turn it up!

843
01:06:35,198 --> 01:06:36,615
Speak up!

844
01:06:37,409 --> 01:06:38,868
That's it!

845
01:06:39,953 --> 01:06:42,788
...and that's all I have to say about that.

846
01:06:50,088 --> 01:06:53,048
That's so right on, man. You said it all.

847
01:06:54,551 --> 01:06:57,052
What's your name, man?

848
01:06:57,137 --> 01:06:59,763
My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.

849
01:07:00,974 --> 01:07:02,141
Forrest Gump!

850
01:07:02,267 --> 01:07:03,642
- Gump!
- Gump!

851
01:07:05,145 --> 01:07:08,898
Forrest! Forrest!

852
01:07:12,944 --> 01:07:15,321
- Jenny!
- Forrest!

853
01:07:32,088 --> 01:07:34,757
Hey! Hey!

854
01:07:42,849 --> 01:07:45,976
It was the happiest moment of my life.

855
01:07:48,313 --> 01:07:51,690
Jenny and me were just like
peas and carrots again.

856
01:07:53,026 --> 01:07:54,610
She showed me around,

857
01:07:54,694 --> 01:07:57,279
and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.

858
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:58,697
Shut that blind, man.

859
01:07:58,823 --> 01:08:01,033
And get your white ass
away from that window.

860
01:08:01,117 --> 01:08:03,202
Don't you know we in a war here?

861
01:08:04,037 --> 01:08:05,454
Hey, man, he's cool. He's cool.
He's one of us.

862
01:08:05,538 --> 01:08:07,456
- Let me tell you about us.
- Where the hell have you been?

863
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:09,625
Our purpose here
is to protect our black leaders

864
01:08:09,709 --> 01:08:11,460
from the racial onslaught of the pig

865
01:08:11,544 --> 01:08:13,629
who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,

866
01:08:13,713 --> 01:08:17,049
rape our women,
and destroy our black communities.

867
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,887
Who's the baby killer?

868
01:08:22,013 --> 01:08:24,723
This is my good friend I told you about.
This is Forrest Gump.

869
01:08:24,808 --> 01:08:26,557
Forrest, this is Wesley.

870
01:08:26,642 --> 01:08:27,934
Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley,

871
01:08:28,018 --> 01:08:30,645
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.

872
01:08:30,729 --> 01:08:32,146
Let me tell you something else.

873
01:08:32,231 --> 01:08:36,484
We are here to offer protection and help
for all of those who need our help,

874
01:08:36,568 --> 01:08:40,154
because we, the Black Panthers,
are against the war in Vietnam.

875
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:43,908
Yes, we are against any war where
black soldiers are sent to the frontline

876
01:08:43,993 --> 01:08:45,910
to die for a country that hates them.

877
01:08:45,995 --> 01:08:49,163
Yes, we are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight

878
01:08:49,248 --> 01:08:52,333
and come to be brutalized and killed
in their own communities

879
01:08:52,418 --> 01:08:54,002
as they sleep in their beds at night.

880
01:08:54,086 --> 01:08:55,253
You are a fucking asshole!

881
01:08:55,337 --> 01:08:58,715
Yes, we are against all these racist
and imperial dog acts.

882
01:09:08,017 --> 01:09:11,227
Forrest! Quit it! Quit it!

883
01:09:13,188 --> 01:09:14,439
Forrest!

884
01:09:15,024 --> 01:09:16,774
Stop it! Stop it!

885
01:09:23,407 --> 01:09:24,782
Oh, God...

886
01:09:25,617 --> 01:09:28,036
I shouldn't have brought you here.

887
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:31,748
I should have known it was just
gonna be some bullshit hassle.

888
01:09:32,916 --> 01:09:35,543
He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

889
01:09:40,466 --> 01:09:42,216
Come on, Forrest.

890
01:09:47,931 --> 01:09:51,934
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.

891
01:09:54,813 --> 01:09:57,148
He doesn't mean it when
he does things like this. He doesn't.

892
01:09:57,232 --> 01:09:59,567
I would never hurt you, Jenny.

893
01:10:01,403 --> 01:10:03,654
I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

894
01:10:05,574 --> 01:10:08,159
I wanted to be your boyfriend.

895
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:21,089
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.

896
01:10:22,466 --> 01:10:25,676
You look handsome in it. You do.

897
01:10:29,765 --> 01:10:31,682
- You know what?
- What?

898
01:10:35,312 --> 01:10:38,940
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.

899
01:10:40,526 --> 01:10:42,276
Me, too, Forrest.

900
01:10:42,361 --> 01:10:47,031
We walked around all night,
Jenny and me, just talking.

901
01:10:49,118 --> 01:10:52,286
She told me about
all the traveling she'd done.

902
01:10:52,371 --> 01:10:56,957
And how she'd discovered ways
to expand her mind

903
01:10:57,041 --> 01:11:00,127
and learn how to live in harmony,

904
01:11:00,211 --> 01:11:02,546
which must be out west somewhere,

905
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:04,965
'cause she made it
all the way to California.

906
01:11:05,049 --> 01:11:07,300
Try to love one another right now

907
01:11:07,385 --> 01:11:08,552
Hey!

908
01:11:09,512 --> 01:11:12,055
Anybody want to go to San Francisco?

909
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,015
- I'll go.
- Far out.

910
01:11:15,476 --> 01:11:18,645
It was a very special night
for the two of us.

911
01:11:20,231 --> 01:11:22,315
I didn't want it to end.

912
01:11:23,109 --> 01:11:25,527
I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

913
01:11:26,529 --> 01:11:28,321
I have to, Forrest.

914
01:11:29,323 --> 01:11:30,574
Jenny?

915
01:11:32,743 --> 01:11:35,328
Things got a little out of hand.

916
01:11:35,413 --> 01:11:39,249
It's just this war
and that lying son of a bitch, Johnson!

917
01:11:40,918 --> 01:11:43,712
I would never hurt you, you know that.

918
01:11:46,841 --> 01:11:48,842
You know what I think?

919
01:11:50,344 --> 01:11:55,599
I think you should go home
to Greenbow, Alabama!

920
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:11,198
Forrest, we have very different lives,
you know.

921
01:12:20,625 --> 01:12:23,793
I want you to have this.

922
01:12:28,466 --> 01:12:30,634
Forrest, I can't keep this.

923
01:12:32,303 --> 01:12:36,556
I got it just by doing
what you told me to do.

924
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:40,769
Why are you so good to me?

925
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:43,813
You're my girl.

926
01:12:45,816 --> 01:12:47,943
I'll always be your girl.

927
01:13:28,358 --> 01:13:33,195
And just like that,
she was gone, out of my life again.

928
01:13:34,698 --> 01:13:37,032
That's one small step for man,

929
01:13:39,035 --> 01:13:41,870
one giant leap for mankind.

930
01:13:47,544 --> 01:13:50,045
I thought I was
going back to Vietnam,

931
01:13:50,171 --> 01:13:53,382
but instead, they decided the best way
for me to fight the Communists

932
01:13:53,466 --> 01:13:55,092
was to play Ping-Pong.

933
01:13:55,176 --> 01:13:57,469
So, I was in the Special Services,

934
01:13:57,554 --> 01:14:00,806
traveling around the country
cheering up all them wounded veterans

935
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:03,309
and showing them
how to play Ping-Pong.

936
01:14:03,393 --> 01:14:05,311
I was so good that some years later

937
01:14:05,395 --> 01:14:09,023
the Army decided that I should be
on the All-American Ping-Pong team.

938
01:14:09,649 --> 01:14:12,067
We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China

939
01:14:12,152 --> 01:14:14,570
in like a million years,
or something like that.

940
01:14:14,696 --> 01:14:18,115
Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,

941
01:14:18,199 --> 01:14:20,993
but all I did was play Ping-Pong.

942
01:14:21,077 --> 01:14:24,163
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity.

943
01:14:24,873 --> 01:14:27,166
Famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.

944
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:29,918
Here he is, Forrest Gump, right here.

945
01:14:36,676 --> 01:14:38,427
Mr. Gump, have a seat.

946
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:43,098
Forrest Gump, John Lennon.

947
01:14:43,767 --> 01:14:45,017
- Welcome home.
- You had quite a trip.

948
01:14:45,101 --> 01:14:48,437
Can you tell us, what was China like?

949
01:14:51,691 --> 01:14:56,945
In the land of China,
people hardly got nothing at all.

950
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:58,614
No possessions?

951
01:15:01,242 --> 01:15:04,453
And in China, they never go to church.

952
01:15:05,747 --> 01:15:07,289
No religion, too?

953
01:15:07,374 --> 01:15:08,374
Oh.

954
01:15:09,376 --> 01:15:12,669
- Hard to imagine.
- Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.

955
01:15:14,464 --> 01:15:16,840
Some years later,
that nice young man from England

956
01:15:16,925 --> 01:15:19,551
was on his way home
to see his little boy

957
01:15:19,636 --> 01:15:22,638
and was signing some autographs,

958
01:15:22,764 --> 01:15:26,725
and for no particular reason at all,
somebody shot him.

959
01:15:29,771 --> 01:15:33,607
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

960
01:15:34,901 --> 01:15:36,985
Now, that's Lieutenant Dan.

961
01:15:39,781 --> 01:15:41,407
Lieutenant Dan!

962
01:15:41,491 --> 01:15:45,953
They gave you
the Congressional Medal of Honor!

963
01:15:47,831 --> 01:15:49,331
Yes, sir, they surely did.

964
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:51,416
They gave you,

965
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:55,670
an imbecile,
a moron who goes on television

966
01:15:55,754 --> 01:16:00,007
and makes a fool out of himself
in front of the whole damn country,

967
01:16:00,676 --> 01:16:03,177
the Congressional Medal of Honor.

968
01:16:04,346 --> 01:16:05,513
Yes, sir.

969
01:16:07,683 --> 01:16:10,518
Well, then, that's just perfect!

970
01:16:12,438 --> 01:16:14,772
Yeah, well,
I just got one thing to say to that.

971
01:16:14,857 --> 01:16:17,108
God damn bless America.

972
01:16:18,026 --> 01:16:19,318
Hey!

973
01:16:21,113 --> 01:16:22,447
Oh, God!

974
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:27,368
- Oh, God!
- Lieutenant Dan!

975
01:16:28,495 --> 01:16:31,247
Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel.

976
01:16:31,331 --> 01:16:33,291
And because he didn't have no legs,

977
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:36,544
he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.

978
01:16:39,423 --> 01:16:41,883
Take a right. Take a right.

979
01:16:44,511 --> 01:16:47,054
Hey! Come on, already!

980
01:16:47,139 --> 01:16:49,932
What do you do here in New York,
Lieutenant Dan?

981
01:16:50,017 --> 01:16:52,560
I'm living off the government tit.

982
01:16:54,188 --> 01:16:55,563
Sucking it dry!

983
01:16:55,647 --> 01:16:57,690
Hey! Hey! Hey! Are you blind?

984
01:16:57,774 --> 01:16:59,484
- I'm walking here!
- Get out of the way!

985
01:16:59,568 --> 01:17:02,153
Get out! Come on, go! Go! Go!

986
01:17:09,203 --> 01:17:12,955
I stayed with Lieutenant Dan
and celebrated the holidays.

987
01:17:17,377 --> 01:17:20,796
You have a great year.
Hurry home and God bless you.

988
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,594
Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

989
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:30,848
I didn't know I was supposed to be
looking for him, sir.

990
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:41,817
That's all these cripples,
down at the VA,

991
01:17:41,902 --> 01:17:44,320
that's all they ever talk about.

992
01:17:45,489 --> 01:17:48,449
Jesus this and Jesus that.

993
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:52,203
Have I found Jesus?

994
01:17:52,829 --> 01:17:55,831
They even had a priest come
and talk to me.

995
01:17:56,708 --> 01:18:01,379
He said God is listening,
but I have to help myself.

996
01:18:02,756 --> 01:18:05,049
How if I accept Jesus into my heart,

997
01:18:06,051 --> 01:18:09,845
I'll get to walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

998
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:12,098
Did you hear what I said?

999
01:18:13,141 --> 01:18:17,144
Walk beside him
in the kingdom of heaven.

1000
01:18:17,229 --> 01:18:20,188
Well, kiss my crippled ass.

1001
01:18:20,273 --> 01:18:23,650
God is listening? What a crock of shit.

1002
01:18:27,321 --> 01:18:29,948
I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

1003
01:18:31,867 --> 01:18:32,909
Oh?

1004
01:18:37,748 --> 01:18:39,124
Well,

1005
01:18:42,086 --> 01:18:45,463
before you go, why don't you get
your ass down to the corner

1006
01:18:45,548 --> 01:18:48,049
- and get us another bottle of Ripple.
- Yes, sir.

1007
01:18:48,134 --> 01:18:53,263
We are at approximately 45th Street
in New York City at One Astor Plaza.

1008
01:18:53,347 --> 01:18:55,181
This is the site of the old Astor Hotel.

1009
01:18:55,266 --> 01:18:57,475
What the hell
is in Bayou La Batre?

1010
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,894
Shrimping boats.
Shrimping boats?

1011
01:18:59,979 --> 01:19:02,397
Who gives a shit
about shrimping boats?

1012
01:19:02,481 --> 01:19:03,940
I gotta buy me
one of them shrimping boats,

1013
01:19:04,025 --> 01:19:05,567
soon as I have some money.

1014
01:19:05,651 --> 01:19:08,486
I made me a promise to Bubba
in Vietnam

1015
01:19:08,571 --> 01:19:11,281
that as soon as the war was over,
we'd go in partners.

1016
01:19:11,365 --> 01:19:14,784
He'd be the captain of the
shrimping boat and I'd be his first mate.

1017
01:19:14,869 --> 01:19:18,330
But now that he's dead,
that means I gotta be the captain.

1018
01:19:18,414 --> 01:19:21,124
- A shrimp boat captain.
- Yes, sir.

1019
01:19:21,208 --> 01:19:23,668
A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.

1020
01:19:25,463 --> 01:19:27,922
Now hear this!

1021
01:19:28,674 --> 01:19:32,510
Private Gump here
is gonna be a shrimp boat captain.

1022
01:19:33,262 --> 01:19:34,679
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan,

1023
01:19:34,764 --> 01:19:37,223
the day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,

1024
01:19:37,308 --> 01:19:40,852
- I will come and be your first mate.
- Okay.

1025
01:19:40,936 --> 01:19:45,273
If you're ever a shrimp boat captain,
that's the day I'm an astronaut.

1026
01:19:45,358 --> 01:19:48,360
Danny, what are you
complaining about?

1027
01:19:48,444 --> 01:19:51,029
- What are you doing, hon?
- Mr. Hot Wheels.

1028
01:19:51,113 --> 01:19:54,741
- Who's your friend?
- My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.

1029
01:19:55,576 --> 01:19:59,788
This is Cunning Carla
and Long-Limbs Lenore.

1030
01:20:00,873 --> 01:20:04,084
So, where you been, baby cakes, huh?
Haven't seen you around lately.

1031
01:20:04,168 --> 01:20:05,627
You know, you should have
been here for Christmas,

1032
01:20:05,711 --> 01:20:07,045
'cause Tommy bought a round
on the house

1033
01:20:07,129 --> 01:20:08,630
and gave everybody a turkey sandwich.

1034
01:20:08,714 --> 01:20:11,758
Well, well, I had company.

1035
01:20:12,635 --> 01:20:16,304
Hey, hey! We was just there.
That's at Times Square.

1036
01:20:16,931 --> 01:20:21,059
Don't you just love New Year's?
You get to start all over.

1037
01:20:21,143 --> 01:20:24,437
Hey, Lenore...
- Everybody gets a second chance.

1038
01:20:24,522 --> 01:20:27,065
It's funny,
but in the middle of all that fun,

1039
01:20:27,149 --> 01:20:29,442
I began to think about Jenny,

1040
01:20:30,361 --> 01:20:34,823
wondering how she was spending
her New Year's night out in California.

1041
01:20:57,429 --> 01:21:00,931
Eight, seven, six, five,

1042
01:21:01,057 --> 01:21:04,518
four, three, two, one!

1043
01:21:04,644 --> 01:21:07,312
Happy New Year!

1044
01:21:23,788 --> 01:21:26,498
Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!

1045
01:22:01,785 --> 01:22:05,454
What are you, stupid or something?
What's your problem?

1046
01:22:06,122 --> 01:22:07,539
What's his problem?

1047
01:22:07,624 --> 01:22:09,875
Did you lose your pecker in the war
or something?

1048
01:22:09,959 --> 01:22:12,002
What, is your friend stupid
or something?

1049
01:22:12,086 --> 01:22:13,170
What did you say?

1050
01:22:13,254 --> 01:22:14,671
I said, is your friend stupid
or something?

1051
01:22:14,756 --> 01:22:16,924
Hey! Don't call him stupid!

1052
01:22:17,008 --> 01:22:18,967
Hey, don't you push her!
You shut up!

1053
01:22:19,052 --> 01:22:21,094
- Don't you ever call him stupid!
What's the matter, baby?

1054
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:22,888
- Why are you so upset?
Just get the hell out of here.

1055
01:22:22,972 --> 01:22:24,056
- Stupid damn...
- Get your goddamn clothes...

1056
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,641
You belong in Ripley's Believe It Or Not!

1057
01:22:25,725 --> 01:22:27,601
- Get the hell out of here!
- You should be in a sideshow!

1058
01:22:27,685 --> 01:22:28,727
Go on! Get out of here!

1059
01:22:28,812 --> 01:22:30,103
Come on, Lenore.
We don't need this shit!

1060
01:22:30,188 --> 01:22:31,563
Get out of here!

1061
01:22:33,191 --> 01:22:35,734
- You retard.
- Loser. You freak.

1062
01:22:41,115 --> 01:22:42,324
No, no.

1063
01:23:07,475 --> 01:23:11,436
I'm sorry I ruined your
New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan.

1064
01:23:12,021 --> 01:23:14,314
She tasted like cigarettes.

1065
01:23:30,497 --> 01:23:32,039
I guess Lieutenant Dan figured

1066
01:23:32,124 --> 01:23:34,959
there's some things
you just can't change.

1067
01:23:35,085 --> 01:23:40,214
He didn't want to be called crippled,
just like I didn't want to be called stupid.

1068
01:23:45,721 --> 01:23:47,597
Happy New Year, Gump.

1069
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:53,769
The US Ping-Pong team

1070
01:23:53,854 --> 01:23:56,147
met with President Nixon today
at an Oval Office ceremony...

1071
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:58,983
And wouldn't you know it?
A few months later,

1072
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:03,029
they invited me and the Ping-Pong team
to visit the White House.

1073
01:24:03,113 --> 01:24:05,364
So, I went, again.

1074
01:24:06,199 --> 01:24:09,660
And I met the President
of the United States, again.

1075
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:13,372
Only, this time, they didn't get us rooms
in a real fancy hotel.

1076
01:24:13,457 --> 01:24:16,834
So, are you enjoying yourself
in our nation's capital, young man?

1077
01:24:16,919 --> 01:24:19,921
- Yes, sir.
- Well, where are you staying?

1078
01:24:20,005 --> 01:24:22,632
- It's called the Hotel Ebbott.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1079
01:24:22,716 --> 01:24:25,843
I know of a much nicer hotel.
It's brand-new, very modern.

1080
01:24:25,928 --> 01:24:27,929
I'll have my people
take care of it for you.

1081
01:24:28,555 --> 01:24:29,680
Security, Frank Wills.

1082
01:24:29,765 --> 01:24:33,351
Yeah, sir, you might want
to send a maintenance man

1083
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:36,103
over to that office across the way.

1084
01:24:36,188 --> 01:24:39,065
The lights are off, and they must be
looking for a fuse box or something,

1085
01:24:39,149 --> 01:24:41,859
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.

1086
01:24:41,944 --> 01:24:43,569
Okay, sir. I'll check it out.

1087
01:24:43,654 --> 01:24:45,363
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1088
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:47,365
- Good night.
- Good night.

1089
01:24:50,994 --> 01:24:56,374
Therefore, I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.

1090
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:58,501
Vice President Ford

1091
01:24:58,585 --> 01:25:03,089
will be sworn in as president
at that hour in this office.

1092
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:09,261
As I recall the high hopes for America
with which we began this second term...

1093
01:25:14,518 --> 01:25:16,060
Sergeant Gump.

1094
01:25:16,561 --> 01:25:18,771
- Yes, sir!
- As you were.

1095
01:25:18,855 --> 01:25:21,983
I have your discharge papers.
Your service is up, son.

1096
01:25:25,404 --> 01:25:28,155
Does this mean
I can't play Ping-Pong no more?

1097
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,199
For the Army it does.

1098
01:25:32,828 --> 01:25:37,707
And just like that, my service
in the United States Army was over.

1099
01:25:43,005 --> 01:25:44,796
So, I went home.

1100
01:26:06,277 --> 01:26:09,696
- I'm home, Mama.
- I know, I know.

1101
01:26:11,323 --> 01:26:12,866
- Louise, he's here.
Now, when I got home,

1102
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:16,995
I had no idea,
but Mama had had all sorts of visitors.

1103
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:19,414
We've had all sorts of visitors, Forrest.

1104
01:26:19,498 --> 01:26:22,584
Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.

1105
01:26:22,668 --> 01:26:26,463
One man even left a check for $25,000

1106
01:26:26,547 --> 01:26:30,008
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you liked using their paddle.

1107
01:26:30,134 --> 01:26:32,802
Oh, but, Mama,
I only like using my own paddle.

1108
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:34,888
- Hi, Miss Louise.
- Hey, Forrest.

1109
01:26:34,972 --> 01:26:37,891
I know that. I know that.

1110
01:26:37,975 --> 01:26:40,643
But it's $25,000, Forrest.

1111
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:45,398
I thought maybe you could hold it
for a while, see if it grows on you.

1112
01:26:45,483 --> 01:26:47,609
- Oh, you look good, Forrest.
- That Mama, she sure was right.

1113
01:26:47,693 --> 01:26:50,195
- You look real good.
- It's funny how things work out.

1114
01:26:50,321 --> 01:26:53,448
I didn't stay home for long,
because I'd made a promise to Bubba,

1115
01:26:53,532 --> 01:26:55,784
and I always try to keep my promise.

1116
01:26:55,868 --> 01:26:57,410
So, I went on down to Bayou La Batre

1117
01:26:57,495 --> 01:27:01,247
to meet Bubba's family
and make their introduction.

1118
01:27:01,332 --> 01:27:05,001
Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?

1119
01:27:05,711 --> 01:27:07,962
Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

1120
01:27:08,047 --> 01:27:09,422
I guess.

1121
01:27:10,424 --> 01:27:14,010
And, of course,
I paid my respect to Bubba himself.

1122
01:27:16,013 --> 01:27:18,556
Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump.

1123
01:27:21,685 --> 01:27:25,730
I remember everything you said,
and I got it all figured out.

1124
01:27:28,526 --> 01:27:35,323
I'm taking the $24,562
and 47 cents that I got...

1125
01:27:36,408 --> 01:27:39,994
Or, that's left after a new hair cut
and a new suit,

1126
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:42,038
and I took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,

1127
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:45,375
and I bought a bus ticket
and three Dr. Peppers.

1128
01:27:45,918 --> 01:27:47,710
Tell me something.

1129
01:27:48,754 --> 01:27:50,880
Are you stupid
or something?

1130
01:27:50,965 --> 01:27:53,007
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

1131
01:27:53,092 --> 01:27:56,052
Well, that's what's left after me saying,

1132
01:27:56,971 --> 01:27:59,097
"When I was in China
on the All-America Ping-Pong team,

1133
01:27:59,223 --> 01:28:03,017
"I just loved playing Ping-Pong with
my Flex-O-Light Ping-Pong paddle,"

1134
01:28:03,102 --> 01:28:04,352
which everybody knows isn't true,

1135
01:28:04,436 --> 01:28:05,812
but Mama says it's just a little white lie

1136
01:28:05,896 --> 01:28:08,064
so it wouldn't hurt nobody.

1137
01:28:09,483 --> 01:28:15,404
So, anyway, I'm putting all that on gas,
ropes and new nets

1138
01:28:16,156 --> 01:28:17,906
and a brand-new shrimping boat.

1139
01:28:39,596 --> 01:28:42,848
Now, Bubba had told me everything
he knew about shrimping,

1140
01:28:42,932 --> 01:28:45,267
but you know what I found out?

1141
01:28:46,936 --> 01:28:49,271
Shrimping is tough.

1142
01:28:51,482 --> 01:28:53,317
I only caught five.

1143
01:28:53,443 --> 01:28:55,277
A couple more,
you could have yourself a cocktail.

1144
01:29:00,116 --> 01:29:01,867
Hey, you ever think
about naming this old boat?

1145
01:29:01,951 --> 01:29:04,620
It's bad luck
to have a boat without a name.

1146
01:29:06,998 --> 01:29:11,835
I'd never named a boat before,
but there was only one I could think of,

1147
01:29:13,004 --> 01:29:16,215
the most beautiful name
in the wide world.

1148
01:29:37,237 --> 01:29:40,072
Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny
in a long while,

1149
01:29:40,156 --> 01:29:42,699
but I thought about her a lot,

1150
01:29:42,825 --> 01:29:46,286
and I hoped that whatever
she was doing made her happy.

1151
01:31:32,559 --> 01:31:35,102
I thought about Jenny all the time.

1152
01:31:59,753 --> 01:32:00,920
Hey!

1153
01:32:24,778 --> 01:32:29,448
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?

1154
01:32:29,533 --> 01:32:33,452
Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs.

1155
01:32:33,537 --> 01:32:37,289
But you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.

1156
01:32:37,374 --> 01:32:39,667
Yes, I know that.

1157
01:32:40,001 --> 01:32:42,044
You wrote me a letter, you idiot.

1158
01:32:42,170 --> 01:32:46,715
Well, well. Captain Forrest Gump.
I had to see this for myself.

1159
01:32:48,343 --> 01:32:55,224
And I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain

1160
01:32:55,350 --> 01:32:57,935
that I'd be your first mate.
Well, here I am.

1161
01:32:58,019 --> 01:33:01,147
- I am a man of my word.
- Okay.

1162
01:33:01,231 --> 01:33:05,234
Yeah, but don't you be thinking that
I'm going to be calling you "sir. "

1163
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:06,694
No, sir.

1164
01:33:15,578 --> 01:33:17,871
That's my boat.

1165
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:25,920
I have a feeling if we head
due east, we'll find some shrimp,

1166
01:33:26,046 --> 01:33:27,630
so take a left.

1167
01:33:29,049 --> 01:33:31,968
- Take a left!
- Which way?

1168
01:33:32,052 --> 01:33:34,721
Over there! They're over there!

1169
01:33:35,389 --> 01:33:39,225
- Get on the wheel and take a left!
- Okay.

1170
01:33:40,436 --> 01:33:44,564
Gump, what are you doing?
Take a left! Left!

1171
01:33:46,942 --> 01:33:50,570
That's where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!

1172
01:33:52,156 --> 01:33:53,740
That's where we'll find them.

1173
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:10,548
- Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
- Okay, so I was wrong.

1174
01:34:11,258 --> 01:34:14,469
How are we going to find them?

1175
01:34:14,595 --> 01:34:17,096
Well, maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.

1176
01:34:23,729 --> 01:34:26,397
So, I went to church every Sunday.

1177
01:34:27,650 --> 01:34:29,651
Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,

1178
01:34:29,777 --> 01:34:32,779
though I think
he left the praying up to me.

1179
01:34:48,254 --> 01:34:52,632
- No shrimp.
- Where the hell's this God of yours?

1180
01:34:53,467 --> 01:34:59,180
It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that,
'cause right then, God showed up.

1181
01:35:16,031 --> 01:35:20,868
You'll never sink this boat!
- Now, me, I was scared,

1182
01:35:20,995 --> 01:35:24,038
but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.

1183
01:35:24,164 --> 01:35:25,498
Come on!

1184
01:35:28,627 --> 01:35:33,840
You call this a storm?
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1185
01:35:35,968 --> 01:35:40,345
It's time for a showdown! You and me!

1186
01:35:40,471 --> 01:35:44,349
I'm right here! Come and get me!

1187
01:35:46,144 --> 01:35:50,022
You'll never sink this boat!

1188
01:35:52,066 --> 01:35:54,234
Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,

1189
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:56,903
destroying nearly everything in its path.

1190
01:35:57,030 --> 01:35:59,531
And as in other towns
up and down the coast,

1191
01:35:59,699 --> 01:36:02,075
Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry

1192
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:06,038
has fallen victim to Carmen
and has been left in utter ruin.

1193
01:36:06,164 --> 01:36:09,291
Speaking with local officials,
this reporter has learned,

1194
01:36:09,375 --> 01:36:12,836
in fact, only one shrimping boat
actually survived the storm.

1195
01:36:13,212 --> 01:36:15,839
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.

1196
01:36:16,549 --> 01:36:18,550
After that,
shrimping was easy.

1197
01:36:24,223 --> 01:36:27,351
Since people still needed
them shrimps for shrimp cocktails

1198
01:36:27,435 --> 01:36:31,563
and barbecues and all,
and we were the only boat left standing,

1199
01:36:31,731 --> 01:36:34,983
Bubba-Gump Shrimp's what they got.

1200
01:36:35,068 --> 01:36:39,655
We got a whole bunch of boats,
12 Jennys,

1201
01:36:39,739 --> 01:36:43,241
a big old warehouse. We even have
hats that say "Bubba-Gump" on them.

1202
01:36:43,576 --> 01:36:46,870
Bubba-Gump Shrimp.
It's a household name.

1203
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:48,789
Hold on there, boy.

1204
01:36:48,915 --> 01:36:53,460
Are you telling me you're the owner of
the Bubba-Gump Shrimp Corporation?

1205
01:36:53,586 --> 01:36:56,588
Yes, sir. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.

1206
01:36:58,216 --> 01:37:02,260
Boy, I heard some whoppers in my time,
but that tops them all.

1207
01:37:04,972 --> 01:37:07,766
We was sitting next to a millionaire.

1208
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:15,899
Well, I thought it was a very lovely story,

1209
01:37:16,317 --> 01:37:20,946
and you tell it so well,
with such enthusiasm.

1210
01:37:22,657 --> 01:37:25,325
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?

1211
01:37:25,451 --> 01:37:26,952
Well, yes, I would.

1212
01:37:31,958 --> 01:37:34,000
That's him right there.

1213
01:37:36,337 --> 01:37:38,588
And let me tell you something
about Lieutenant Dan...

1214
01:37:39,757 --> 01:37:40,799
Forrest,

1215
01:37:46,347 --> 01:37:49,141
I never thanked you for saving my life.

1216
01:38:15,167 --> 01:38:21,464
He never actually said so,
but I think he made his peace with God.

1217
01:38:29,139 --> 01:38:31,348
For the second time in 17 days,

1218
01:38:31,475 --> 01:38:34,935
President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.

1219
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:36,312
Base to Jenny 1.

1220
01:38:36,396 --> 01:38:39,899
- Base to Jenny 1.
- Jenny 1. Go, Margo.

1221
01:38:39,983 --> 01:38:41,484
Forrest has a phone call.

1222
01:38:41,568 --> 01:38:44,069
Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them
to call him back.

1223
01:38:44,154 --> 01:38:47,531
- He is indisposed at the moment.
- His mama's sick.

1224
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:10,596
- Where's Mama?
- She's upstairs.

1225
01:39:13,433 --> 01:39:15,392
Hi, Forrest.

1226
01:39:16,353 --> 01:39:18,896
I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

1227
01:39:25,570 --> 01:39:28,739
We sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?

1228
01:39:40,085 --> 01:39:44,046
- What's the matter, Mama?
- I'm dying, Forrest.

1229
01:39:47,384 --> 01:39:49,760
Come on in, sit down over here.

1230
01:40:04,109 --> 01:40:07,611
- Why are you dying, Mama?
- It's my time.

1231
01:40:08,613 --> 01:40:10,489
It's just my time.

1232
01:40:11,950 --> 01:40:16,120
Now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.

1233
01:40:17,747 --> 01:40:20,124
Death is just a part of life,

1234
01:40:21,126 --> 01:40:23,752
something we're all destined to do.

1235
01:40:25,589 --> 01:40:29,967
I didn't know it,
but I was destined to be your mama.

1236
01:40:30,802 --> 01:40:34,387
- I did the best I could.
- You did good, Mama.

1237
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:40,351
Well, I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.

1238
01:40:41,854 --> 01:40:45,106
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.

1239
01:40:48,986 --> 01:40:51,112
What's my destiny, Mama?

1240
01:40:53,282 --> 01:40:56,492
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.

1241
01:40:57,786 --> 01:41:00,747
Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest.

1242
01:41:00,831 --> 01:41:02,999
You never know
what you're going to get.

1243
01:41:03,125 --> 01:41:07,503
Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.

1244
01:41:07,588 --> 01:41:09,797
I will miss you, Forrest.

1245
01:41:11,634 --> 01:41:15,678
She had got the cancer
and died on a Tuesday.

1246
01:41:17,181 --> 01:41:20,516
I bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it.

1247
01:41:23,562 --> 01:41:26,856
And that's all I have to say about that.

1248
01:41:33,697 --> 01:41:35,990
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number seven bus?

1249
01:41:36,075 --> 01:41:38,868
There'll be another one along shortly.

1250
01:41:42,706 --> 01:41:46,292
Now, because I had been a football star,
and a war hero,

1251
01:41:46,377 --> 01:41:49,504
and a national celebrity,
and a shrimping boat captain,

1252
01:41:50,005 --> 01:41:53,216
and a college graduate,
the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama

1253
01:41:53,342 --> 01:41:56,552
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.

1254
01:41:57,930 --> 01:42:01,599
So, I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,

1255
01:42:01,725 --> 01:42:04,435
though he did take care
of my Bubba-Gump money.

1256
01:42:04,561 --> 01:42:09,148
He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.

1257
01:42:09,233 --> 01:42:10,817
And so then, I got a call from him saying

1258
01:42:10,901 --> 01:42:14,362
we don't have to worry about money
no more, and I said,

1259
01:42:14,446 --> 01:42:16,739
"That's good. One less thing. "

1260
01:42:19,785 --> 01:42:23,705
Now, Mama said there's only
so much fortune a man really needs,

1261
01:42:24,456 --> 01:42:27,291
and the rest is just for showing off.

1262
01:42:27,376 --> 01:42:31,254
So, I gave a whole bunch of it
to the Foursquare gospel church,

1263
01:42:33,716 --> 01:42:37,885
and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre fishing hospital.

1264
01:42:40,764 --> 01:42:45,309
And even though Bubba was dead
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,

1265
01:42:45,436 --> 01:42:48,062
I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.

1266
01:42:52,276 --> 01:42:53,985
You know what?

1267
01:42:55,237 --> 01:42:58,239
She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.

1268
01:42:58,323 --> 01:42:59,949
That smells wonderful.

1269
01:43:00,784 --> 01:43:04,703
And 'cause I was a gazillionaire
and I liked doing it so much,

1270
01:43:04,787 --> 01:43:07,122
I cut that grass for free.

1271
01:43:10,918 --> 01:43:13,795
But at night time
when there was nothing to do

1272
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:16,256
and the house was all empty,

1273
01:43:17,258 --> 01:43:19,634
I'd always think of Jenny.

1274
01:44:23,324 --> 01:44:26,493
And then, she was there.

1275
01:44:59,485 --> 01:45:02,654
- Hello, Forrest.
- Hello, Jenny.

1276
01:45:14,208 --> 01:45:16,835
Jenny came back and stayed with me.

1277
01:45:18,421 --> 01:45:22,090
Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,

1278
01:45:22,216 --> 01:45:25,927
or maybe it was because she was
so tired, 'cause she went to bed

1279
01:45:26,053 --> 01:45:30,015
and slept and slept,
like she hadn't slept in years.

1280
01:45:31,266 --> 01:45:33,559
It was wonderful having her home.

1281
01:45:34,895 --> 01:45:40,024
Every day we'd take a walk and
I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree,

1282
01:45:40,108 --> 01:45:42,651
and she'd listen about Ping-Ponging,
and shrimping,

1283
01:45:42,736 --> 01:45:47,031
and Mama making a trip up to heaven.
I did all the talking.

1284
01:45:47,115 --> 01:45:50,451
Jenny most of the time was real quiet.

1285
01:46:30,617 --> 01:46:33,827
How could you do this?

1286
01:47:10,782 --> 01:47:14,118
Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.

1287
01:47:16,329 --> 01:47:20,833
I never really knew why she came back,
but I didn't care.

1288
01:47:21,001 --> 01:47:25,296
It was like olden times.
We was like peas and carrots again.

1289
01:47:27,382 --> 01:47:31,719
Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her,

1290
01:47:33,221 --> 01:47:36,807
and she gave me the best gift anyone
could ever get in the wide world.

1291
01:47:36,891 --> 01:47:39,727
- New shoes.
- They make them just for running.

1292
01:47:44,733 --> 01:47:48,027
And she even showed me how to dance.

1293
01:47:56,202 --> 01:48:00,413
And, well, we was like family,
Jenny and me.

1294
01:48:04,168 --> 01:48:07,086
And it was the happiest time in my life.

1295
01:48:26,732 --> 01:48:28,524
And this Fourth is
witnessing one of the

1296
01:48:28,609 --> 01:48:31,611
largest fireworks displays
in the nation's...

1297
01:48:31,695 --> 01:48:34,614
- You done watching it?
... here in New York Harbor...

1298
01:48:34,740 --> 01:48:36,532
- I'm going to bed.
... with a spectacular display

1299
01:48:36,617 --> 01:48:39,660
of tall ships earlier.
The Statue of Liberty...

1300
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:48,711
Will you marry me?

1301
01:48:53,634 --> 01:48:56,594
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.

1302
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:01,307
You would, Forrest.

1303
01:49:03,143 --> 01:49:05,478
But you won't marry me.

1304
01:49:07,773 --> 01:49:09,982
You don't want to marry me.

1305
01:49:13,570 --> 01:49:15,988
Why don't you love me, Jenny?

1306
01:49:20,994 --> 01:49:23,121
I'm not a smart man,

1307
01:49:24,832 --> 01:49:27,250
but I know what love is.

1308
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,538
Jenny.

1309
01:50:07,458 --> 01:50:09,959
Forrest, I do love you.

1310
01:51:03,095 --> 01:51:06,765
- Where are you running off to?
- I'm not running.

1311
01:52:38,357 --> 01:52:43,695
That day, for no particular reason,
I decided to go for a little run.

1312
01:52:44,864 --> 01:52:49,284
So, I ran to the end of the road,
and when I got there,

1313
01:52:49,368 --> 01:52:51,119
I thought maybe I'd run
to the end of town.

1314
01:52:51,203 --> 01:52:52,370
President Carter, suffering

1315
01:52:52,455 --> 01:52:54,456
from heat exhaustion,
fell into the arms of...

1316
01:52:54,540 --> 01:52:56,206
And when I got there,

1317
01:52:56,291 --> 01:53:00,461
I thought maybe I'd just
run across Greenbow County.

1318
01:53:00,545 --> 01:53:02,963
And I figured since I'd run this far,

1319
01:53:03,048 --> 01:53:06,300
maybe I'd just run across
the great state of Alabama.

1320
01:53:06,384 --> 01:53:07,593
And that's what I did.

1321
01:53:08,219 --> 01:53:10,804
I ran clear across Alabama.

1322
01:53:11,056 --> 01:53:14,224
For no particular reason,
I just kept on going.

1323
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:17,144
I ran clear to the ocean.

1324
01:53:23,026 --> 01:53:26,195
And when I got there,
I figured since I'd gone this far,

1325
01:53:26,738 --> 01:53:29,573
might as well turn around
and just keep on going.

1326
01:53:33,328 --> 01:53:37,915
And when I got to another ocean,
I figured since I'd gone this far,

1327
01:53:39,709 --> 01:53:43,420
I might as well just turn back
and keep right on going.

1328
01:53:44,589 --> 01:53:49,426
When I got tired, I slept.
When I got hungry, I ate.

1329
01:53:49,511 --> 01:53:52,554
When I had to go, you know...

1330
01:53:54,182 --> 01:53:55,349
I went.

1331
01:53:55,433 --> 01:53:58,435
And so, you just ran.

1332
01:54:00,188 --> 01:54:01,271
Yeah.

1333
01:54:36,558 --> 01:54:41,812
I'd think a lot about Mama
and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.

1334
01:54:42,814 --> 01:54:46,316
But most of all, I thought about Jenny.

1335
01:54:47,402 --> 01:54:49,570
I thought about her a lot.

1336
01:54:50,321 --> 01:54:53,407
For more than two years now,
a man named Forrest Gump,

1337
01:54:53,491 --> 01:54:56,910
a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,

1338
01:54:56,995 --> 01:54:59,163
has been running across America.

1339
01:54:59,247 --> 01:55:01,248
Charles Cooper brings us this report.

1340
01:55:02,167 --> 01:55:04,585
For the fourth time
on his journey across America,

1341
01:55:04,669 --> 01:55:07,504
Forrest Gump,
the gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,

1342
01:55:07,630 --> 01:55:10,507
is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.

1343
01:55:11,134 --> 01:55:13,177
- I'll be damned. Forrest?
- Sir, why are you running?

1344
01:55:13,261 --> 01:55:14,344
Why are you running?

1345
01:55:14,429 --> 01:55:16,013
Are you doing this for world peace?

1346
01:55:16,097 --> 01:55:17,431
Are you doing this for the homeless?

1347
01:55:17,515 --> 01:55:20,517
- Are you running for women's rights?
- Or for the environment?

1348
01:55:20,602 --> 01:55:21,602
Or for animals?

1349
01:55:21,686 --> 01:55:24,604
They just couldn't believe
that somebody would do all that running

1350
01:55:24,688 --> 01:55:26,063
for no particular reason.

1351
01:55:26,148 --> 01:55:28,107
Why are you doing this?

1352
01:55:28,192 --> 01:55:33,196
I just felt like running.

1353
01:55:33,322 --> 01:55:36,532
It's you. I can't believe it's really you.

1354
01:55:37,367 --> 01:55:42,497
Now, for some reason, what I was doing
seemed to make sense to people.

1355
01:55:42,664 --> 01:55:44,791
I mean, it was like an alarm
went off in my head, you know?

1356
01:55:44,875 --> 01:55:46,709
I said,
"Here's a guy that's got his act together.

1357
01:55:46,835 --> 01:55:48,795
"Here's somebody
who's got it all figured out.

1358
01:55:48,879 --> 01:55:52,965
"Here's somebody who has the answer. "
I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump.

1359
01:55:53,050 --> 01:55:54,884
So, I got company.

1360
01:55:56,720 --> 01:56:02,558
And after that, I got more company.
And then, even more people joined in.

1361
01:56:05,020 --> 01:56:08,231
Somebody later told me
it gave people hope.

1362
01:56:10,025 --> 01:56:13,402
Now... Now, I don't know
anything about that,

1363
01:56:14,238 --> 01:56:16,823
but some of those people
asked me if I could help them out.

1364
01:56:17,032 --> 01:56:20,284
Hey, man, hey, listen, I was wondering
if you might help me, huh?

1365
01:56:20,369 --> 01:56:22,119
Listen, I'm in the
bumper sticker business

1366
01:56:22,204 --> 01:56:23,955
and I've been trying
to think up a good slogan.

1367
01:56:24,039 --> 01:56:27,166
And since you have been such a big
inspiration to the people around here,

1368
01:56:27,251 --> 01:56:29,168
I thought you might
be able to help me jump into...

1369
01:56:29,253 --> 01:56:32,880
Whoa, man! You just ran through
a big pile of dog shit!

1370
01:56:34,424 --> 01:56:37,093
- It happens.
- What, shit?

1371
01:56:38,595 --> 01:56:40,555
Sometimes.

1372
01:56:42,432 --> 01:56:45,101
And some years later,
I heard that that fellow

1373
01:56:45,185 --> 01:56:47,019
did come up with
a bumper sticker slogan,

1374
01:56:47,104 --> 01:56:50,106
and he made a lot of money off of it.

1375
01:56:51,567 --> 01:56:53,776
Another time, I was running along,

1376
01:56:53,902 --> 01:56:57,196
somebody who had lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,

1377
01:56:57,281 --> 01:56:59,323
he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt,

1378
01:56:59,408 --> 01:57:02,368
but he couldn't draw that well,
and he didn't have a camera.

1379
01:57:02,452 --> 01:57:05,955
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway.

1380
01:57:10,794 --> 01:57:12,461
Have a nice day.

1381
01:57:14,089 --> 01:57:15,214
Well, some years later,

1382
01:57:15,299 --> 01:57:19,218
I found out that that man
did come up with an idea for a T-shirt.

1383
01:57:19,303 --> 01:57:21,679
He made a lot of money off of it.

1384
01:57:24,474 --> 01:57:28,895
Anyway, like I was saying,
I had a lot of company.

1385
01:57:30,147 --> 01:57:31,314
My mama always said,

1386
01:57:31,398 --> 01:57:35,818
"You got to put the past behind you
before you can move on. "

1387
01:57:37,487 --> 01:57:40,823
And I think that's what
my running was all about.

1388
01:57:41,658 --> 01:57:45,661
I had run for three years, two months,

1389
01:57:45,913 --> 01:57:48,247
14 days and 16 hours.

1390
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:06,264
Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.

1391
01:58:17,693 --> 01:58:19,444
I'm pretty tired.

1392
01:58:22,281 --> 01:58:24,324
Think I'll go home now.

1393
01:58:42,885 --> 01:58:45,345
Now what are we supposed to do?

1394
01:58:46,305 --> 01:58:50,558
And just like that,
my running days was over.

1395
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:54,270
So, I went home to Alabama.

1396
01:58:55,064 --> 01:58:58,942
Moments ago, at 2:25 p. m.,
as President Reagan was leaving the...

1397
01:59:00,987 --> 01:59:05,156
...five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown would-be assassin.

1398
01:59:05,658 --> 01:59:07,993
The President was shot in the chest,
and the assailant...

1399
01:59:08,077 --> 01:59:10,036
I picked up the mail.

1400
01:59:10,830 --> 01:59:14,666
And one day, out of the blue clear sky,
I got a letter from Jenny,

1401
01:59:14,750 --> 01:59:19,004
wondering if I could come down
to Savannah and see her,

1402
01:59:19,088 --> 01:59:21,673
and that's what I'm doing here.

1403
01:59:21,757 --> 01:59:24,342
She saw me on TV, running.

1404
01:59:24,427 --> 01:59:28,680
I'm supposed to go on the
number nine bus to Richmond Street

1405
01:59:28,764 --> 01:59:35,687
and get off and go one block left
to 1947 Henry Street, Apartment 4.

1406
01:59:35,771 --> 01:59:39,441
Why, you don't need to take a bus.

1407
01:59:39,567 --> 01:59:44,112
Henry Street is just five
or six blocks down that way.

1408
01:59:45,948 --> 01:59:48,283
- Down that way?
- Down that way.

1409
01:59:51,287 --> 01:59:53,204
It was nice talking to you.

1410
01:59:54,498 --> 01:59:57,125
I hope everything works out for you!

1411
02:00:04,633 --> 02:00:06,301
Hey!

1412
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:08,386
Forrest!

1413
02:00:08,637 --> 02:00:11,890
How you doing? Come in, come in!

1414
02:00:11,974 --> 02:00:13,183
I got your letter.

1415
02:00:13,267 --> 02:00:15,894
I was wondering about that.

1416
02:00:17,438 --> 02:00:19,230
Is this your house?

1417
02:00:19,315 --> 02:00:22,399
Yeah. It's messy right now.
I just got off work.

1418
02:00:22,484 --> 02:00:26,195
It's nice. You got air conditioning.

1419
02:00:33,078 --> 02:00:35,120
- Thank you.
- I ate some.

1420
02:00:37,916 --> 02:00:43,337
Hey, I kept a scrapbook
of your clippings and everything.

1421
02:00:43,463 --> 02:00:45,089
There you are.

1422
02:00:46,674 --> 02:00:48,050
And this, I got you running.

1423
02:00:51,012 --> 02:00:53,180
I ran a long way,

1424
02:00:53,681 --> 02:00:55,516
for a long time.

1425
02:00:57,727 --> 02:00:59,228
And there...

1426
02:01:05,735 --> 02:01:09,196
Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.

1427
02:01:11,699 --> 02:01:16,036
I just I want to apologize
for anything that I ever did to you,

1428
02:01:16,162 --> 02:01:21,416
'cause I was messed up
for a long time, and...

1429
02:01:23,086 --> 02:01:24,086
Yoo-hoo!

1430
02:01:24,212 --> 02:01:25,838
- Hey.
- Hi.

1431
02:01:26,047 --> 02:01:27,047
Hey, you.

1432
02:01:28,216 --> 02:01:31,176
- This is an old friend from Alabama.
- How do you do?

1433
02:01:31,261 --> 02:01:34,346
Listen, next week my schedule
changes, so I'll be able to... But thanks...

1434
02:01:34,430 --> 02:01:36,473
No problem. Got to go, Jen,
I'm double-parked.

1435
02:01:36,558 --> 02:01:38,433
- Okay. Thanks.
- Bye.

1436
02:01:41,896 --> 02:01:44,648
This is my very good friend, Mr. Gump.
Can you say hi to him?

1437
02:01:44,732 --> 02:01:47,818
- Hello, Mr. Gump.
- Hello.

1438
02:01:47,902 --> 02:01:50,904
- Can I go watch TV now?
- Yes, you can. Just keep it low.

1439
02:01:53,741 --> 02:01:57,077
- You're a mama, Jenny.
- I'm a mama.

1440
02:01:59,956 --> 02:02:01,790
His name's Forrest.

1441
02:02:02,917 --> 02:02:04,251
Like me.

1442
02:02:05,879 --> 02:02:08,005
I named him after his daddy.

1443
02:02:08,965 --> 02:02:11,425
He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

1444
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:14,761
You're his daddy, Forrest.

1445
02:02:29,235 --> 02:02:30,444
Hey.

1446
02:02:31,613 --> 02:02:34,489
Forrest, look at me. Look at me, Forrest.

1447
02:02:37,076 --> 02:02:41,205
There's nothing you need to do, okay?
You didn't do anything wrong.

1448
02:02:41,748 --> 02:02:43,123
Okay?

1449
02:02:47,462 --> 02:02:49,337
Isn't he beautiful?

1450
02:02:50,339 --> 02:02:53,299
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1451
02:02:57,095 --> 02:02:58,179
But...

1452
02:03:01,850 --> 02:03:04,727
Is he smart, or...

1453
02:03:04,811 --> 02:03:08,814
He's very smart.
He's one of the smartest in his class.

1454
02:03:18,158 --> 02:03:20,618
Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

1455
02:03:29,962 --> 02:03:32,797
- What are you watching?
- Bert and Ernie.

1456
02:03:55,904 --> 02:03:57,697
Forrest,

1457
02:03:59,157 --> 02:04:00,700
I'm sick.

1458
02:04:03,370 --> 02:04:06,998
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?

1459
02:04:07,082 --> 02:04:09,458
I have some kind of virus,

1460
02:04:09,543 --> 02:04:12,253
and the doctors don't...
They don't know what it is,

1461
02:04:12,379 --> 02:04:15,381
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.

1462
02:04:19,761 --> 02:04:22,054
You could come home with me.

1463
02:04:23,724 --> 02:04:29,395
Jenny, you and little Forrest could
come stay at my house in Greenbow.

1464
02:04:33,734 --> 02:04:36,527
I'll take care of you if you're sick.

1465
02:04:38,905 --> 02:04:41,198
Would you marry me, Forrest?

1466
02:04:46,455 --> 02:04:47,705
Okay.

1467
02:04:48,749 --> 02:04:50,416
Please take your seats.

1468
02:04:54,254 --> 02:04:56,589
Forrest? It's time to start.

1469
02:05:15,984 --> 02:05:17,567
Hi.

1470
02:05:18,444 --> 02:05:19,944
Your tie.

1471
02:05:32,500 --> 02:05:51,434
Lieutenant Dan.

1472
02:05:52,269 --> 02:05:53,937
Hello, Forrest.

1473
02:05:54,605 --> 02:05:57,273
You got new legs. New legs!

1474
02:05:58,484 --> 02:06:02,278
Yeah. I got new legs. Custom-made.

1475
02:06:02,988 --> 02:06:06,991
Titanium alloy.
It's what they use on the space shuttle.

1476
02:06:10,830 --> 02:06:12,330
Magic legs.

1477
02:06:14,333 --> 02:06:18,711
This is my fiancée, Susan.

1478
02:06:21,507 --> 02:06:24,884
- Lieutenant Dan.
- Hi, Forrest.

1479
02:06:26,971 --> 02:06:30,181
Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

1480
02:06:30,558 --> 02:06:33,560
Hey. It's nice to meet you finally.

1481
02:06:43,696 --> 02:06:47,866
Do you, Forrest,
take Jenny to be your wife?

1482
02:06:49,743 --> 02:06:53,997
Do you, Jenny,
take Forrest to be your husband?

1483
02:06:55,332 --> 02:06:58,710
And so I pronounce you man and wife.

1484
02:07:29,575 --> 02:07:31,451
- Hey.
- Hey.

1485
02:07:45,132 --> 02:07:46,924
Hey, Forrest.

1486
02:07:52,263 --> 02:07:54,056
Were you scared in Vietnam?

1487
02:07:55,725 --> 02:07:58,060
Yes. Well, I...

1488
02:07:59,395 --> 02:08:01,104
I don't know.

1489
02:08:01,814 --> 02:08:06,777
Sometimes it would stop raining long
enough for the stars to come out.

1490
02:08:09,906 --> 02:08:11,949
And then it was nice.

1491
02:08:15,328 --> 02:08:19,289
It was like just before the sun
goes to bed down on the bayou.

1492
02:08:20,583 --> 02:08:24,461
There was always
a million sparkles on the water.

1493
02:08:26,256 --> 02:08:30,175
Like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,

1494
02:08:30,301 --> 02:08:34,888
it looked like there were two skies,
one on top of the other.

1495
02:08:37,433 --> 02:08:40,477
And then, in the desert,
when the sun comes up,

1496
02:08:42,939 --> 02:08:47,109
I couldn't tell where heaven stopped

1497
02:08:47,652 --> 02:08:50,028
and the earth began.

1498
02:08:51,281 --> 02:08:53,156
It was so beautiful.

1499
02:08:57,870 --> 02:09:00,956
I wish I could've been there with you.

1500
02:09:04,043 --> 02:09:05,460
You were.

1501
02:09:16,180 --> 02:09:17,639
I love you.

1502
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:25,355
You died on a Saturday morning.

1503
02:09:27,066 --> 02:09:30,819
And I had you placed
here under our tree.

1504
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:40,537
And I had that house of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.

1505
02:09:44,667 --> 02:09:46,335
Mama

1506
02:09:47,420 --> 02:09:52,424
always said that dying was a part of life.

1507
02:09:55,845 --> 02:09:58,180
I sure wish it wasn't.

1508
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:04,603
Little Forrest is doing just fine.

1509
02:10:05,938 --> 02:10:07,022
But...

1510
02:10:07,273 --> 02:10:09,941
About to start school again soon,

1511
02:10:11,778 --> 02:10:15,571
and I make his breakfast, lunch
and dinner every day.

1512
02:10:17,741 --> 02:10:23,746
I make sure he combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.

1513
02:10:26,875 --> 02:10:29,460
Teaching him how to play Ping-Pong.

1514
02:10:30,754 --> 02:10:31,796
Okay.

1515
02:10:32,047 --> 02:10:33,214
He's really good.

1516
02:10:33,298 --> 02:10:35,424
Forrest, you go.

1517
02:10:39,638 --> 02:10:41,222
We fish a lot.

1518
02:10:44,768 --> 02:10:48,229
And every night, we read
a book. He's so smart, Jenny.

1519
02:10:51,483 --> 02:10:53,734
You'd be so proud of him.

1520
02:10:55,445 --> 02:10:56,904
I am.

1521
02:10:57,948 --> 02:11:01,158
He wrote you a letter.

1522
02:11:02,744 --> 02:11:04,787
And he says I can't read it.

1523
02:11:04,913 --> 02:11:08,457
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it here for you.

1524
02:11:24,516 --> 02:11:25,850
Jenny,

1525
02:11:31,648 --> 02:11:34,859
I don't know if Mama was right,

1526
02:11:36,194 --> 02:11:37,695
or if it's Lieutenant Dan.

1527
02:11:37,821 --> 02:11:40,406
I don't know

1528
02:11:40,490 --> 02:11:44,994
if we each have a destiny,

1529
02:11:47,038 --> 02:11:52,168
or if we're all just floating around
accidental-like on a breeze.

1530
02:11:56,673 --> 02:11:58,507
But I think

1531
02:12:00,385 --> 02:12:02,178
maybe it's both.

1532
02:12:06,516 --> 02:12:09,393
Maybe both is happening
at the same time.

1533
02:12:15,525 --> 02:12:17,526
But I miss you, Jenny.

1534
02:12:23,909 --> 02:12:28,329
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

1535
02:13:03,614 --> 02:13:06,574
Here's your bus. Okay.

1536
02:13:08,244 --> 02:13:11,579
Hey. I know this.

1537
02:13:11,705 --> 02:13:14,582
I'm gonna show that
for show-and-tell because

1538
02:13:14,708 --> 02:13:17,377
Grandma used to read it to you.

1539
02:13:17,461 --> 02:13:19,587
My favorite book.

1540
02:13:22,925 --> 02:13:24,425
Here we are.

1541
02:13:24,593 --> 02:13:26,052
Okay.

1542
02:13:27,763 --> 02:13:29,264
Here you go.

1543
02:13:34,144 --> 02:13:36,646
Hey, Forrest, don't...

1544
02:13:40,109 --> 02:13:43,820
- I wanted to tell you, I love you.
- I love you, too, Daddy.

1545
02:13:45,823 --> 02:13:48,616
I'll be right here when you get back.

1546
02:13:53,163 --> 02:13:56,416
You understand this is
the bus to school, now, don't you?

1547
02:13:56,500 --> 02:14:00,044
Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris,
and I'm Forrest Gump.
