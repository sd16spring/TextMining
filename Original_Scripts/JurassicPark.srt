1
00:01:24,923 --> 00:01:27,758
Everybody, heads up. Keep it clear, now.

2
00:01:27,843 --> 00:01:29,218
Keep it clear.

3
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,095
Stand back.

4
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,437
Slow it down.

5
00:01:55,954 --> 00:01:58,326
- Pushing team, move in there.
- Move in.

6
00:01:59,374 --> 00:02:02,291
- On your ready.
- I want tasers on full charge.

7
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:07,170
Steady! Go on. Step back in.

8
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,132
Ready. Move it.

9
00:02:10,468 --> 00:02:11,797
And push!

10
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:21,263
Well, locked. Loading team, step away.

11
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:32,110
Jophery, raise the gate.

12
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:52,497
Block the opening! Don't let her get out!

13
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:03,388
Somebody help him!

14
00:03:03,646 --> 00:03:05,473
Work her back!

15
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:18,030
Shoot her!

16
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,573
Shoot her!

17
00:03:56,865 --> 00:04:00,199
- I heard that Hammond's not even here.
- He sends his apologies.

18
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:03,370
There's a $20 million lawsuit
for that worker's death...

19
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:06,028
...and you're telling me
that Hammond can't see me?

20
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:09,244
He had to leave early,
his daughter's getting a divorce.

21
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:12,372
I understand, but we need to deal
with the situation now.

22
00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:14,622
- The insurance company...
- You okay?

23
00:04:17,177 --> 00:04:21,673
The underwriters feel that the accident's
raised safety questions about the park.

24
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:24,347
That makes the investors very anxious.

25
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:28,017
I had to promise to conduct
a thorough, on-site inspection.

26
00:04:29,606 --> 00:04:32,275
Hammond hates inspections.
They slow everything down.

27
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:35,443
They'll pull the funding.
That'll slow him down even more.

28
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:42,946
Watch your head.

29
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:48,495
If two experts sign off on the island,
the insurance guys'll back off.

30
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,911
I've already got Ian Malcolm,
but they think he's too trendy.

31
00:04:52,003 --> 00:04:53,581
- They want Alan Grant.
- Grant?

32
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:55,830
You'll never get him out of Montana.

33
00:04:56,424 --> 00:04:57,420
Why not?

34
00:04:59,803 --> 00:05:00,882
Why not?

35
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:05,424
Because Grant's like me.

36
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,721
He's a digger.

37
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,310
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler,
we're ready to try again.

38
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,187
I hate computers.

39
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,148
The feeling's mutual.

40
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:17,326
Take a look.

41
00:06:20,257 --> 00:06:21,455
Did it work?

42
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,635
- How long does this take?
- Should bring an immediate return.

43
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,800
You shoot the radar into the ground,
and the bone bounces the image back.

44
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:30,969
Bounces it back...

45
00:06:33,062 --> 00:06:35,101
This new program is incredible.

46
00:06:35,648 --> 00:06:39,147
A few more years' development,
and we won't even have to dig anymore.

47
00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:40,942
Where's the fun in that?

48
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:45,028
It's a little distorted,
but I don't think it's the computer.

49
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:49,236
Post-mortem contraction
of the posterior neck ligaments.

50
00:06:49,787 --> 00:06:50,866
Velociraptor?

51
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:52,532
Yes. Good shape, too.

52
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:56,034
It's 5, 6 feet high. I'm guessing 9 feet long.

53
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:57,455
- Look...
- What'd you do?

54
00:06:57,544 --> 00:06:58,576
He touched it.

55
00:06:58,962 --> 00:07:02,912
- Dr. Grant's not machine compatible.
- Hell, they've got it in for me.

56
00:07:03,884 --> 00:07:06,505
And look at the half-moon shaped bones
in the wrist.

57
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:09,050
It's no wonder these guys learned
how to fly.

58
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:12,297
No, seriously.

59
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:18,938
Maybe dinosaurs have more in common
with present-day birds than with reptiles.

60
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:22,768
Look at the pubic bone, turned backward,
like a bird's.

61
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:26,728
Look at the vertebrae,
full of air sacs and hollows, like a bird's.

62
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:30,236
And even the word "raptor"
means "bird of prey."

63
00:07:30,577 --> 00:07:32,534
That doesn't look very scary.

64
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,949
More like a 6-foot turkey.

65
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:40,749
A turkey?

66
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:46,333
- Imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period.
- Here we go.

67
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:51,382
You'd get yourfirst look at this
6-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.

68
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:54,266
He moves like a bird,
lightly bobbing his head.

69
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:58,979
You keep still because maybe
his visual acuity is based on movement...

70
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:01,851
...like T. Rex and he'll lose you
if you don't move.

71
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:04,148
But no, not Velociraptor.

72
00:08:04,778 --> 00:08:08,478
You stare at him
and he just stares right back.

73
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:13,784
And that's when the attack comes.
Not from the front, but from the side.

74
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:18,162
From the other two Raptors
you didn't even know were there.

75
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:24,329
Because Velociraptor's a pack hunter.
He uses co-ordinated attack patterns...

76
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,915
...and he is out in force today.

77
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,215
And he slashes at you with this...

78
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:35,217
...a 6-inch retractable claw,
like a razor, on the middle toe.

79
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:39,347
He doesn't bother to bite your jugular
like a lion. No.

80
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,271
He slashes at you...

81
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:44,141
...here or here...

82
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:45,348
Alan.

83
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:50,019
Or maybe across the belly,
spilling your intestines.

84
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:56,110
The point is, you are alive
when they start to eat you.

85
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:00,873
So, you know, try to show a little respect.

86
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:02,956
Okay.

87
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:14,971
Alan, if you wanted to scare the kid,
you could've pulled a gun on him.

88
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,590
Yeah, I know. Kids.

89
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,802
You want to have one of those?

90
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:25,854
I don't want that kid,
but a breed of child could be intriguing.

91
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,608
I mean, what's so wrong with kids?

92
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:33,023
They're noisy, they're messy,
they're expensive.

93
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:34,527
Cheap, cheap.

94
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,981
They smell.

95
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,952
- They don't smell!
- Some smell.

96
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:40,325
- Give me a break!
- Babies smell.

97
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,961
- Cover the site!
- Cover up the dig!

98
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:52,337
- Tell them to shut down!
- Cut the machine!

99
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:55,293
Cover it all up. Pull it over.

100
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:00,722
Just cut it, will you? Shut it down!

101
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,424
What?

102
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,994
What the hell do you think
you're doing in here?

103
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,571
We were saving that.

104
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,580
For today, I guarantee it.

105
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,164
- Who in God's name do you think you are?
- John Hammond.

106
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,624
And I'm delighted to meet you finally
in person, Dr. Grant.

107
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:39,671
So, I can see that my $50,000 a year
has been well spent.

108
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,588
Who's the jerk?

109
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:45,099
- This is our paleobotanist. Dr...
- Sattler.

110
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,471
Ellie, this is Mr. Hammond.

111
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,940
I'm sorry about the dramatic entrance,
Dr. Sattler, but...

112
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,018
- Did I say "jerk"?
...we're in a hurry.

113
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,480
Will you have a drink?
We won't let it get warm. Sit down.

114
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,449
- Let me have this.
- I'll just get a glass or two. I can do it.

115
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:03,821
- There's samples all over here.
- I know my way around the kitchen.

116
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,823
Now, I'll get right to the point.

117
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,867
I like you. Both of you.

118
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:13,545
I can tell instantly about people. It's a gift.

119
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,802
I own an island off the coast of Costa Rica.

120
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,887
I've leased it from the government
and during the last five years...

121
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,466
...I've been setting up a biological preserve.

122
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,933
Really spectacular. Spared no expense.

123
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,473
Make the one I've got down in Kenya
look like a petting zoo.

124
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:36,730
And there's no doubt our attractions
will drive kids out of their minds.

125
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,191
- And what are those?
- Small versions of adults, honey.

126
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,240
And not just kids, everyone.

127
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:47,784
We're opening next year, if the lawyers
don't kill me first. Do you like lawyers?

128
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,626
- I don't really know any.
- Don't really know any.

129
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:56,789
I do, and there's a particular one right now,
who represents my investors.

130
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,884
Says that they insist on outside opinions.

131
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,593
What kind of opinions?

132
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,722
Well, your kind,
not to put too fine a point on it.

133
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,887
Let's face it, in your particularfields,
you're the top minds.

134
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,434
And if I could just persuade you...

135
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,064
...to sign off on the park,
give it your endorsement...

136
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:19,563
...maybe even pen a wee testimonial,
I could get back on schedule.

137
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,775
- Why would they care what we think?
- What kind of park is this?

138
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,037
It's right up your alley.

139
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,161
Why don't you come down,
just the pair of you, for the weekend?

140
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,421
I'd love to have an opinion
of a paleobotanist as well.

141
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,374
I've got a jet standing by at Choteau.

142
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,670
I'm sorry. This isn't possible.

143
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,175
We just dug up a new skeleton...

144
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:52,311
I'd compensate you
by fully funding your dig...

145
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,440
- This is a very unusual time.
- The timing is...

146
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,849
...for a further three years.

147
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,240
Where's the plane?

148
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:06,863
- Okay.
- Three years.

149
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:07,983
Cheers.

150
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:51,533
Dodgson!

151
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:01,713
You shouldn't use my name.

152
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,551
Dodgson. We've got Dodgson here.

153
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:09,383
See, nobody cares. Nice hat.

154
00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:12,850
What're you trying to look like,
a secret agent?

155
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,637
- Well?
- $750,000.

156
00:14:15,228 --> 00:14:17,684
On delivery, $50,000 more
for each viable embryo.

157
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:20,809
That's $1.5 million
if you get all 15 species off the island.

158
00:14:20,984 --> 00:14:22,015
I'll get them all.

159
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:26,024
Remember, viable embryos.
They're no use to us if they don't survive.

160
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:28,356
How am I supposed to transport them?

161
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,828
The bottom screws open.

162
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:37,157
That's great. Oh, my God.

163
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,788
It's cooled and compartmentalised inside.

164
00:14:40,003 --> 00:14:43,418
- You guys. That's great.
- Customs can even check it if they want to.

165
00:14:43,506 --> 00:14:44,881
- Let me see.
- Go on.

166
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:48,634
- There's enough coolant for 36 hours.
- No menthol?

167
00:14:48,886 --> 00:14:51,971
The embryos have to be back here
in San José by then.

168
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:53,800
That's up to your guy on the boat.

169
00:14:53,891 --> 00:14:57,556
7:00 tomorrow night on the east dock.
Make sure he gets it right.

170
00:14:57,687 --> 00:15:01,636
- How are you planning to beat security?
- I've got an 18-minute window.

171
00:15:01,816 --> 00:15:05,434
18 minutes and your company
catches up on 10 years of research.

172
00:15:09,824 --> 00:15:11,816
Don't get cheap on me, Dodgson.

173
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,197
That was Hammond's mistake.

174
00:15:30,469 --> 00:15:33,256
So you two dig up dinosaurs?

175
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:37,467
- Well...
- We try to.

176
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:46,271
You'll have to get used to Dr. Malcolm.

177
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:50,904
He suffers from a deplorable excess
of personality, for a mathematician.

178
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,947
Chaotician. Chaotician, actually.

179
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:54,825
John doesn't subscribe to chaos...

180
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,697
...particularly what it says
about his science project.

181
00:15:57,788 --> 00:16:01,121
Ian, you've never been able to
sufficiently explain your concerns...

182
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:04,079
Because of the behaviour
of the system in phase space?

183
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:07,455
A load, if I may say so,
of fashionable number crunching...

184
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:08,752
Don't.

185
00:16:08,882 --> 00:16:11,967
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant,
you've heard of Chaos Theory?

186
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:13,174
No.

187
00:16:13,303 --> 00:16:15,095
No? Non-linear equations?

188
00:16:16,056 --> 00:16:17,550
Strange attractors?

189
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,186
I refuse to believe that you aren't familiar
with the concept of attraction.

190
00:16:28,276 --> 00:16:31,562
I bring scientists. You bring a rock star.

191
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:37,065
There it is.

192
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,725
Bad wind shears. We have to drop
pretty fast. Hold on, this will be thrilling.

193
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:40,223
But you need that piece over here,
and that piece...

194
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:43,058
We'll have landed
by the time you get it right.

195
00:17:44,352 --> 00:17:45,550
Great.

196
00:19:03,555 --> 00:19:06,225
The full 50 miles of perimeterfence
are in place?

197
00:19:06,308 --> 00:19:09,511
And the concrete moats,
and the motion-sensor tracking systems.

198
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:12,806
Donald, dear boy, relax.
Try and enjoy yourself.

199
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:15,982
Let's get this straight.
This is not a weekend excursion.

200
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:19,152
This is a serious investigation
of the stability of the island.

201
00:19:19,238 --> 00:19:22,357
Your investors, whom I represent,
are deeply concerned.

202
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:25,699
48 hours from now,
if they're not convinced, I'm not convinced.

203
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:27,529
I'll shut you down, John.

204
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:32,285
In 48 hours,
I'll be accepting your apologies.

205
00:19:41,635 --> 00:19:43,923
All right, slow down. Slow. Stop.

206
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:47,633
This shouldn't be here.

207
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:10,496
Alan, this species of veriforman
has been extinct, since...

208
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,332
...the Cretaceous Period.
I mean, this thing...

209
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,745
What?

210
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:45,650
Look at that.

211
00:20:49,035 --> 00:20:51,241
It's a dinosaur.

212
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:58,750
You did it. Crazy son of a bitch, you did it.

213
00:21:00,088 --> 00:21:03,670
We could tear up the rule book
on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply.

214
00:21:03,758 --> 00:21:06,130
They're wrong.
This is a warm-blooded creature.

215
00:21:06,219 --> 00:21:09,919
- This thing doesn't live in a swamp.
- This thing's got a 25, 27-foot neck?

216
00:21:10,014 --> 00:21:12,552
- The Brachiosaurus? 30.
- 30 feet.

217
00:21:29,158 --> 00:21:31,696
We're gonna make a fortune
with this place.

218
00:21:36,624 --> 00:21:38,082
How fast are they?

219
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:41,412
Well, we clocked the T. Rex
at 32 miles an hour.

220
00:21:43,297 --> 00:21:44,672
T. Rex?

221
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,709
You said you've got a T. Rex?

222
00:21:48,886 --> 00:21:50,001
Say again.

223
00:21:51,055 --> 00:21:52,383
We have a T. Rex.

224
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,508
Put your head between your knees.

225
00:21:56,936 --> 00:21:58,180
Dr. Grant...

226
00:21:58,646 --> 00:22:00,555
...my dear Dr. Sattler...

227
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:04,771
...welcome to Jurassic Park.

228
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,591
They're moving in herds.

229
00:22:31,845 --> 00:22:33,423
They do move in herds.

230
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,104
How did you do this?

231
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:47,229
I'll show you.

232
00:23:11,635 --> 00:23:13,342
G'day.

233
00:23:14,054 --> 00:23:17,636
The most advanced amusement park
in the entire world...

234
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:20,679
...incorporating all the latest technologies.

235
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:24,054
And I'm not talking just about rides.
Everybody has rides.

236
00:23:24,147 --> 00:23:28,358
No, we've made living
biological attractions so astounding...

237
00:23:28,526 --> 00:23:32,026
...that they'll capture the imagination
of the entire planet.

238
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:34,190
So, what are you thinking?

239
00:23:35,491 --> 00:23:38,409
- That we're out of a job.
- Don't you mean "extinct"?

240
00:23:46,502 --> 00:23:50,500
Why don't you all sit down?
Donald, sit down.

241
00:23:51,382 --> 00:23:54,467
Here he comes. Well, here I come.

242
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,136
<i>Hello.</i>

243
00:24:01,142 --> 00:24:02,305
Say hello.

244
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,509
Hello.

245
00:24:04,896 --> 00:24:06,058
<i>Hello, John.</i>

246
00:24:06,772 --> 00:24:08,564
Yes, I've got lines.

247
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:12,101
<i>Well, fine, I guess.
But, how did I get here?</i>

248
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:17,112
Well, let me show you.
First, I'll need a drop of blood.

249
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:18,940
Your blood.

250
00:24:19,035 --> 00:24:20,030
<i>Right.</i>

251
00:24:21,871 --> 00:24:23,069
<i>That hurt.</i>

252
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:26,623
Relax, John.
It's all part of the miracle of cloning.

253
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:28,743
<i>Hello, John.</i>

254
00:24:30,755 --> 00:24:34,835
Cloned from what? Loy extraction
hasn't recreated an intact DNA strand.

255
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:37,001
Not without massive sequence gaps.

256
00:24:37,094 --> 00:24:38,921
Paleo DNA, from what source?

257
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,096
Where do you get 100 million-year-old
dinosaur blood?

258
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:49,136
<i>What? What?</i>

259
00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:52,853
<i>Well, Mr. DNA, where did you come from?</i>

260
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:54,307
<i>From your blood.</i>

261
00:24:54,403 --> 00:24:58,697
<i>Just one drop of your blood
contains billions of strands of DNA...</i>

262
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:01,274
<i>...the building blocks of life.</i>

263
00:25:02,036 --> 00:25:06,697
<i>A DNA strand like me
is a blueprint for building a living thing.</i>

264
00:25:06,915 --> 00:25:12,158
<i>And sometimes animals that went extinct
millions of years ago, like dinosaurs...</i>

265
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:17,379
<i>...left their blueprints behind for us to find.
Wejust had to know where to look.</i>

266
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:22,379
<i>100 million years ago,
there were mosquitoesjust like today.</i>

267
00:25:22,514 --> 00:25:25,800
<i>And just like today,
they fed on the blood of animals.</i>

268
00:25:26,101 --> 00:25:30,644
<i>Even dinosaurs.
Sometimes, after biting a dinosaur...</i>

269
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:35,477
<i>...mosquitoes would land on the branch
of a tree and get stuck in the sap.</i>

270
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:40,730
<i>After a long time, the tree sap
would get hard and become fossilised...</i>

271
00:25:40,866 --> 00:25:45,741
<i>...just like a dinosaur bone,
preserving the mosquito inside.</i>

272
00:25:46,455 --> 00:25:50,037
<i>This fossilised tree sap,
which we call amber...</i>

273
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:54,627
<i>...waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside...</i>

274
00:25:54,796 --> 00:25:57,797
<i>...until Jurassic Park scientists came along.</i>

275
00:25:58,717 --> 00:26:02,928
<i>Using sophisticated techniques,
they extract the preserved blood...</i>

276
00:26:03,013 --> 00:26:07,342
<i>...from the mosquito,
and bingo: dino DNA!</i>

277
00:26:08,476 --> 00:26:12,770
<i>A full DNA strand contains
three billion genetic codes.</i>

278
00:26:13,356 --> 00:26:17,484
<i>If we looked at screens like these
once a second for eight hours a day...</i>

279
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:21,732
<i>...it'd take two years
to look at the entire DNA strand.</i>

280
00:26:21,823 --> 00:26:26,485
<i>It's that long.
Since it's so old, it's full of holes.</i>

281
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,789
<i>Now that's where our geneticists
take over.</i>

282
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:33,582
<i>Thinking machine super-computers
and gene sequencers...</i>

283
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:36,076
<i>...break down the strand in minutes.</i>

284
00:26:36,296 --> 00:26:38,335
<i>And virtual-reality displays...</i>

285
00:26:38,423 --> 00:26:41,589
<i>...show our geneticists the gaps
in the DNA sequence.</i>

286
00:26:42,176 --> 00:26:44,667
<i>We used the complete DNA of a frog...</i>

287
00:26:44,762 --> 00:26:48,677
<i>...to fill in the holes and complete the code.</i>

288
00:26:49,267 --> 00:26:53,430
<i>Whew! And now,
we can make a baby dinosaur.</i>

289
00:26:56,607 --> 00:27:00,308
This score is only temporary.
It all has very dramatic music, of course.

290
00:27:01,237 --> 00:27:03,810
A march or something.
It hasn't been written yet.

291
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:05,449
And then, the tour moves on.

292
00:27:15,293 --> 00:27:19,540
<i>Well, look here.
Those hard-working cowpokes...</i>

293
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:22,545
This is overwhelming, John.

294
00:27:22,717 --> 00:27:26,714
Are these characters autoerotica?

295
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:29,551
No, we have no animatronics here.

296
00:27:29,765 --> 00:27:32,885
Those people are the real miracle workers
of Jurassic Park.

297
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:36,389
<i>...in unfertilised emu or ostrich eggs.</i>

298
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:40,143
Wait a minute.
How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?

299
00:27:40,234 --> 00:27:42,939
- Can't we see the unfertilised eggs?
- Shortly.

300
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:47,985
<i>Now a whole team of genetic engineers
goes to work on...</i>

301
00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:51,444
- Can't you stop these things?
- I'm sorry. It's kind of a ride.

302
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:53,494
One, two, three.

303
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:56,536
You can't do that.

304
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:58,873
- What?
- Can they do that?

305
00:28:01,422 --> 00:28:05,751
<i>A reminder: the boat for the mainland
will be leaving at 19:00.</i>

306
00:28:05,843 --> 00:28:10,754
<i>All personnel be at the dock
no later than 18:45. No exceptions.</i>

307
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:14,760
- G'day, Henry.
- Good day, sir.

308
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,318
It's turning the eggs.

309
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:38,040
Perfect timing. I'd hoped they'd hatch
before I had to go to the boat.

310
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:40,580
Henry, why didn't you tell me?

311
00:28:40,794 --> 00:28:44,708
I insist on being here when they're born.

312
00:28:45,465 --> 00:28:47,837
Come on.

313
00:28:49,386 --> 00:28:52,340
Come on, little one.

314
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,934
Very good. Push.

315
00:29:05,902 --> 00:29:08,061
- Very good.
- God.

316
00:29:08,154 --> 00:29:10,562
Push. Come on.

317
00:29:11,157 --> 00:29:14,075
Come on. Come on, then.

318
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:17,204
There you are. There.

319
00:29:22,252 --> 00:29:26,296
They imprint on the first creature
they come in contact with.

320
00:29:26,923 --> 00:29:28,631
Helps them to trust me.

321
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:34,305
I've been present for the birth
of every creature on this island.

322
00:29:35,348 --> 00:29:38,551
Surely not the ones
that have bred in the wild.

323
00:29:38,726 --> 00:29:40,968
Actually they can't breed in the wild.

324
00:29:41,062 --> 00:29:43,897
Population control is one
of our security precautions.

325
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,936
There's no unauthorised breeding
in Jurassic Park.

326
00:29:48,194 --> 00:29:50,353
How do you know they can't breed?

327
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:54,941
Because all the animals
in Jurassic Park are female.

328
00:29:55,034 --> 00:29:57,406
We've engineered them that way.

329
00:29:57,578 --> 00:29:59,121
There you are.

330
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:04,167
Oh, my God. Look at that.

331
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:08,037
Blood temperature seems like
about high 80s, maybe.

332
00:30:08,131 --> 00:30:08,877
What?

333
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:10,459
- 91.
- 91.

334
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,791
Homeothermic? It holds that temperature?

335
00:30:12,885 --> 00:30:14,000
Yes.

336
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:21,351
But, again, how do you know
they're all female?

337
00:30:21,435 --> 00:30:25,516
What, does somebody go out in the park
and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?

338
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:29,106
We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.

339
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:31,601
All vertebrate embryos
are inherently female.

340
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:35,528
They just require an extra hormone
given at the right developmental stage...

341
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:36,731
...to make them male.

342
00:30:36,826 --> 00:30:39,743
- We simply deny them that.
- Deny them that?

343
00:30:39,829 --> 00:30:43,411
John, the kind of control
you're attempting is not possible.

344
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:46,500
If there's one thing the history
of evolution has taught us...

345
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:50,797
...it's that life will not be contained.
Life breaks free. Expands to new places...

346
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:54,673
...and it crashes through barriers,
painfully, maybe even dangerously...

347
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,465
...but there it is.

348
00:30:59,014 --> 00:31:00,473
There it is.

349
00:31:00,766 --> 00:31:05,973
You're implying that a group composed
entirely of female animals will breed.

350
00:31:06,063 --> 00:31:10,476
No, I'm simply saying that life finds a way.

351
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:19,532
What species is this?

352
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,245
It's a Velociraptor.

353
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:28,912
You bred Raptors?

354
00:31:42,057 --> 00:31:47,300
Dr. Grant! As I was saying, we laid on
lunch for you before you go into the park.

355
00:31:47,396 --> 00:31:50,432
- Our gourmet chef, Alejandro...
- What are they doing?

356
00:31:56,738 --> 00:31:57,936
Feeding them.

357
00:32:02,994 --> 00:32:08,237
Alejandro's prepared a delightful menu
for us. Chilean sea bass.

358
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:10,198
Shall we?

359
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,538
They should all be destroyed.

360
00:32:52,627 --> 00:32:53,742
Robert Muldoon.

361
00:32:53,836 --> 00:32:55,628
My game warden from Kenya.

362
00:32:55,713 --> 00:32:58,714
Bit of an alarmist, but knows more
about Raptors than anyone.

363
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,543
What's their growth rate?

364
00:33:00,635 --> 00:33:03,304
They're lethal at eight months,
and I do mean lethal.

365
00:33:03,388 --> 00:33:06,970
I've hunted most things that can hunt you,
but how these things move...

366
00:33:07,058 --> 00:33:09,050
- Fast for a biped?
- Cheetah speed.

367
00:33:09,143 --> 00:33:12,180
50, 60 miles per hour
if they ever got out in the open.

368
00:33:12,271 --> 00:33:14,063
And they're astonishing jumpers.

369
00:33:14,148 --> 00:33:17,398
Yes. That's why we're taking
extreme precautions.

370
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,227
Do they show intelligence?

371
00:33:21,322 --> 00:33:25,023
They show extreme intelligence.
Even problem-solving intelligence.

372
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,035
Especially the big one.

373
00:33:27,411 --> 00:33:29,700
We bred eight originally,
but when she came in...

374
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:33,122
...she took over the pride
and killed all but two of the others.

375
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:38,832
That one, when she looks at you,
you can see she's working things out.

376
00:33:40,257 --> 00:33:42,499
That's why we have to feed them like this.

377
00:33:42,593 --> 00:33:45,629
She had them all attacking the fences
when the feeders came.

378
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:47,465
The fences are electrified, right?

379
00:33:47,556 --> 00:33:50,641
That's right, but they never attack
the same place twice.

380
00:33:50,851 --> 00:33:54,516
They were testing the fences
for weaknesses systematically.

381
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,434
They remember.

382
00:34:08,702 --> 00:34:11,573
Yes. Well, who's hungry?

383
00:34:11,956 --> 00:34:15,574
<i>More adventurous guests, of course,
can opt for ourjungle river cruise...</i>

384
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:17,874
<i>...or for a close-up look at our majestic...</i>

385
00:34:17,961 --> 00:34:21,461
None of these attractions are ready yet,
but the park will open...

386
00:34:21,548 --> 00:34:25,878
...with the basic tour you are about to take,
and then other rides will come on-line...

387
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:29,588
...six or twelve months after that.
Absolutely spectacular designs.

388
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:32,967
- Spared no expense.
- And we can charge anything we want.

389
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,765
$2,000 a day, $10,000 a day,
and people will pay it.

390
00:34:35,854 --> 00:34:38,725
- And there's the merchandise...
- Donald.

391
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:42,483
This park was not built to cater
only for the super rich.

392
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:45,570
Everyone in the world has the right
to enjoy these animals.

393
00:34:45,656 --> 00:34:46,770
Sure. They will.

394
00:34:46,865 --> 00:34:50,316
We'll have a coupon day or something.

395
00:34:54,247 --> 00:35:00,001
The lack of humility before nature
that's being displayed here staggers me.

396
00:35:00,796 --> 00:35:04,295
I think things are a little different
than you and I had feared.

397
00:35:04,382 --> 00:35:05,960
I know. They're a lot worse.

398
00:35:06,051 --> 00:35:09,301
Now, wait a second,
we haven't even seen the park yet...

399
00:35:10,013 --> 00:35:14,307
Donald, let him talk. There's no reason,
I want to hear every viewpoint.

400
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:18,853
Don't you see the danger, John,
inherent in what you're doing here?

401
00:35:19,147 --> 00:35:22,314
Genetic power's the most awesome force
the planet's ever seen...

402
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,271
...but you wield it like a kid
that's found his dad's gun.

403
00:35:25,362 --> 00:35:28,861
- It's hardly appropriate to start hurling...
- If I may.

404
00:35:29,032 --> 00:35:32,697
I'll tell you the problem
with the scientific power you're using here.

405
00:35:32,786 --> 00:35:36,570
It didn't require any discipline to attain it.

406
00:35:36,956 --> 00:35:40,491
You read what others had done
and you took the next step.

407
00:35:40,627 --> 00:35:42,785
You didn't earn the knowledge
for yourselves...

408
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:45,631
...so you don't take
any responsibility for it.

409
00:35:46,299 --> 00:35:50,463
You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to
accomplish something as fast as you could.

410
00:35:50,553 --> 00:35:54,633
Before you even knew what you had,
you patented it, and packaged it...

411
00:35:54,724 --> 00:35:58,971
...and slapped it on a plastic lunch box,
and now you're selling it.

412
00:36:00,313 --> 00:36:02,602
I don't think you're giving us
our due credit.

413
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:06,106
Our scientists have done things
which nobody has ever done before.

414
00:36:06,194 --> 00:36:09,444
But your scientists were so preoccupied
with whether they could...

415
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,772
...they didn't stop to think if they should.

416
00:36:11,866 --> 00:36:15,615
Condors.
Condors are on the verge of extinction.

417
00:36:15,828 --> 00:36:21,368
If I created condors on this island,
you wouldn't have anything to say.

418
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:24,164
This isn't some species
that was obliterated...

419
00:36:24,253 --> 00:36:27,373
...by deforestation or the building of a dam.

420
00:36:27,715 --> 00:36:32,673
Dinosaurs had their shot
and nature selected them for extinction.

421
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:38,677
I don't understand this Luddite attitude.
Especially from a scientist.

422
00:36:38,768 --> 00:36:43,679
How can we stand in the light of discovery
and not act?

423
00:36:43,773 --> 00:36:47,438
What's so great about discovery?
It's a violent, penetrative act...

424
00:36:47,526 --> 00:36:51,109
...that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery...

425
00:36:52,198 --> 00:36:54,902
...I call the rape of the natural world.

426
00:36:55,785 --> 00:36:59,782
The question is, how can you know
anything about an extinct eco-system?

427
00:36:59,872 --> 00:37:02,873
How could you ever assume
that you can control it?

428
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:07,371
You have poisonous plants in this building.
You picked them because they look good.

429
00:37:07,463 --> 00:37:11,674
But these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they're in...

430
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:14,760
...and they'll defend themselves.
Violently, if necessary.

431
00:37:17,181 --> 00:37:22,423
Dr. Grant. If there's one person who
could appreciate what I am trying to do...

432
00:37:24,021 --> 00:37:28,766
The world has just changed so radically
and we're all running to catch up.

433
00:37:29,485 --> 00:37:34,028
I don't want to jump to any conclusions,
but dinosaurs and man...

434
00:37:34,156 --> 00:37:38,319
...two species separated
by 65 million years of evolution...

435
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,861
...have just been suddenly
thrown back into the mix together.

436
00:37:41,955 --> 00:37:46,333
How can we possibly have
the slightest idea what to expect?

437
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:49,667
I don't believe it.

438
00:37:49,755 --> 00:37:53,040
You're meant to come here
and defend me against these characters...

439
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:56,584
...and the only one I've got on my side
is the blood-sucking lawyer.

440
00:37:57,429 --> 00:37:58,592
Thank you.

441
00:38:05,645 --> 00:38:06,926
They're here.

442
00:38:07,731 --> 00:38:10,566
You four are gonna have a spot
of company out in the park.

443
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,438
Spend a little time
with our target audience.

444
00:38:13,528 --> 00:38:14,607
Grandpa!

445
00:38:14,946 --> 00:38:16,109
Kids!

446
00:38:19,075 --> 00:38:22,575
- Wait! Careful with me.
- We missed you.

447
00:38:23,204 --> 00:38:26,905
- We loved the presents. They were great.
- Did you enjoy the helicopter?

448
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,669
Yeah, it went down
and we all went right up.

449
00:38:32,964 --> 00:38:36,131
Now, kids, come away.
Not too close to the cars.

450
00:38:37,635 --> 00:38:40,672
Aren't they lovely?
Aren't they glorious, though.

451
00:38:40,764 --> 00:38:43,255
These will be your transports
for the afternoon.

452
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:46,054
- No drivers?
- No, drivers. They're electric.

453
00:38:46,144 --> 00:38:49,180
They run on this track
in the middle of the roadway here.

454
00:38:49,272 --> 00:38:52,189
Totally non-polluting. Top of the line.
Spared no expense.

455
00:38:52,484 --> 00:38:55,057
It's an interactive CD-ROM!

456
00:38:55,153 --> 00:38:58,154
You touch the screen
and it talks about whatever you want.

457
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:01,324
Lex, you're all right in there.
Dr. Sattler, come with me.

458
00:39:01,409 --> 00:39:03,318
Dr. Grant, come in the second car.

459
00:39:03,411 --> 00:39:05,984
I'm gonna ride with, Dr. Sattler.

460
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,210
I read your book.

461
00:39:20,762 --> 00:39:22,007
That's great.

462
00:39:22,972 --> 00:39:26,637
Do you really think dinosaurs turned
into birds and that's where they went?

463
00:39:28,102 --> 00:39:30,973
A few species may have evolved
along those lines.

464
00:39:35,985 --> 00:39:38,357
They sure don't look like birds to me.

465
00:39:39,697 --> 00:39:42,532
I heard that there was this meteor...

466
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,911
...hit the earth someplace down in Mexico
and made this big crater.

467
00:39:46,996 --> 00:39:48,324
Listen...

468
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,419
...Tim, which car were you planning on?

469
00:39:54,837 --> 00:39:56,628
Whichever one you are.

470
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,507
<i>I heard about this thing in Omni
about this meteor making all this heat.</i>

471
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:07,129
It made diamond dust
and that changed the weather.

472
00:40:07,224 --> 00:40:08,849
They died because of the weather.

473
00:40:08,934 --> 00:40:13,395
My teacher tells me about this book
by a guy named Bakker. He says...

474
00:40:15,357 --> 00:40:18,809
She said I should ride with you
'cause it'd be good for you.

475
00:40:19,236 --> 00:40:20,944
<i>The boat is now loading.</i>

476
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:25,738
<i>Everyone must be on the dock
for the 19:00 departure.</i>

477
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,073
National Weather Service
is tracking a tropical storm...

478
00:40:30,164 --> 00:40:32,452
...about 75 miles west of us.

479
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,041
Why didn't I build in Orlando?

480
00:40:35,127 --> 00:40:38,875
I'll keep an eye on it.
Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.

481
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,169
Start the tour program.

482
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,603
Hold onto your butts.

483
00:41:06,283 --> 00:41:08,856
<i>And why did they put the fibreglass thing?</i>

484
00:41:19,754 --> 00:41:21,913
<i>You want to join the future, right?</i>

485
00:41:22,173 --> 00:41:24,462
<i>God help us when the hands of engineers...</i>

486
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:27,421
<i>During your tour,
the appropriate information will be...</i>

487
00:41:27,512 --> 00:41:30,181
<i>...automatically selected
and displayed for you.</i>

488
00:41:30,265 --> 00:41:33,930
<i>Simply touch the area of the screen
displaying the appropriate icon.</i>

489
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:35,299
Are we gonna hit that?

490
00:41:35,395 --> 00:41:37,471
<i>Welcome to Jurassic Park.</i>

491
00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:44,017
What have they got in there, King Kong?

492
00:41:57,584 --> 00:42:00,253
The voice you're now hearing
is Richard Kiley.

493
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,915
We spared no expense.

494
00:42:02,005 --> 00:42:03,463
<i>If you look to the right...</i>

495
00:42:03,548 --> 00:42:08,886
<i>...you'll see a herd of the first dinosaurs
on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.</i>

496
00:42:09,304 --> 00:42:11,426
- Dilophosaurus!
- Shit!

497
00:42:11,723 --> 00:42:13,514
<i>One of the earliest carnivores...</i>

498
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,684
<i>...we now know Dilophosaurus
is actually poisonous...</i>

499
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:21,977
<i>...spitting its venom at its prey,
causing blindness and paralysis...</i>

500
00:42:22,108 --> 00:42:25,228
<i>...allowing the carnivore
to eat at its leisure.</i>

501
00:42:25,862 --> 00:42:29,562
<i>This makes Dilophosaurus a beautiful
but deadly addition...</i>

502
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,567
<i>...to Jurassic Park.</i>

503
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,202
Alan?

504
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,254
Damn.

505
00:42:52,263 --> 00:42:54,505
Vehicle headlights are on
and not responding.

506
00:42:54,598 --> 00:42:57,089
Those shouldn't be running off
of car batteries.

507
00:42:57,184 --> 00:42:59,758
Item 151 on today's glitch list.

508
00:43:00,062 --> 00:43:02,980
We have all the problems
of a major theme park and a zoo...

509
00:43:03,065 --> 00:43:06,066
...and the computers
aren't even on their feet yet.

510
00:43:07,987 --> 00:43:11,771
Our lives are in your hands
and you have butterfingers?

511
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:15,823
I am totally unappreciated in my time.

512
00:43:16,036 --> 00:43:19,868
You can run this park from this room
with minimal staff for up to three days.

513
00:43:19,957 --> 00:43:22,530
You think that kind of automation is easy?

514
00:43:23,043 --> 00:43:23,873
Or cheap?

515
00:43:23,961 --> 00:43:26,630
You know anyone
who can network eight machines...

516
00:43:26,714 --> 00:43:30,711
...and de-bug two million lines of code
on my salary? If so, I want to see them.

517
00:43:30,801 --> 00:43:35,214
Sorry about yourfinancial problems,
I really am. But they are your problems.

518
00:43:35,305 --> 00:43:37,761
You're absolutely right.
Everything's my problem.

519
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:43,354
I will not be drawn into another
financial debate with you. I really will not.

520
00:43:43,564 --> 00:43:45,640
There's been hardly any debate at all.

521
00:43:45,732 --> 00:43:48,817
I don't blame people for their mistakes.

522
00:43:49,403 --> 00:43:51,645
But I do ask that they pay for them.

523
00:43:51,863 --> 00:43:53,062
Thanks, Dad.

524
00:43:54,324 --> 00:43:55,320
The headlights.

525
00:43:55,409 --> 00:43:58,078
I'll de-bug the tour program
when they get back, okay?

526
00:43:58,161 --> 00:44:01,412
It'll eat a lot of compute cycles.
We'll lose part of the system.

527
00:44:01,498 --> 00:44:04,748
There's a small amount of memory,
you can't use it for everything.

528
00:44:04,835 --> 00:44:07,954
- Are you gonna compile for a half an hour...
- Quiet, all of you!

529
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:11,796
They're approaching
the Tyrannosaur paddock.

530
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:06,392
God creates dinosaurs.
God destroys dinosaurs.

531
00:45:06,813 --> 00:45:11,605
God creates man. Man destroys God.
Man creates dinosaurs.

532
00:45:12,735 --> 00:45:16,733
Dinosaurs eat man.

533
00:45:17,824 --> 00:45:19,900
Woman inherits the earth.

534
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,703
<i>We'll try to tempt the Rex now.
Keep watching the fence.</i>

535
00:45:40,846 --> 00:45:42,720
What's going to happen to the goat?

536
00:45:47,061 --> 00:45:48,769
He's going to eat the goat?

537
00:45:49,105 --> 00:45:50,480
Excellent.

538
00:45:51,565 --> 00:45:54,816
What's the matter, kid?
You never had lamb chops?

539
00:45:55,444 --> 00:45:57,686
I happen to be a vegetarian.

540
00:46:06,038 --> 00:46:08,909
T. Rex doesn't want to be fed.
He wants to hunt.

541
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:14,959
Can't just suppress 65 million years
of gut instinct.

542
00:46:37,111 --> 00:46:42,069
<i>Eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs
on your dinosaur tour, right?</i>

543
00:46:45,452 --> 00:46:47,777
<i>Hello. Yes?</i>

544
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:50,364
I really hate that man.

545
00:46:55,587 --> 00:47:00,379
The Tyrannosaur doesn't obey
any set patterns or park schedules.

546
00:47:00,509 --> 00:47:02,382
The essence of chaos.

547
00:47:03,845 --> 00:47:05,803
I'm still not clear on chaos.

548
00:47:07,474 --> 00:47:11,388
It simply deals with unpredictability
in complex systems.

549
00:47:12,938 --> 00:47:14,930
The shorthand is the Butterfly Effect.

550
00:47:15,023 --> 00:47:17,229
A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking...

551
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:20,152
...and in Central Park
you get rain instead of sunshine.

552
00:47:22,614 --> 00:47:24,607
- Was I going too fast?
- I missed it.

553
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:25,695
I did a fly-by.

554
00:47:25,784 --> 00:47:28,535
Give me that glass of water.
We'll conduct an experiment.

555
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:31,740
The car should be still. But that's okay.
It's just an example.

556
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,698
Put your hand flat like a hieroglyphic.

557
00:47:35,543 --> 00:47:37,335
A drop of waterfalls on your hand.

558
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,042
Which way will the drop roll off?
Which finger?

559
00:47:40,465 --> 00:47:41,924
Thumb, I'd say.

560
00:47:44,636 --> 00:47:46,344
Freeze your hand. Don't move.

561
00:47:46,638 --> 00:47:49,674
I'll do the same thing,
start with the same place again.

562
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,225
Which way, now?

563
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:54,263
Let's say back the same way.

564
00:47:56,648 --> 00:47:59,020
It changed. Why?

565
00:47:59,192 --> 00:48:01,481
Because tiny variations...

566
00:48:02,028 --> 00:48:04,436
...the orientation of the hairs
on your hands...

567
00:48:04,531 --> 00:48:05,859
Alan, look at this.

568
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:09,816
...the amount of blood distending
your vessels, imperfections in the skin...

569
00:48:09,911 --> 00:48:12,318
- "Imperfections in the skin"?
- Just microscopic.

570
00:48:12,413 --> 00:48:15,996
...never repeat and vastly effect
the outcome. That's...

571
00:48:16,084 --> 00:48:18,123
...what?
- Unpredictability.

572
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,000
There. Look at this. See? I'm right again.

573
00:48:24,133 --> 00:48:28,546
Nobody could predict that Dr. Grant
would jump out of a moving vehicle.

574
00:48:30,765 --> 00:48:33,137
And there's another example.

575
00:48:34,644 --> 00:48:39,104
See, here I am now by myself,
talking to myself. That's Chaos Theory.

576
00:48:40,483 --> 00:48:42,107
Stop the program.

577
00:48:45,404 --> 00:48:49,272
I told you how many times we needed
locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors.

578
00:48:49,367 --> 00:48:52,118
<i>Stopping park vehicles
and rebooting program.</i>

579
00:48:52,578 --> 00:48:54,867
<i>We're on. Will notify for resume.</i>

580
00:48:57,291 --> 00:48:59,367
I'll switch it over to TelePrompTer.

581
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,544
- What about the circuit integrities?
- Screen says faulty sensor.

582
00:49:05,424 --> 00:49:08,959
- I'll call security.
- We're at full go on that and it looks good.

583
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:12,339
Like I said, there's this other book
by a guy named Bakker...

584
00:49:12,431 --> 00:49:14,720
...and he says dinosaurs died
from diseases.

585
00:49:14,809 --> 00:49:18,142
- Where are we going?
- He didn't say they turned into birds.

586
00:49:18,229 --> 00:49:20,352
Anyone else think
we shouldn't be out here?

587
00:49:20,439 --> 00:49:23,226
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Like this.

588
00:49:23,317 --> 00:49:26,069
- Really?
- Yours was fully illustrated.

589
00:49:27,571 --> 00:49:28,900
You okay?

590
00:49:29,031 --> 00:49:31,403
Look at this. Wait. Watch.

591
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,986
Come on. Watch this.

592
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:41,250
Everybody stay here.

593
00:49:59,478 --> 00:50:01,684
- Okay?
- Of course.

594
00:50:04,608 --> 00:50:08,440
Don't be scared. Come on, it's okay.
Muldoon tranquillised herfor me.

595
00:50:08,528 --> 00:50:09,809
She's sick.

596
00:50:18,705 --> 00:50:20,116
Oh, my God.

597
00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:45,185
She was always my favourite
when I was a kid...

598
00:50:45,273 --> 00:50:48,642
...and now I see
she's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.

599
00:50:52,989 --> 00:50:54,364
It's okay.

600
00:50:57,494 --> 00:51:00,067
Microvesicles. That's interesting.

601
00:51:02,081 --> 00:51:04,370
Thanks. What are her symptoms?

602
00:51:04,959 --> 00:51:07,711
Imbalance, disorientation,
laboured breathing.

603
00:51:07,879 --> 00:51:10,037
It seems to happen every six weeks or so.

604
00:51:10,131 --> 00:51:11,506
Six weeks.

605
00:51:25,146 --> 00:51:26,771
- These are dilated.
- They are?

606
00:51:26,856 --> 00:51:29,525
- Take a look.
- I'll be damned.

607
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:34,108
That's pharmacological.
From local plant life.

608
00:51:41,537 --> 00:51:43,660
Is this West Indian lilac?

609
00:51:44,123 --> 00:51:47,658
Yes. We know they're toxic,
but the animals don't eat them.

610
00:51:52,089 --> 00:51:54,924
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.

611
00:51:56,427 --> 00:51:58,669
There's only one way to be positive.

612
00:51:59,347 --> 00:52:01,884
I'd have to see the dinosaur's droppings.

613
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:06,178
Dino droppings? Droppings?

614
00:52:11,984 --> 00:52:13,775
Yeah, I got that.

615
00:52:15,279 --> 00:52:18,399
That storm centre hasn't dissipated
or changed course.

616
00:52:18,699 --> 00:52:20,941
We're gonna have to cut the tour short.

617
00:52:21,243 --> 00:52:23,035
We'll pick it up again tomorrow.

618
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:26,370
- Are you sure we have to?
- It's not worth taking the chance.

619
00:52:26,457 --> 00:52:30,075
- Sustained winds at 45 knots.
- Tell them when they get back in the cars.

620
00:52:30,169 --> 00:52:34,831
Ladies and gentlemen last shuttle leaving
for the dock leaves in five minutes.

621
00:52:34,923 --> 00:52:37,249
Drop what you're doing and leave now.

622
00:52:39,762 --> 00:52:40,924
Damn.

623
00:52:48,353 --> 00:52:50,263
That is one big pile of shit.

624
00:52:57,613 --> 00:53:00,234
You're right.
There's no trace of lilac berries.

625
00:53:00,324 --> 00:53:02,363
That's so odd, though.

626
00:53:02,826 --> 00:53:06,112
All right,
she's suffering from Melia toxicity...

627
00:53:08,165 --> 00:53:10,453
...every six weeks.

628
00:53:12,085 --> 00:53:15,620
Let's see, rats.

629
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:19,377
She's tenacious.

630
00:53:20,677 --> 00:53:22,385
You have no idea.

631
00:53:24,473 --> 00:53:28,387
You will remember to wash your hands
before you eat anything?

632
00:53:40,614 --> 00:53:44,528
Doctors, if you please,
I have to insist that we get moving.

633
00:53:46,953 --> 00:53:50,536
I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding
and finish up with the Trike.

634
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:53,082
Sure. I'm in a gas-powered jeep.

635
00:53:53,168 --> 00:53:55,919
I'll drop her off at the centre
before I make the boat.

636
00:53:56,004 --> 00:53:58,839
Great. Then I'll catch up with you later.

637
00:53:58,923 --> 00:53:59,872
You sure?

638
00:53:59,966 --> 00:54:02,753
Yeah, I want to stay
with her a little longer.

639
00:54:02,844 --> 00:54:04,255
Okay, then.

640
00:54:19,068 --> 00:54:23,066
<i>There's nothing I can do.
The captain says we have to go, we go.</i>

641
00:54:23,448 --> 00:54:25,156
You've got to give me time.

642
00:54:25,241 --> 00:54:28,906
I did a test run, it took me 20 minutes.
I think I can push it to 18 but...

643
00:54:28,995 --> 00:54:31,118
...you've got to give me
at least 15 minutes.

644
00:54:31,205 --> 00:54:32,534
<i>No promises.</i>

645
00:54:40,298 --> 00:54:42,871
Visitor vehicles are returning
to the garage.

646
00:54:45,219 --> 00:54:50,427
So much for ourfirst tour.
Two no-shows and one sick Triceratops.

647
00:54:51,642 --> 00:54:53,101
It could've been worse.

648
00:54:54,562 --> 00:54:55,842
A lot worse.

649
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:00,060
Anybody want a soda or something?
I'm going up to the machine.

650
00:55:00,151 --> 00:55:02,309
I thought maybe
I'd get somebody something.

651
00:55:02,403 --> 00:55:06,151
I've had only sweets
and I'm gonna get something salty.

652
00:55:06,991 --> 00:55:09,233
I finished de-bugging the phones.

653
00:55:10,536 --> 00:55:12,576
I was going to, so I did.

654
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:15,451
So I de-bugged the phones.
And I thought maybe...

655
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:18,710
...I should tell you the system
will be compiling...

656
00:55:18,794 --> 00:55:21,665
...for 18 to 20 minutes,
so some of the minor systems...

657
00:55:21,755 --> 00:55:25,374
...they might go on and off for a while,
but it's nothing to worry about.

658
00:55:47,698 --> 00:55:51,945
- Do you have any kids?
- Me? Hell, yeah. Three. I love kids.

659
00:55:53,912 --> 00:55:56,284
Anything at all can and does happen.

660
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:59,281
Same with wives, for that matter.

661
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:02,165
- You're married?
- Occasionally.

662
00:56:04,214 --> 00:56:08,591
I'm always on the lookout
for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.

663
00:56:22,149 --> 00:56:24,556
Five, four...

664
00:56:36,746 --> 00:56:39,035
- That's odd.
- What?

665
00:56:39,291 --> 00:56:41,449
Door security systems are shutting down.

666
00:56:41,793 --> 00:56:44,996
Nedry said a few systems
would go off-line, didn't he?

667
00:57:41,144 --> 00:57:42,970
By the way, Dr. Sattler...

668
00:57:44,147 --> 00:57:47,562
...she's not, like, available, is she?
- Why?

669
00:57:50,486 --> 00:57:53,273
- I'm sorry. You two are...
- Yeah.

670
00:57:56,659 --> 00:58:00,407
- What'd I touch?
- You didn't touch anything. We stopped.

671
00:58:09,296 --> 00:58:11,004
What the hell?

672
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:14,091
- What now?
- Fences are failing all over the park.

673
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:16,668
Find Nedry. Check the vending machines.

674
00:58:48,585 --> 00:58:50,661
Just look at this work station.

675
00:58:50,754 --> 00:58:54,254
- What a complete slob.
- The Raptorfences aren't out, are they?

676
00:59:01,265 --> 00:59:03,008
No, no. They're still on.

677
00:59:05,644 --> 00:59:08,182
Why the hell would he turn
the other ones off?

678
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:49,930
Access main program.

679
00:59:50,772 --> 00:59:52,432
Access main security.

680
00:59:53,191 --> 00:59:54,899
Access main program grid.

681
01:00:04,035 --> 01:00:06,111
<i>You didn't say the magic word.</i>

682
01:00:06,538 --> 01:00:10,072
Please! Goddamn it.
I hate this hacker crap.

683
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:13,458
Phone Nedry's people in Cambridge.

684
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,422
Phones are out, too.

685
01:00:20,969 --> 01:00:22,629
Where did the vehicles stop?

686
01:00:43,783 --> 01:00:45,194
Their radio's out, too.

687
01:00:45,827 --> 01:00:48,068
- Gennaro said to stay put.
- Kids okay?

688
01:00:48,246 --> 01:00:50,404
I didn't ask. Why wouldn't they be?

689
01:00:50,498 --> 01:00:52,206
- Kids get scared.
- What's scary?

690
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:55,376
- It's just a little hiccup in the power.
- I'm not scared.

691
01:00:55,503 --> 01:00:57,542
- I didn't say you were scared.
- I know.

692
01:01:01,175 --> 01:01:03,500
Hey, where did you find those?

693
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:06,341
- In the box, under my seat.
- Are they heavy?

694
01:01:06,806 --> 01:01:09,475
- Yeah.
- Then they're expensive. Put them back.

695
01:01:16,649 --> 01:01:18,226
Don't scare me.

696
01:01:29,787 --> 01:01:31,578
Cool. Night vision.

697
01:01:56,855 --> 01:01:58,314
Did you feel that?

698
01:02:32,265 --> 01:02:34,887
Maybe it's the power
trying to come back on.

699
01:02:37,521 --> 01:02:38,801
What is that?

700
01:02:55,956 --> 01:02:57,331
Where's the goat?

701
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:21,594
Jesus!

702
01:03:26,486 --> 01:03:28,277
He left us.

703
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:43,911
- Where does he think he's going?
- When you gotta go, you gotta go.

704
01:04:02,021 --> 01:04:03,301
Dr. Grant.

705
01:04:16,202 --> 01:04:18,325
I hate being right all the time.

706
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:31,960
Keep absolutely still.
Its vision is based on movement.

707
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:47,523
Turn the light off.

708
01:04:52,446 --> 01:04:53,905
Turn the light off!

709
01:05:49,753 --> 01:05:52,623
- Hurry! Turn it off!
- I'm sorry!

710
01:05:56,801 --> 01:05:58,794
You're the one who turned it...

711
01:07:17,798 --> 01:07:19,127
Ian, freeze!

712
01:07:19,633 --> 01:07:21,044
Get the kids!

713
01:07:22,011 --> 01:07:24,336
- Get rid of the flare!
- Get the kids!

714
01:07:25,347 --> 01:07:26,925
Get rid of the flare!

715
01:07:29,894 --> 01:07:31,720
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord be...

716
01:07:54,168 --> 01:07:55,413
Dr. Grant!

717
01:08:00,049 --> 01:08:02,622
I'm stuck. The seat's got my feet.

718
01:08:02,718 --> 01:08:05,007
I'll get you next. You're okay.

719
01:08:06,388 --> 01:08:07,763
You're all right.

720
01:08:08,515 --> 01:08:10,093
Tim. Tim!

721
01:08:13,812 --> 01:08:16,730
Don't move.
He can't see us if we don't move.

722
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:24,206
Lex! Lex, you're choking me.

723
01:09:27,051 --> 01:09:28,296
Grab the wire.

724
01:09:48,031 --> 01:09:51,898
"Keycheck space minus 0.
Keychecks off, safety space minus 0."

725
01:09:52,035 --> 01:09:55,238
He's turning the safety systems off.
Doesn't want anybody to see.

726
01:09:55,329 --> 01:09:58,533
Look at this next entry.
It's the kicker. "White rabbit object."

727
01:09:58,708 --> 01:10:02,658
It did it all. With the keychecks off,
the computer didn't file the keystrokes.

728
01:10:02,753 --> 01:10:06,454
The way to find them is to check
the computer's lines of code one by one.

729
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:09,757
- How many lines of code are there?
- About two million.

730
01:10:10,011 --> 01:10:11,421
- Two million?
- Yeah.

731
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:19,099
Robert, I wonder if perhaps you would
be good enough to take a gas jeep...

732
01:10:20,688 --> 01:10:22,930
...and bring back my grandchildren.

733
01:10:23,816 --> 01:10:24,847
Sure.

734
01:10:27,778 --> 01:10:29,272
I'm going with him.

735
01:10:32,616 --> 01:10:33,648
John.

736
01:10:39,623 --> 01:10:43,123
I can't get Jurassic Park back on-line
without Dennis Nedry.

737
01:11:03,272 --> 01:11:04,434
Damn it!

738
01:11:11,155 --> 01:11:12,565
There's the road!

739
01:11:19,121 --> 01:11:23,165
Winch this sucker off the thing
and then I tie it to the that thing there.

740
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:26,666
I'll pull down this thing here,
and pull it back up again.

741
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:38,421
My glasses. I can afford more glasses!

742
01:12:07,627 --> 01:12:10,961
You've got time. You can do it.
Do it. Come on, Dennis.

743
01:12:18,388 --> 01:12:19,419
Hello.

744
01:12:24,561 --> 01:12:27,348
Yeah, that's nice. I've got to go.

745
01:12:38,575 --> 01:12:39,903
Nice boy.

746
01:12:40,326 --> 01:12:41,405
Nice boy.

747
01:12:41,995 --> 01:12:43,619
Nice dinosaur.

748
01:12:44,455 --> 01:12:47,871
Thought you were one of your big brothers.
You're not so bad.

749
01:12:47,959 --> 01:12:51,873
What do you want? A little food?
Look at me. I just fell down a hill.

750
01:12:51,963 --> 01:12:55,462
I'm soaking wet. I don't have any food.
I have nothing on me.

751
01:12:56,843 --> 01:12:59,049
Go on. Play fetch?

752
01:13:01,222 --> 01:13:02,420
Look, stick.

753
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:06,258
Look at stick.

754
01:13:06,936 --> 01:13:09,853
Stick, stupid.
Fetch the stick, boy. Look at the stick.

755
01:13:10,606 --> 01:13:12,932
You like the stick? Go on and get it.

756
01:13:13,109 --> 01:13:14,936
No wonder you're extinct.

757
01:13:16,195 --> 01:13:18,437
I'm gonna run you over
when I come back down.

758
01:14:34,898 --> 01:14:36,476
Timmy!

759
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:42,610
Now, Lex. Listen.

760
01:14:43,323 --> 01:14:44,983
Lex, I'm right here.

761
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:48,114
I'll look after you.
I have to help your brother.

762
01:14:48,245 --> 01:14:50,451
Stay right here and wait for me.

763
01:14:50,831 --> 01:14:53,156
He left us.

764
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:56,158
But that's not what I'm going to do.

765
01:14:58,213 --> 01:14:59,244
Okay?

766
01:15:01,842 --> 01:15:02,956
Stay here.

767
01:15:30,203 --> 01:15:32,112
You hear me? I'm coming up.

768
01:15:32,831 --> 01:15:36,780
I hate climbing. I hate trees, way too high.

769
01:16:05,071 --> 01:16:06,150
You okay?

770
01:16:09,158 --> 01:16:10,403
I threw up.

771
01:16:13,538 --> 01:16:14,736
That's okay.

772
01:16:15,706 --> 01:16:17,414
Just give me your hand.

773
01:16:21,587 --> 01:16:25,632
Tim, I won't tell anyone you threw up.
Just give me your hand.

774
01:16:34,684 --> 01:16:36,012
Here, I've got you.

775
01:16:37,812 --> 01:16:38,843
Okay.

776
01:16:39,397 --> 01:16:43,228
- That's good. Over the rail.
- Don't pull me too hard.

777
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:50,022
Stand on the door. Hang on to me.

778
01:16:53,661 --> 01:16:56,365
- That's not too bad, right, Timmy?
- Yes, it is.

779
01:16:56,455 --> 01:16:59,160
It's like a tree house.
Your dad ever build you one?

780
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:00,792
- No.
- Yeah, me, too.

781
01:17:02,461 --> 01:17:05,248
The thing about climbing is,
you never look down.

782
01:17:05,339 --> 01:17:06,916
This is impossible.

783
01:17:07,216 --> 01:17:11,463
- How am I going to do this? It's about...
- I'm going to help you with yourfooting.

784
01:17:17,226 --> 01:17:18,257
Tim, go.

785
01:17:40,874 --> 01:17:42,333
Go, Tim, go!

786
01:17:50,634 --> 01:17:51,832
Faster, Tim!

787
01:17:58,558 --> 01:17:59,673
Tim, jump!

788
01:18:03,688 --> 01:18:04,768
Go, Tim.

789
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,647
We're back in the car again.

790
01:18:17,869 --> 01:18:19,945
At least you're out of the tree.

791
01:18:25,335 --> 01:18:26,959
Where's the other car?

792
01:18:30,215 --> 01:18:31,377
Alan!

793
01:18:32,509 --> 01:18:33,754
Dr. Grant!

794
01:18:49,901 --> 01:18:53,317
- I think this was Gennaro.
- I think this was, too.

795
01:18:56,908 --> 01:18:59,446
- I think it's ahead of us.
- It could be anywhere.

796
01:18:59,535 --> 01:19:02,904
With fences down,
it can wander in and out of any paddock.

797
01:19:09,921 --> 01:19:11,913
He's put a tourniquet on. Ian.

798
01:19:13,633 --> 01:19:16,337
Remind me to thank John
for a lovely weekend.

799
01:19:21,349 --> 01:19:23,092
Can we chance moving him?

800
01:19:24,435 --> 01:19:25,894
Please chance it.

801
01:19:34,445 --> 01:19:36,023
Ellie, come on!

802
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:44,658
The other car!

803
01:19:45,414 --> 01:19:46,659
Dr. Grant?

804
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:52,664
They're not here.

805
01:20:22,034 --> 01:20:23,528
Anybody hear that?

806
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:29,530
It's an impact tremor, is what it is.

807
01:20:30,417 --> 01:20:32,208
I'm fairly alarmed here.

808
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:36,340
Come on. We've got to get out of here.
Now!

809
01:20:38,175 --> 01:20:39,254
Let's go.

810
01:20:50,729 --> 01:20:52,009
Must go faster.

811
01:20:54,691 --> 01:20:57,526
Here it comes! Stand on it! Fifth gear!

812
01:21:03,867 --> 01:21:06,987
- Get off the stick! Bloody move!
- Look out!

813
01:21:34,105 --> 01:21:36,430
Think they'll have that on the tour?

814
01:21:44,616 --> 01:21:46,193
Are you hearing this?

815
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:54,949
Come on, Tim. Hurry up.

816
01:21:55,918 --> 01:21:57,626
Let's get up this tree.

817
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:03,341
Come on, Tim, it's okay.
Listen. Try up here.

818
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,009
I hate trees.

819
01:22:09,682 --> 01:22:13,300
- They don't bother me.
- Yeah? Well, you weren't in the last one.

820
01:22:27,825 --> 01:22:31,360
Look at the Brontosauruses.
I mean, Brachiosaurus.

821
01:22:32,913 --> 01:22:34,324
They're singing.

822
01:23:03,569 --> 01:23:05,396
Don't let the monsters come here.

823
01:23:05,487 --> 01:23:08,903
They're not monsters, they're animals.
These are herbivores.

824
01:23:09,158 --> 01:23:12,527
They only eat vegetables.
For you, I think they'd make an exception.

825
01:23:12,619 --> 01:23:14,279
I hate the other kind.

826
01:23:16,373 --> 01:23:19,160
The other kind just do what they do.

827
01:23:39,271 --> 01:23:40,469
What's that?

828
01:23:45,694 --> 01:23:49,478
What are you and Ellie going to do,
if you don't dig up bones anymore?

829
01:23:51,074 --> 01:23:52,319
I don't know.

830
01:23:53,577 --> 01:23:55,984
I guess we'll just have to evolve, too.

831
01:23:59,666 --> 01:24:01,872
What do you call a blind dinosaur?

832
01:24:03,879 --> 01:24:07,295
- What do you call a blind dinosaur?
- "Do-you-think-he-saurus."

833
01:24:11,595 --> 01:24:14,086
What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?

834
01:24:14,931 --> 01:24:16,094
You got me.

835
01:24:16,433 --> 01:24:18,425
A "Do-you-think-he-saurus' Rex."

836
01:24:21,146 --> 01:24:23,138
- Alan?
- Yeah?

837
01:24:23,982 --> 01:24:27,149
What if the dinosaurs come back
while we're all asleep?

838
01:24:29,446 --> 01:24:31,652
- I'll stay awake.
- All night?

839
01:24:34,242 --> 01:24:35,357
All night.

840
01:25:25,626 --> 01:25:27,251
They were all melting.

841
01:25:30,965 --> 01:25:34,085
Malcolm's okay for now.
I gave him a shot of morphine.

842
01:25:37,972 --> 01:25:39,514
They'll all be fine.

843
01:25:40,516 --> 01:25:44,810
Who better to get the children through
Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?

844
01:25:49,275 --> 01:25:51,066
You know, the first...

845
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:55,771
...attraction I ever built
when I came down from Scotland...

846
01:25:57,450 --> 01:25:59,941
...was a flea circus, Petticoat Lane.

847
01:26:01,328 --> 01:26:03,120
Really quite wonderful.

848
01:26:03,706 --> 01:26:06,956
I had a wee trapeze and a...

849
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:11,369
...carousel...

850
01:26:15,301 --> 01:26:16,711
...and a seesaw.

851
01:26:17,845 --> 01:26:20,051
They all move motorised, of course.

852
01:26:20,389 --> 01:26:23,094
People said they saw the fleas.
"I can see the fleas.

853
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:24,927
"Can't you see the fleas?"

854
01:26:25,686 --> 01:26:29,980
Clown fleas, high-wire fleas,
and fleas on parade.

855
01:26:36,196 --> 01:26:37,572
With this place...

856
01:26:39,783 --> 01:26:43,152
...I wanted to show them something
that wasn't an illusion.

857
01:26:44,162 --> 01:26:47,282
Something that was real.
Something that they could...

858
01:26:50,419 --> 01:26:51,877
...see and touch.

859
01:26:56,633 --> 01:26:59,041
An aim not devoid of merit.

860
01:27:03,557 --> 01:27:07,175
But you can't think through this one, John.
You have to feel it.

861
01:27:09,396 --> 01:27:11,139
You're absolutely right.

862
01:27:12,941 --> 01:27:15,230
Hiring Nedry was a mistake,
that's obvious.

863
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:18,065
We're overdependent on automation,
I can see that now.

864
01:27:18,154 --> 01:27:20,776
Next time, everything's correctable.

865
01:27:21,575 --> 01:27:24,778
Creation is an act of sheer will.

866
01:27:27,122 --> 01:27:29,079
Next time, it'll be flawless.

867
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:32,999
It's still the flea circus. It's all an illusion.

868
01:27:33,128 --> 01:27:34,622
When we have control...

869
01:27:34,713 --> 01:27:37,382
You've never had control!
That's the illusion.

870
01:27:37,549 --> 01:27:40,218
I was overwhelmed
by the power of this place.

871
01:27:41,636 --> 01:27:43,047
I made a mistake, too.

872
01:27:43,179 --> 01:27:46,963
I didn't have enough respect
for that power, and it's out now.

873
01:27:49,602 --> 01:27:52,769
The only thing that matters now
are the people we love.

874
01:27:54,941 --> 01:27:57,064
Alan, Lex, and Tim.

875
01:27:58,695 --> 01:28:01,814
John, they're out there,
where people are dying.

876
01:28:18,881 --> 01:28:19,996
It's good.

877
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:25,428
Spared no expense.

878
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:55,957
- Go away!
- It's okay. It's a Brachiosaurus.

879
01:28:56,627 --> 01:28:59,296
It's a "Veggie-saurus", Lex.
"Veggie-saurus."

880
01:28:59,839 --> 01:29:00,870
Veggie.

881
01:29:01,966 --> 01:29:03,757
Come on. Come on, girl.

882
01:29:07,972 --> 01:29:09,347
Come on, baby.

883
01:29:15,771 --> 01:29:17,265
I'm not letting go.

884
01:29:29,201 --> 01:29:32,036
- It looks like it has a cold.
- Yeah. Maybe.

885
01:29:32,413 --> 01:29:34,037
- Can I touch it?
- Sure.

886
01:29:34,373 --> 01:29:37,409
Just think of it as kind of a big cow.

887
01:29:40,796 --> 01:29:41,994
I like cows.

888
01:29:52,057 --> 01:29:54,382
Come on, girl. Come on up here, girl.

889
01:30:01,858 --> 01:30:03,103
God bless you.

890
01:30:09,491 --> 01:30:12,408
Great. Now she'll never try anything new.

891
01:30:12,953 --> 01:30:15,989
She'll sit in her room, never come out,
play on her computer.

892
01:30:16,081 --> 01:30:18,868
- I'm a hacker.
- That's what I said. You're a nerd.

893
01:30:18,959 --> 01:30:22,209
I am not a computer nerd.
I prefer to be called a hacker.

894
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:23,535
God.

895
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:30,134
You know what this is?

896
01:30:32,055 --> 01:30:34,048
It's a dinosaur egg.

897
01:30:34,766 --> 01:30:37,969
The dinosaurs are breeding.

898
01:30:41,147 --> 01:30:45,227
But my grandpa said
all the dinosaurs were girls.

899
01:30:46,611 --> 01:30:48,853
- Amphibian DNA.
- What's that?

900
01:30:52,742 --> 01:30:57,784
The film said they used frog DNA
to fill in the gene-sequence gaps.

901
01:30:57,872 --> 01:31:01,158
They mutated the dinosaur genetic code.

902
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:04,452
And blended it with that of frogs.

903
01:31:07,382 --> 01:31:11,842
Some West African frogs have been known
to change sex from male to female...

904
01:31:11,928 --> 01:31:13,967
...in a single sex environment.

905
01:31:15,973 --> 01:31:17,516
Malcolm was right.

906
01:31:18,935 --> 01:31:19,966
Look.

907
01:31:28,736 --> 01:31:30,444
Life found a way.

908
01:31:33,783 --> 01:31:37,780
That's crazy. You're out of your mind.
He's absolutely out of his mind.

909
01:31:38,037 --> 01:31:40,243
Wait. What exactly would this mean?

910
01:31:40,331 --> 01:31:44,198
We're talking about a calculated risk,
which is the only option left to us.

911
01:31:44,293 --> 01:31:48,706
We'll neverfind the command Nedry used.
He's covered his tracks far too well.

912
01:31:49,256 --> 01:31:52,092
I think it's obvious now
that he's not coming back.

913
01:31:52,176 --> 01:31:56,719
- So, shutting down the entire system...
- Get somebody else. I won't do it.

914
01:31:56,806 --> 01:32:02,013
Shutting down the system is the only way
to wipe out everything he did.

915
01:32:03,104 --> 01:32:06,686
Now, as I understand it,
all the systems will then come back...

916
01:32:06,857 --> 01:32:09,562
...on their original start-up mode. Correct?

917
01:32:10,110 --> 01:32:13,111
Theoretically, yes.
We've never shut down before.

918
01:32:13,197 --> 01:32:16,198
- It may not come back on.
- Would we get the phones back?

919
01:32:16,283 --> 01:32:17,908
Yes, again, in theory.

920
01:32:18,535 --> 01:32:21,951
What about the lysine contingency?
We could put that into effect.

921
01:32:22,039 --> 01:32:24,874
- What's that?
- That's absolutely out of the question.

922
01:32:24,958 --> 01:32:27,794
The lysine contingency
prevents the spread of animals...

923
01:32:27,878 --> 01:32:29,752
...if they ever get off the island.

924
01:32:29,838 --> 01:32:33,503
Wu inserted a gene that creates
a faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.

925
01:32:33,592 --> 01:32:36,510
The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid, lysine.

926
01:32:36,595 --> 01:32:40,344
Unless they're supplied with lysine by us,
they slip into a coma and die.

927
01:32:40,432 --> 01:32:42,888
People are dying.

928
01:32:47,105 --> 01:32:49,478
Will you please shut down the system?

929
01:33:11,505 --> 01:33:13,165
Hold on to your butts.

930
01:33:33,068 --> 01:33:34,182
It's okay.

931
01:33:34,319 --> 01:33:36,988
Look, see that? It's on. It worked.

932
01:33:39,491 --> 01:33:41,863
What do you mean it worked?
Everything's off.

933
01:33:41,951 --> 01:33:46,080
Shutdown tripped the circuit breakers.
Turn them back on, reboot a few systems:

934
01:33:46,164 --> 01:33:49,533
Telephones, security doors,
half dozen others, but it worked.

935
01:33:49,626 --> 01:33:52,033
- System's ready.
- Where are the breakers?

936
01:33:52,128 --> 01:33:53,836
The shed at end of the compound.

937
01:33:53,922 --> 01:33:56,673
Three minutes, I'll have the power back on
in the park.

938
01:33:56,758 --> 01:33:59,842
Just to be safe, I want everybody
in the emergency bunker...

939
01:33:59,928 --> 01:34:03,261
...until Mr. Arnold returns,
and the whole system's running again.

940
01:34:03,556 --> 01:34:05,679
- I'm tired. I'm hot.
- I'm dirty.

941
01:34:06,684 --> 01:34:10,349
Looking at the map,
I'd say the visitor's centre is just a mile...

942
01:34:11,105 --> 01:34:12,813
...over that rise there.

943
01:34:17,278 --> 01:34:18,309
What is that?

944
01:34:21,074 --> 01:34:23,280
Tim, can you tell me what they are?

945
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:31,578
Gallimimus.

946
01:34:31,667 --> 01:34:34,158
Are those meat-eating?

947
01:34:35,796 --> 01:34:37,077
"Meat-asauruses"?

948
01:34:42,094 --> 01:34:44,550
Look at the wheeling.
Uniform direction changes.

949
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:47,343
Just like a flock of birds
evading a predator.

950
01:34:48,851 --> 01:34:51,971
They're flocking this way.

951
01:35:34,938 --> 01:35:37,145
- I want to go now.
- Just look how it eats.

952
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:38,264
Please.

953
01:35:38,609 --> 01:35:41,360
I bet you'll never look at birds
the same way again.

954
01:35:41,445 --> 01:35:43,521
- Yes.
- Go now.

955
01:35:45,365 --> 01:35:48,035
Okay. Keep low and follow me.

956
01:35:50,454 --> 01:35:52,245
Look how much blood.

957
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:56,581
God. Something went wrong.

958
01:35:57,461 --> 01:36:00,995
Something's happened.
Something's wrong.

959
01:36:03,717 --> 01:36:05,295
This is just a delay.

960
01:36:05,385 --> 01:36:08,470
That's all it is.
All major theme parks have delays.

961
01:36:08,722 --> 01:36:13,051
When they opened Disneyland in 1956,
nothing worked.

962
01:36:13,477 --> 01:36:17,177
If the Pirates of the Caribbean
breaks down, the pirates don't eat tourists.

963
01:36:17,272 --> 01:36:22,148
I can't wait any more. Something's wrong.
I'm gonna go get the power back on.

964
01:36:22,444 --> 01:36:25,528
You can't just stroll down the road,
you know.

965
01:36:25,697 --> 01:36:28,983
Don't let's be too hasty.
I mean, he's only been gone...

966
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:33,701
- I'm going with you.
- Okay.

967
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:50,377
Sorry.

968
01:36:54,392 --> 01:36:58,639
Now, this isn't going to be just like
switching on the kitchen light.

969
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:02,140
But I think I can follow this
and then talk you through it.

970
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:07,733
Right.

971
01:37:13,786 --> 01:37:15,826
It ought to be me, really, going.

972
01:37:15,913 --> 01:37:18,749
- Why?
- I'm a... And you're a...

973
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:22,576
- Look.
- Come on, let's go.

974
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:25,920
We can discuss sexism
in survival situations when I get back.

975
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:29,625
You just take me through this step by step.
I'm on Channel 2.

976
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:09,382
The shutdown must've turned off
all the fences.

977
01:38:10,009 --> 01:38:13,674
Damn it, even Nedry knew better
than to mess with the Raptor pen.

978
01:38:19,643 --> 01:38:20,806
Come on, this way.

979
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:30,276
I can see the shed from here.

980
01:38:30,487 --> 01:38:32,231
We can make it if we run.

981
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:35,111
No. We can't.

982
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:37,066
Why not?

983
01:38:37,828 --> 01:38:39,785
Because we're being hunted.

984
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:43,116
In the bushes, straight ahead.

985
01:38:45,752 --> 01:38:47,033
It's all right.

986
01:38:47,629 --> 01:38:49,005
Like hell it is.

987
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:53,507
Run. Towards the shed.

988
01:38:55,721 --> 01:38:57,179
I've got her.

989
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:59,634
Go. Now!

990
01:39:18,827 --> 01:39:20,202
Mr. Arnold?

991
01:39:25,542 --> 01:39:26,787
John, I'm in.

992
01:39:27,377 --> 01:39:28,326
<i>Great.</i>

993
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:33,379
Ahead of you is a metal staircase.
Go down it.

994
01:39:34,426 --> 01:39:36,714
<i>Okay. Going down.</i>

995
01:39:37,637 --> 01:39:41,552
After 20 or 30 feet
you come to a T-junction. Take a left.

996
01:39:41,641 --> 01:39:44,761
- Have herfollow the main cable.
- I know how to read a schematic.

997
01:40:14,924 --> 01:40:17,131
I guess that means the power's off.

998
01:40:30,398 --> 01:40:33,019
- That's not funny.
- That was great.

999
01:40:35,528 --> 01:40:37,437
Well, maybe we, we could...

1000
01:40:55,298 --> 01:40:57,789
Damn it. Dead end.

1001
01:40:58,175 --> 01:40:59,420
Wait a minute.

1002
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:04,255
There should have been a right turn
back there somewhere.

1003
01:41:05,224 --> 01:41:06,173
Look above you.

1004
01:41:07,685 --> 01:41:11,552
<i>There should be a bundle of cable and
pipes all heading in the same direction.</i>

1005
01:41:11,647 --> 01:41:12,810
Follow that.

1006
01:41:13,482 --> 01:41:15,641
Okay. Following the piping.

1007
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:22,781
I bet I could climb over to the other side
before you could even get to the top.

1008
01:41:22,867 --> 01:41:25,192
- What would you give me?
- Respect.

1009
01:41:26,161 --> 01:41:28,201
Come on, guys, it's not a race.

1010
01:41:29,873 --> 01:41:31,118
I see the box.

1011
01:41:32,876 --> 01:41:34,584
It says, "High Voltage."

1012
01:41:38,966 --> 01:41:39,962
Okay.

1013
01:41:44,054 --> 01:41:46,723
Good. Here we go.

1014
01:41:47,391 --> 01:41:48,589
Over the top.

1015
01:41:49,226 --> 01:41:50,851
Take your time.

1016
01:41:51,854 --> 01:41:52,849
Good. Come on.

1017
01:41:53,605 --> 01:41:55,514
Find yourfooting.

1018
01:41:57,776 --> 01:42:00,481
You can't throw the main switch by hand.

1019
01:42:00,571 --> 01:42:03,986
You've got to pump up the primer handle
in order to get the charge.

1020
01:42:04,074 --> 01:42:06,399
It's large, flat and grey.

1021
01:42:07,202 --> 01:42:09,111
All right, here I go. Okay?

1022
01:42:10,622 --> 01:42:15,913
One, two, three, four.

1023
01:42:16,211 --> 01:42:17,836
Okay, charged.

1024
01:42:18,547 --> 01:42:22,331
Under the words "Contact Position,"
there's a round green button...

1025
01:42:22,634 --> 01:42:24,959
...which says "Push to Close."

1026
01:42:25,512 --> 01:42:27,339
Push to close.

1027
01:42:30,851 --> 01:42:31,846
Push it.

1028
01:42:47,075 --> 01:42:51,025
The red buttons turn on
the individual park systems.

1029
01:42:51,913 --> 01:42:53,076
Switch them on.

1030
01:43:04,717 --> 01:43:06,924
- Get down now!
- You're gonna have to jump.

1031
01:43:07,011 --> 01:43:08,755
You crazy? I'm not gonna jump.

1032
01:43:08,930 --> 01:43:11,551
- Do what Dr. Grant says!
- Let go. I'll count to three.

1033
01:43:11,641 --> 01:43:14,049
One, two, three!

1034
01:43:18,147 --> 01:43:19,891
I'm coming up to get you.

1035
01:43:19,983 --> 01:43:21,477
I've got to get Tim.

1036
01:43:21,901 --> 01:43:23,645
Okay. I'm gonna count to three.

1037
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:27,235
One...

1038
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:30,279
...two...

1039
01:43:41,379 --> 01:43:42,541
He's not breathing.

1040
01:43:47,802 --> 01:43:50,174
I think we're back in business!

1041
01:45:29,986 --> 01:45:31,231
Clever girl.

1042
01:45:55,553 --> 01:45:56,585
No, Tim!

1043
01:45:59,599 --> 01:46:01,473
Good boy.

1044
01:46:06,064 --> 01:46:07,262
Three.

1045
01:46:12,445 --> 01:46:13,524
Hello?

1046
01:46:25,375 --> 01:46:27,533
I'm gonna have to find the others.

1047
01:46:28,211 --> 01:46:30,962
Get you to a doctor.

1048
01:46:33,007 --> 01:46:35,296
- Lex, you look after Tim.
- Yeah.

1049
01:46:36,594 --> 01:46:38,551
Your hair is all sticking up.

1050
01:46:40,556 --> 01:46:42,845
Big Tim, the human piece of toast.

1051
01:46:47,146 --> 01:46:49,305
I'll be back soon. I promise.

1052
01:47:16,634 --> 01:47:17,630
Run.

1053
01:48:34,252 --> 01:48:36,162
Just the two Raptors, right?

1054
01:48:37,672 --> 01:48:39,546
You sure the third one's contained?

1055
01:48:39,633 --> 01:48:43,215
Yes, unless they figure out
how to open doors.

1056
01:49:09,829 --> 01:49:12,996
- What is it?
- It's a Velociraptor.

1057
01:49:15,793 --> 01:49:17,288
It's inside.

1058
01:49:42,862 --> 01:49:43,941
Follow me.

1059
01:52:19,517 --> 01:52:20,762
It's in there.

1060
01:52:21,644 --> 01:52:22,889
Control room.

1061
01:52:29,235 --> 01:52:32,521
- We can call for help?
- We've got to reboot the system first.

1062
01:52:35,366 --> 01:52:36,564
The door locks!

1063
01:52:37,577 --> 01:52:39,616
Ellie, boot up the door locks!

1064
01:52:49,130 --> 01:52:50,957
No, boot up the door locks!

1065
01:52:52,008 --> 01:52:55,840
- Get back! Boot up the door locks.
- You can't hold it by yourself!

1066
01:53:04,270 --> 01:53:07,769
It's a UNIX system. I know this.

1067
01:53:08,524 --> 01:53:10,600
It's all the files of the whole park.

1068
01:53:10,693 --> 01:53:13,943
It tells you everything.
I've got to find the right file.

1069
01:53:14,697 --> 01:53:16,274
Try to reach the gun.

1070
01:53:24,790 --> 01:53:26,747
I can't get it unless I move.

1071
01:53:42,558 --> 01:53:45,131
This is it. This might be the right file.

1072
01:54:00,784 --> 01:54:02,362
- You got it!
- Yes!

1073
01:54:13,088 --> 01:54:14,119
What works?

1074
01:54:14,214 --> 01:54:16,919
All security systems are enabled.
We got it!

1075
01:54:26,810 --> 01:54:27,675
Grant.

1076
01:54:28,103 --> 01:54:31,020
Mr. Hammond, the phones are working.

1077
01:54:31,523 --> 01:54:34,358
<i>- The children all right?
- The children are fine.</i>

1078
01:54:34,735 --> 01:54:38,104
Call the mainland.
Tell 'em to send the damn helicopters.

1079
01:54:39,322 --> 01:54:40,947
It's gonna cut through the glass!

1080
01:55:35,545 --> 01:55:36,410
Move!

1081
01:57:39,835 --> 01:57:44,128
After careful consideration,
I've decided not to endorse your park.

1082
01:57:44,923 --> 01:57:46,121
So have I.
