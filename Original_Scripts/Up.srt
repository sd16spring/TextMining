Skip to the end!

161
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:29,512
See these? These are my
wilderness explorer badges.

162
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:31,646
You may notice one is missing.

163
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:34,065
It's my "Assisting
the elderly badge".

164
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,314
If I get it, I'll become a
senior wilderness explorer!

165
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:43,109
The wilderness
must be explored!

166
00:16:45,653 --> 00:16:46,536
It's gonna be great!

167
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:49,532
There is a big ceremony
and all the dads come and...

168
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:51,284
we pin on our badges...

169
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:54,245
- So you wanna assist an old person.
- Yeah!

170
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,165
Then I'll be a senior
wilderness explorer!

171
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,711
- Have you ever heard of a "snipe"?
- "Snipe"?

172
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:03,386
A bird. Big eyes.

173
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:05,757
Every night it
sneaks into my yard

174
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,092
and gobbles my poor azaleas.

175
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,053
I'm elderly and infirm.

176
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:11,728
I can't catch it.

177
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:14,641
- If only someone could help me...
- Me, me, I'll do it!

178
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:16,976
I don't know, it's
awfully crafty.

179
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:19,229
You'd have to clap
your hands three times

180
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:20,320
to lure it in.

181
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:21,821
I'll find her,
mr. Fredricksen!

182
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:23,942
I think its burrow
is two blocks down...

183
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,485
Two blocks down. Got it!

184
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,413
Snipe! Here, snipie, snipie...

185
00:17:30,448 --> 00:17:32,367
Bring it back here
when you find it!

186
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:33,910
Snipe!

187
00:17:37,205 --> 00:17:39,624
And stop. Stop. Stop!

188
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,960
Hey, hey!

189
00:17:42,001 --> 00:17:46,214
Hey, you! What do you
think you're doing?

190
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:47,774
I am so sorry, sir.

191
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:49,265
Don't touch that!

192
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,635
No, no, no, let me take
care of that for you.

193
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,809
Get away from our mailbox!

194
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:53,888
- Sir...
- I don't want you to touch that!

195
00:18:09,445 --> 00:18:10,822
It looks bad.

196
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:34,095
<i><b>COURT SUMMONS</b></i>

197
00:18:42,645 --> 00:18:43,938
Sorry, mr. Fredricksen.

198
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:47,150
You don't seem like
a public menace to me.

199
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:48,866
Take this.

200
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:51,821
The guys from "Shady Oaks" will be
by to pick you up in the morning, ok?

201
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:08,880
What do I do now, Ellie?

202
00:20:39,011 --> 00:20:40,311
Good morning, gentlemen.

203
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:42,056
Good morning, mr. Fredricksen.

204
00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:43,349
You're ready to go?

205
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:46,859
Ready as I'll ever be.

206
00:20:46,894 --> 00:20:48,917
Would you do me the
favour and take this?

207
00:20:48,952 --> 00:20:50,905
I'll meet you in the
van in just a minute.

208
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,695
I... wanna say one last
goodbye to the old place.

209
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,322
Sure. Take all the
time you need, sir.

210
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:05,204
That's typical. He's probably going
to the bathroom for the 80th time.

211
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:10,209
You'd think he'd take
better care of his house.

212
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,383
So long, boys!

213
00:21:52,418 --> 00:21:57,548
I'll send you a postcard
from Paradise Falls!

214
00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:56,107
<i><b>SOUTH AMERICA</b></i>

215
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,012
We are on our way, Ellie.

216
00:24:35,831 --> 00:24:37,395
Hi, mr. Fredricksen.

217
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,959
It's me, Russell.

218
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:41,451
What are you doing
out here, kid?

219
00:24:41,486 --> 00:24:45,115
I found the snipe and I
followed it under your porch.

220
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,666
But this snipe had a long tail

221
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:50,579
and looked more
like a large mouse.

222
00:24:56,251 --> 00:24:58,253
Please, let me in.

223
00:24:58,295 --> 00:25:01,465
No.

224
00:25:03,842 --> 00:25:06,344
Aw, all right. You can...

225
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:08,472
come... in.

226
00:25:18,273 --> 00:25:20,567
I've never been in a
floating house before.

227
00:25:22,027 --> 00:25:24,488
Goggles...
Look at this stuff!

228
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,371
Are you going on a trip?

229
00:25:26,406 --> 00:25:29,875
"Paradise Falls, a
land lost in time".

230
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,037
Are you going to South
America, mr. Fredricksen?

231
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,223
Don't touch that!
You'll soil it.

232
00:25:34,258 --> 00:25:36,374
You know, most
people take a plane.

233
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,591
But you're smart,

234
00:25:37,626 --> 00:25:39,669
because you have your
TV, clocks and stuff.

235
00:25:39,711 --> 00:25:41,963
Ooo, is this how
you steer your house?

236
00:25:42,756 --> 00:25:46,426
Does it really work?

237
00:25:46,718 --> 00:25:51,223
This makes it turn right
and that way is left.

238
00:25:51,306 --> 00:25:54,024
Hey, look! Buildings!

239
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:57,938
That building's so close,
I can almost touch it!

240
00:25:59,356 --> 00:26:02,532
Wow, this is great!

241
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:04,618
You should try this,
mr. Fredricksen.

242
00:26:04,653 --> 00:26:07,781
Look, there's a bus that could
take me home two blocks away!

243
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,700
Hey, I can see your
house from here!

244
00:26:11,743 --> 00:26:13,578
Don't jerk around
so much, kid!

245
00:26:13,828 --> 00:26:17,297
Well, that's not gonna work.

246
00:26:17,332 --> 00:26:20,710
I know that cloud,
it's a "cumulonimbus".

247
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,964
Did you know that
a cumulonimbus...

248
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:29,302
Aaa, I stayed up all night
blowing up ballons... for what?

249
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,263
That's nice, kid.

250
00:26:37,894 --> 00:26:41,147
What are you doing over there?

251
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,317
Look!

252
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:56,246
See? Cumulonimbus.

253
00:27:31,656 --> 00:27:33,033
My bag!

254
00:27:38,455 --> 00:27:39,497
Got you!

255
00:28:15,742 --> 00:28:18,495
Uuu, I thought you were dead.

256
00:28:21,414 --> 00:28:22,464
What happened?

257
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:25,752
I steered us. I did
it! I steered the house.

258
00:28:25,794 --> 00:28:27,218
You steered us?

259
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:29,923
After you tied your stuff
down, you took a nap.

260
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:33,218
So I went ahead and
steered us down here.

261
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,930
Yeah, sure.

262
00:28:46,272 --> 00:28:48,948
I can't tell where we are.

263
00:28:48,983 --> 00:28:50,742
O, we're in South
America all right.

264
00:28:50,777 --> 00:28:54,614
It was a singe. I used my
wilderness explorer GPS.

265
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,789
GP... what?

266
00:28:55,824 --> 00:28:57,290
My dad gave it to me.

267
00:28:57,325 --> 00:29:01,871
It shows exactly where
we are on the planet.

268
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:06,626
With this baby
we'll never be lost!

269
00:29:06,668 --> 00:29:10,505
Ups.

270
00:29:12,173 --> 00:29:16,267
We'll get you down,
find a bus stop,

271
00:29:16,302 --> 00:29:19,597
and you'll just tell the man you
want to get back to your mother.

272
00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:23,226
Sure, but I don't think they
have buses in Paradise Falls.

273
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:26,361
There, that ought to do it.

274
00:29:26,396 --> 00:29:29,774
There, I'll give you some
change for the bus fare.

275
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,443
No, I'll just use
my city bus pass.

276
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:38,700
It's just gonna be like a billion
passes to get back to my house.

277
00:29:43,454 --> 00:29:44,998
Mr. Fredricksen,
how much longer?

278
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,538
Well, we're up pretty high.

279
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:50,044
It'll take hours to get down.

280
00:29:52,338 --> 00:29:54,549
I think that was a
building or something.

281
00:29:56,509 --> 00:29:58,226
What was that,
mr. Fredricksen?

282
00:29:58,261 --> 00:30:02,056
We can't be close
to the ground yet.

283
00:30:10,623 --> 00:30:12,499
Wait, no, no!

284
00:30:14,084 --> 00:30:15,544
Wait, wait!

285
00:30:19,215 --> 00:30:22,676
Hang on!

286
00:30:34,855 --> 00:30:36,982
Pull back!

287
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:53,213
Where... where are we?

288
00:30:53,248 --> 00:30:57,461
This doesn't look like the city
or the jungle, mr. Fredricksen.

289
00:30:58,212 --> 00:31:03,509
Don't worry,
Ellie. I've got it.

290
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:32,037
There it is!

291
00:31:57,646 --> 00:32:00,983
Ellie, it's so beautiful!

292
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:03,283
We made it!

293
00:32:03,318 --> 00:32:07,030
We made it! Russell, we
can float right over there.

294
00:32:07,065 --> 00:32:08,997
Climb up, climb up!

295
00:32:09,032 --> 00:32:10,165
Do you mean... assist you?

296
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,286
- Yeah, whatever.
- Ok, I'll climb up!

297
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:19,751
- Watch it!
- Sorry.

298
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,430
When you get up there,
go ahead and hoist me up.

299
00:32:32,806 --> 00:32:34,349
Got it?

300
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:39,813
Are you on the porch yet?

301
00:32:46,695 --> 00:32:48,162
What? That's it?

302
00:32:48,197 --> 00:32:53,869
I came all this way here to get stuck
on the wrong end of this rock pile?

303
00:32:55,829 --> 00:32:58,207
Ah... great.

304
00:33:00,334 --> 00:33:03,462
Hey, if I could assist
you over there...

305
00:33:03,497 --> 00:33:06,506
would you sign
up for my badge?

306
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:07,973
What are you talking about?

307
00:33:08,008 --> 00:33:10,177
We could walk your
house to the fall.

308
00:33:10,477 --> 00:33:12,179
- Walk it?
- Yeah.

309
00:33:12,221 --> 00:33:15,974
After all we weigh it down, we
could walk it right over there.

310
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:18,185
Like a parade balloon.

311
00:33:22,231 --> 00:33:25,525
Now, we'll walk to the
falls quickly and quietly,

312
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,784
with no rap music
or flash dancing.

313
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:32,491
We have three days at best till the
helium leaks out of those balloons.

314
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:35,661
And if we are not at the
falls when that happens...

315
00:33:35,696 --> 00:33:37,955
we're not getting
to the falls.

316
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,245
There... I found sand!

317
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,466
Don't you worry, Ellie.

318
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:44,753
We'll get our
house over there.

319
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:51,218
It is fun already, isn't it?

320
00:33:51,253 --> 00:33:53,095
By the time we get there,

321
00:33:53,136 --> 00:33:56,723
You're gonna feel so
assisted... Oh, mr. Fredricksen,

322
00:33:56,758 --> 00:33:59,013
if we happen to get separated,

323
00:33:59,048 --> 00:34:01,269
use the wilderness
explorer call.

324
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,526
Wait, why are we going
to Paradise Falls, again?

325
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:09,159
Hey, let's play a game.

326
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:12,864
It's called: "See who
can be quiet the longest".

327
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:15,200
Cool! My mom loves that game!

328
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:21,516
Darn thing...

329
00:35:21,558 --> 00:35:23,727
Come on, Russell, hurry it up.

330
00:35:23,762 --> 00:35:25,684
Ah, I'm tired.

331
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,851
My knee hurts.

332
00:35:27,886 --> 00:35:29,983
Which knee?

333
00:35:30,025 --> 00:35:34,321
My elbow hurts and I have
to go to the bathroom.

334
00:35:34,356 --> 00:35:36,907
I asked you about
that five minutes ago.

335
00:35:36,942 --> 00:35:40,553
I didn't have to go then!

336
00:35:40,588 --> 00:35:44,164
I don't wanna walk anymore...

337
00:35:44,206 --> 00:35:47,215
Please, stop...

338
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,878
Russell, if you don't hurry
up, the tigers will eat you.

339
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:52,631
There are no tigers
in South America.

340
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:56,801
Zoology.

341
00:35:56,843 --> 00:36:00,013
Ah, for the love of Pete... Go on
into the bushes and do your business.

342
00:36:00,048 --> 00:36:03,683
Ok. Here! Hold my stuff!

343
00:36:03,808 --> 00:36:06,520
I've always
wanted to try this.

344
00:36:09,814 --> 00:36:15,237
Mr. Fredricksen, am I suppose
to dig the hole before or after?

345
00:36:15,272 --> 00:36:18,532
That's none of my concern.

346
00:36:18,573 --> 00:36:21,618
Oh, it's "before"!

347
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:30,752
Tracks?

348
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,678
Snipe.

349
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:36,556
Here, snipe.

350
00:36:36,591 --> 00:36:38,718
Come on out, snipe.

351
00:36:38,753 --> 00:36:41,137
Snipe!

352
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:03,994
Got you. Don't be
afraid, little snipe.

353
00:37:04,029 --> 00:37:05,794
I am a wilderness explorer,

354
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:08,790
so I'm a friend
to all of nature.

355
00:37:08,825 --> 00:37:13,545
Want some more?

356
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,922
Hi, boy. Don't eat it all.

357
00:37:15,957 --> 00:37:17,799
Come on out.

358
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:22,268
Come on. Come on...

359
00:37:22,303 --> 00:37:24,847
Don't be afraid, little snipe.

360
00:37:24,882 --> 00:37:27,392
Nice snipe. Good little snipe.

361
00:37:27,427 --> 00:37:31,855
Nice giant... snipe!

362
00:37:35,608 --> 00:37:38,194
I found the snipe.

363
00:37:38,229 --> 00:37:40,829
Oh, did you?

364
00:37:40,864 --> 00:37:42,657
- Are they tall?
- Oh, yes. They're very tall.

365
00:37:42,692 --> 00:37:44,242
Do they have a lot of colors?

366
00:37:44,277 --> 00:37:45,750
They do, indeed.

367
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:48,288
- Do they like chocolate?
- Oh, yeah...

368
00:37:48,323 --> 00:37:51,583
Chocolate?

369
00:37:51,624 --> 00:37:53,835
What is that thing?

370
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,927
It's a snipe.

371
00:37:55,962 --> 00:37:58,548
There no such
thing as a snipe!

372
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:01,509
But you said...

373
00:38:01,551 --> 00:38:04,262
Go on, get out of here! Go!

374
00:38:13,229 --> 00:38:16,281
Careful, Russell.

375
00:38:16,316 --> 00:38:19,861
Look, mr. Fredricksen,
he likes me.

376
00:38:19,903 --> 00:38:23,406
- Russell!
- No, stop! That tickles!

377
00:38:23,441 --> 00:38:26,117
Get out of here!
Go on! Get!

378
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:36,815
No, no, no. Kevin, it's ok.

379
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:40,054
Mr. Fredricksen is nice.

380
00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:42,634
- Kevin?
- Yes, that's the name I just gave him.

381
00:38:42,801 --> 00:38:44,990
Bit it, boo, scram!

382
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:47,180
Hey, that's mine!

383
00:38:51,476 --> 00:38:54,145
Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

384
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,397
Go on, bit it!

385
00:39:02,153 --> 00:39:04,537
Can we keep him? Please?

386
00:39:04,572 --> 00:39:07,200
I'll get the food for him, I'll walk
him, I'll change his newspapers...

387
00:39:07,235 --> 00:39:09,202
No.

388
00:39:09,285 --> 00:39:11,961
An explorer is
a friend to all,

389
00:39:11,996 --> 00:39:14,040
be it a plant, a
fish or a tiny mole.

390
00:39:14,082 --> 00:39:16,459
That doesn't even rhyme.

391
00:39:16,494 --> 00:39:18,419
Yeah, it does.

392
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:20,303
- Hey, look, Kevin.
- What?

393
00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:23,299
Hey, get down from there!
You're not allowed up there!

394
00:39:25,468 --> 00:39:30,223
You come down here right now!

395
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,561
Can you believe this, Ellie?

396
00:39:34,596 --> 00:39:37,570
Ellie?

397
00:39:37,605 --> 00:39:40,024
Hey, Ellie, can
I keep the bird?

398
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:42,610
Aha.

399
00:39:42,652 --> 00:39:45,370
She said for you to let me.

400
00:39:45,405 --> 00:39:47,782
But I told him
no. I told you no.

401
00:39:47,817 --> 00:39:50,159
N
- o!

402
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:03,131
I see you, back there.

403
00:40:05,091 --> 00:40:08,469
Go on, get out of here! Shoo! Go
annoy someone else for a while.

404
00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:11,306
Hey, are you ok over there?

405
00:40:13,474 --> 00:40:16,853
Hello?

406
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:24,709
Oh, hello, sir.
Thank Goodness.

407
00:40:24,744 --> 00:40:27,663
It's nice to know
someone else is up here.

408
00:40:27,698 --> 00:40:29,415
I can smell you.

409
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,674
What?

410
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:34,524
You can... smell us?

411
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:37,340
I can smell you.

412
00:40:44,472 --> 00:40:47,683
- Hey!
- You were talking to a rock.

413
00:40:47,718 --> 00:40:50,895
Hey, that one
looks like a turtle.

414
00:40:50,936 --> 00:40:53,272
Look at that one! That
one looks like a dog!

415
00:40:54,148 --> 00:40:57,033
- Ah, it is a dog.
- What?

416
00:40:57,068 --> 00:41:00,988
We're not allowed to have
dogs in my appartment.

417
00:41:01,155 --> 00:41:04,679
Hey, I like dogs!

418
00:41:04,714 --> 00:41:08,169
We have your dog!

419
00:41:08,204 --> 00:41:09,872
- I wonder whom he belongs to.
- Sit, boy.

420
00:41:09,907 --> 00:41:11,665
Hey, look, he's trained!

421
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,715
Shake.

422
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,606
Aha. Speak.

423
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:16,462
Hi, there.

424
00:41:16,962 --> 00:41:19,340
Did that dog just
say "Hi, there"?

425
00:41:19,375 --> 00:41:21,258
Oh, yes!

426
00:41:21,384 --> 00:41:24,678
My name is Dug. I just
met you and I love you.

427
00:41:24,887 --> 00:41:27,563
My master made me this collar.

428
00:41:27,598 --> 00:41:31,018
He is a good and smart master
and he made me this collar

429
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:33,580
so that I may talk. Squirrel!

430
00:41:33,615 --> 00:41:36,107
My master is good and smart.

431
00:41:36,142 --> 00:41:37,406
It's not possible.

432
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:39,422
It is because my
master is smart.

433
00:41:39,457 --> 00:41:41,403
Hey, cool! What
do these do, boy?

434
00:41:41,438 --> 00:41:44,163
<i>Would you cut...</i>

435
00:41:44,198 --> 00:41:47,535
<i>I'd use that collar... I
would be happy if you stopped.</i>

436
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,752
Russell, don't touch that.

437
00:41:49,787 --> 00:41:51,712
It could be...
radioactive or something.

438
00:41:51,747 --> 00:41:54,083
I am a great tracker. My master
sent me on a special mission.

439
00:41:54,118 --> 00:41:56,592
All by myself. Have
you seen a bird?

440
00:41:56,627 --> 00:41:58,983
I want to find one and
I've been on a scent.

441
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:01,340
I'm a great tracker.
Did I mention that?

442
00:42:03,175 --> 00:42:07,054
Hey, that is a bird. I have
never seen one up close,

443
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:08,562
but this is the bird.

444
00:42:08,597 --> 00:42:10,891
May I take your bird up
to camp as my prisoner?

445
00:42:10,926 --> 00:42:12,441
Yes, yes, take it.

446
00:42:12,476 --> 00:42:14,728
And on the way, learn how
to bark like a real dog.

447
00:42:14,763 --> 00:42:16,487
I can bark.

448
00:42:16,522 --> 00:42:18,649
And here's howling.

449
00:42:20,734 --> 00:42:24,113
Can we keep him, please?
Please, please, please?

450
00:42:24,148 --> 00:42:27,491
- No.
- But it's a talking dog!

451
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:29,618
It's just a weird
trick or something.

452
00:42:29,653 --> 00:42:31,787
Let's get to the fall.

453
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:36,917
Please, be my prisoner! Oh,
please oh, please, be my prisoner!

454
00:42:38,836 --> 00:42:40,921
Oh, here it is! I picked
up the bird's scent!

455
00:42:40,956 --> 00:42:43,007
Wait a minute, wait a
minute. What is this?

456
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,516
Chocolate. I smell chocolate.

457
00:42:45,551 --> 00:42:48,596
I'm getting prunes
and ginger cream.

458
00:42:48,631 --> 00:42:49,895
Who are they?

459
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:52,565
Oh, man, the master
will not be pleased.

460
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,437
We'd better tell him someone
took the bird, right, Alfa?

461
00:42:56,604 --> 00:42:58,404
No.

462
00:42:58,439 --> 00:43:01,358
Soon enough the bird
will be ours again.

463
00:43:01,393 --> 00:43:02,408
Find the scent, my compadres,

464
00:43:02,443 --> 00:43:05,946
and you, too, shall have
much rewarding from the master

465
00:43:05,981 --> 00:43:07,871
for the toil that you did.

466
00:43:07,906 --> 00:43:12,369
Hey, Alfa, I think there's
something wrong with your collar.

467
00:43:12,404 --> 00:43:15,337
You must have broken it.

468
00:43:15,372 --> 00:43:19,501
Yeah. Your voice sounds funny.

469
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:20,669
Beta, Delta!

470
00:43:20,711 --> 00:43:25,014
Perhaps you
desire... Squirrel!

471
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:27,551
Perhaps you desire to
challenge the right that

472
00:43:27,586 --> 00:43:30,054
I have been assigned by
my strength and cunning.

473
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:32,354
No, no. No.

474
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:35,288
But maybe Dug would.

475
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:38,187
You might wanna ask him.

476
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:41,106
I wonder if he's found the bird
on his "very special mission".

477
00:43:41,141 --> 00:43:43,240
Do not mention Dug
to me at this time.

478
00:43:43,275 --> 00:43:46,737
His fool's errand will
keep him most occupied...

479
00:43:46,772 --> 00:43:49,163
Most occupied, indeed.

480
00:43:49,198 --> 00:43:51,790
Do you not agree with that
which I'm saying to you now?

481
00:43:51,825 --> 00:43:56,747
Sure. But the second the master finds
out that you sent Dug out by himself,

482
00:43:56,782 --> 00:43:59,958
none of us will get a treat.

483
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,211
You're unwise, my
trusted lieutenant.

484
00:44:03,246 --> 00:44:05,752
This is Alfa. Calling
Dug. Come in, Dug.

485
00:44:05,787 --> 00:44:08,258
<i>Hi, Alfa. Your
voice sounds funny.</i>

486
00:44:08,293 --> 00:44:10,601
I know, I know!

487
00:44:10,636 --> 00:44:13,270
Have you seen the bird?

488
00:44:13,305 --> 00:44:15,432
<i>Oh, yes. The bird
is my prisoner now.</i>

489
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:17,684
Yeah, right.

490
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,569
Impossible. Where are you?

491
00:44:20,604 --> 00:44:23,732
<i>I am here with the bird
and I will bring it back</i>

492
00:44:23,767 --> 00:44:25,442
<i>and then you like
me. Oh, gotta go.</i>

493
00:44:25,477 --> 00:44:27,284
<i>Dug, who are you talking to?</i>

494
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:29,342
- Wait, wait!
- What is Dug doing?

495
00:44:29,377 --> 00:44:31,365
Why is he with
the small mailman?

496
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,488
Where are they?

497
00:44:33,523 --> 00:44:35,593
There he is.

498
00:44:35,628 --> 00:44:37,663
Come on!

499
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,003
Please, oh, please,
be my prisoner.

500
00:44:45,038 --> 00:44:47,554
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

501
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:49,466
That man over there
says I can take the bird.

502
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:51,343
And I love that man there
like he is my master.

503
00:44:51,385 --> 00:44:53,519
I am not your master!

504
00:44:53,554 --> 00:44:55,270
I am warning you
once again, bird!

505
00:44:55,305 --> 00:44:57,266
- Hey, quit it!
- I am jumping on you now, bird!

506
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,518
At this rate we will
never get to the falls!

507
00:45:06,775 --> 00:45:09,493
I am nobody's master, got it?

508
00:45:09,528 --> 00:45:11,822
I don't want you here
and I don't want you here!

509
00:45:11,857 --> 00:45:14,456
I'm stuck with you!

510
00:45:14,491 --> 00:45:16,535
If you two don't clear out of here
by the time I count to three...

511
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:19,705
A ball! Oh, boy,
oh, boy, a ball!

512
00:45:19,746 --> 00:45:22,749
Ball? You want a ball?

513
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,545
Yes, I do! I ever
so want the ball!

514
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:27,302
Go get it!

515
00:45:27,337 --> 00:45:29,590
Oh, boy, I will get it
and then bring it back!

516
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:32,467
Quick, Russell, give
me some chocolate.

517
00:45:32,502 --> 00:45:34,011
- Why?
- Just give to me!

518
00:45:34,046 --> 00:45:35,888
Bird! Bird!

519
00:45:36,013 --> 00:45:39,141
Come on, Russell.

520
00:45:39,474 --> 00:45:42,644
Wait! Wait, mr. Fredricksen!

521
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:49,318
What are you doing?

522
00:45:53,405 --> 00:45:56,658
Hey, we're pretty far now.

523
00:45:56,693 --> 00:45:58,660
Kevin's gonna miss.

524
00:46:03,415 --> 00:46:07,044
I think that did the trick.

525
00:46:07,252 --> 00:46:09,713
Hi, master.

526
00:46:09,755 --> 00:46:12,174
Afternoon.

527
00:46:36,114 --> 00:46:40,410
Well, thanks for keeping
us dry, anyway, Ellie.

528
00:46:40,445 --> 00:46:42,996
Which one is the front?

529
00:46:43,038 --> 00:46:45,672
Well, boy...

530
00:46:45,707 --> 00:46:50,253
Is this step
three or step five?

531
00:46:50,337 --> 00:46:52,506
There.

532
00:46:55,676 --> 00:47:00,055
All done. That's for you.

533
00:47:05,268 --> 00:47:08,111
Well, tents are hard.

534
00:47:08,146 --> 00:47:11,024
Wait, aren't you
super wilderness guy

535
00:47:11,059 --> 00:47:13,610
with the GPS and the badges?

536
00:47:13,645 --> 00:47:15,404
Yeah, but...

537
00:47:15,654 --> 00:47:18,663
Can I tell you a secret?

538
00:47:18,698 --> 00:47:21,708
- No.
- All right. Here it goes.

539
00:47:21,743 --> 00:47:25,288
I never actually built a
tent before. There! I said it.

540
00:47:25,455 --> 00:47:28,375
You've been camping
before, haven't you?

541
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:31,468
Well, never outside...

542
00:47:31,503 --> 00:47:34,965
Well, why didn't you ask
your dad how to build a tent?

543
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,135
I don't think he wants
to talk about this stuff.

544
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:41,096
Try him sometime, maybe
he'll surprise you.

545
00:47:41,131 --> 00:47:43,557
He's away alot, I
don't see him much.

546
00:47:43,592 --> 00:47:45,232
He's gotta be home sometime.

547
00:47:45,267 --> 00:47:49,569
I call, but Phyllis told
me I bug him too much.

548
00:47:49,604 --> 00:47:52,732
Phyllis? You call your own
mother by her first name?

549
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:56,486
- Phyllis isn't my mom.
- Oh!

550
00:48:05,787 --> 00:48:09,583
But he promised he'd come
to my Explorers Ceremony

551
00:48:09,618 --> 00:48:12,377
to pin on my "Assisting
the elderly badge".

552
00:48:12,836 --> 00:48:16,840
So he can show me how
about the tent then, right?

553
00:48:22,637 --> 00:48:26,148
Hey, why don't
you get some sleep?

554
00:48:26,183 --> 00:48:30,103
We don't want to wake the
travelling flea circus.

555
00:48:32,105 --> 00:48:35,233
Dle Fredricksen, Dug says he
wants to take Kevin prisoner.

556
00:48:35,275 --> 00:48:39,112
We have to protect him.

557
00:48:42,115 --> 00:48:44,763
Can Kevin go with us?

558
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:47,377
All right, he can come.

559
00:48:47,412 --> 00:48:49,748
Promise you won't leave him?

560
00:48:49,783 --> 00:48:50,922
Yeah.

561
00:48:50,957 --> 00:48:55,003
Cross your heart?

562
00:48:59,215 --> 00:49:03,595
Cross my heart.

563
00:49:08,475 --> 00:49:11,645
What have I got
myself into, Ellie?

564
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:35,669
Good morning, sweetheart.

565
00:49:37,087 --> 00:49:39,881
We'd better get moving.

566
00:49:42,175 --> 00:49:46,972
The bird's gone. Maybe
Russell won't notice.

567
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,098
All right, everybody up!

568
00:49:48,723 --> 00:49:50,850
Where's Kevin?
He's wondered off!

569
00:49:51,184 --> 00:49:53,186
- Dug, find Kevin! Kevin!
- Find the bird, find the bird!

570
00:49:53,353 --> 00:49:56,237
Point!

571
00:49:56,272 --> 00:49:58,233
Oh, look! There he is...

572
00:49:59,609 --> 00:50:01,743
Point!

573
00:50:01,778 --> 00:50:04,864
Hey, that's my roof!
Get off my roof!

574
00:50:04,899 --> 00:50:07,617
Yeah, get off of his WROOF!

575
00:50:11,996 --> 00:50:14,214
What is he doing?

576
00:50:14,249 --> 00:50:16,459
The bird is calling
to her babies.

577
00:50:16,494 --> 00:50:19,886
Her babies!

578
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:23,133
Kevin is a... girl?

579
00:50:24,259 --> 00:50:26,970
Her house is over there,
on those twisty rocks.

580
00:50:27,262 --> 00:50:31,433
She's been gathering food for her
babies and must get back to them.

581
00:50:31,468 --> 00:50:34,519
Wait, Kevin is just leaving.

582
00:50:36,229 --> 00:50:39,614
But you promised
to protect her.

583
00:50:39,649 --> 00:50:42,819
Her babies need her. We gotta
make sure they're together.

584
00:50:42,854 --> 00:50:45,864
Sorry, Russell. We've
lost enough time already.

585
00:50:46,906 --> 00:50:48,992
Yeah...

586
00:50:55,498 --> 00:50:58,967
It was her favorite chocolate.

587
00:50:59,002 --> 00:51:04,007
Because you sent her
away, there's more for you.

588
00:51:05,884 --> 00:51:08,803
Kevin?

589
00:51:26,863 --> 00:51:29,324
Where's the bird? You
said you had the bird!

590
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:31,510
Oh, yes, oh, yes.
If I had said that,

591
00:51:31,545 --> 00:51:33,661
I can see how you
would think that.

592
00:51:33,696 --> 00:51:34,787
Where is it?

593
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:42,045
Oh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow and
then I will again have the bird. Yes.

594
00:51:42,378 --> 00:51:46,173
You lost it. why do I not
have a surprised feeling?

595
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:50,028
Well, at least you now
have led us to the small

596
00:51:50,063 --> 00:51:53,848
mailman and to the one
that smells as prunes.

597
00:51:53,932 --> 00:51:56,726
The master will be most
pleased we have found them.

598
00:51:56,761 --> 00:51:58,394
He will ask them
many questions. Come.

599
00:51:58,429 --> 00:52:01,231
Wait! We're not
going with you.

600
00:52:01,266 --> 00:52:02,857
We're going to the fall.

601
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:07,111
Get away from me!

602
00:53:05,962 --> 00:53:07,213
Down!

603
00:53:15,638 --> 00:53:18,349
You came here... in that?

604
00:53:18,384 --> 00:53:19,767
Yeah.

605
00:53:20,643 --> 00:53:24,605
In a house? A floating house?

606
00:53:32,071 --> 00:53:35,950
That is the darnest
thing I've ever seen!

607
00:53:35,985 --> 00:53:38,960
You're not after
my bird, are you?

608
00:53:38,995 --> 00:53:43,374
But if you need to borrow a cup
of sugar, I'd be happy to oblige!

609
00:53:47,545 --> 00:53:50,047
Well, this is all
a misunderstanding.

610
00:53:50,082 --> 00:53:52,098
My dogs made a mistake.

611
00:53:52,133 --> 00:53:55,136
Wait. Are you Charles Muntz?

612
00:53:55,171 --> 00:53:58,062
Well... yes.

613
00:53:58,097 --> 00:54:00,203
The Charles Muntz?

614
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:02,310
Adventure's out there!

615
00:54:02,345 --> 00:54:04,068
It's really him!

616
00:54:04,103 --> 00:54:06,314
That's Charles Muntz!

617
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:07,447
It is?

618
00:54:07,482 --> 00:54:09,275
Who's Charles Muntz?

619
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:10,324
Him!

620
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:14,447
Carl Fredricksen. My wife and
I, we were your biggest fans.

621
00:54:14,482 --> 00:54:18,743
Oh, well, you're a
man of good taste.

622
00:54:18,993 --> 00:54:21,996
Now you must be tired. Hungry?

623
00:54:22,246 --> 00:54:25,958
Atention, everyone! These
people are no longer intruders.

624
00:54:25,993 --> 00:54:27,752
They are our guests.

625
00:54:27,787 --> 00:54:29,635
Yeah!

626
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:34,133
All right! I like
you temporarily.

627
00:54:34,926 --> 00:54:38,227
I will not bite you.

628
00:54:38,262 --> 00:54:41,182
The small mailman
smells like chocolate!

629
00:54:41,217 --> 00:54:43,524
I'm sorry about the dogs,

630
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:46,068
I hope they weren't
too... rough on you.

631
00:54:46,103 --> 00:54:51,359
Go ahead and pull your
airship right next to mine.

632
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,242
We are not actually going inside
the "Spirit of Adventure" itself?

633
00:54:59,277 --> 00:55:02,370
Oh, would you like to?

634
00:55:02,405 --> 00:55:04,956
Would I?

635
00:55:05,331 --> 00:55:07,937
Wait up, mr. Muntz!

636
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:10,509
Jiminy Cricket!

637
00:55:10,544 --> 00:55:12,678
- Not you!
- What do we do with Dug?

638
00:55:12,713 --> 00:55:16,259
He lost the bird. Put him
in "the cone of shame".

639
00:55:19,595 --> 00:55:23,975
I do not like "the
cone of shame".

640
00:55:25,434 --> 00:55:28,312
Most of the collection is housed
in the world's top museums:

641
00:55:28,347 --> 00:55:30,696
New York, Münich, London.

642
00:55:30,731 --> 00:55:33,359
Of course, I kept
the best for myself.

643
00:55:33,394 --> 00:55:36,150
Did you ever. Look at that!

644
00:55:36,185 --> 00:55:38,871
Oh, yes. The Arseloterium.

645
00:55:38,906 --> 00:55:41,742
The beast charged while
I was brushing my teeth.

646
00:55:41,777 --> 00:55:42,952
I used my shaving
kit to bring it down.

647
00:55:43,077 --> 00:55:46,587
Oh, yeah, now, surprise me.

648
00:55:46,622 --> 00:55:48,958
The only way to get it out
of Ethiopia at the time was

649
00:55:48,993 --> 00:55:51,252
to have it declared
technical weapon.

650
00:55:53,254 --> 00:55:55,923
Oh, my Gosh! The giant
Somalian Labradodis!

651
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:58,380
Oh, you recognize
it? I'm impressed!

652
00:55:58,415 --> 00:56:00,803
There's an interesting
story there.

653
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:03,135
Excellent choice.

654
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:05,433
I found it on safari,

655
00:56:05,468 --> 00:56:07,066
with Roosevelt.

656
00:56:07,101 --> 00:56:10,980
He and I fell into a habit of
playing Gin Rummy in the evenings

657
00:56:11,015 --> 00:56:13,249
and did he cheat!

658
00:56:13,284 --> 00:56:15,484
He was horrible.

659
00:56:17,862 --> 00:56:19,363
Master, dinner is ready.

660
00:56:19,398 --> 00:56:20,830
Oh, dear, broken translator.

661
00:56:20,865 --> 00:56:24,702
I think it's that
loose wire again.

662
00:56:24,827 --> 00:56:26,871
- There you go, big fellow.
- Thank you, master.

663
00:56:26,906 --> 00:56:30,249
I liked his other voice.

664
00:56:30,332 --> 00:56:32,418
Well, dinner is served.

665
00:56:32,453 --> 00:56:33,961
Right this way.

666
00:56:34,128 --> 00:56:37,972
So, how are
things States side?

667
00:56:38,007 --> 00:56:41,093
Almost tempted to
go back a few times.

668
00:56:41,886 --> 00:56:44,617
But I have
unfinished work here.

669
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:47,314
Please! I hope you're hungry.

670
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:51,854
Because Epsilon is the
finest chef I've ever had.

671
00:56:57,443 --> 00:56:59,653
Epsilon, you've done it again!

672
00:56:59,688 --> 00:57:00,696
Yeah!

673
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:04,331
Hey! Hey!

674
00:57:04,366 --> 00:57:07,953
My Ellie would have
loved all these.

675
00:57:07,995 --> 00:57:10,435
You know, because of
you she had this dream

676
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:13,069
to come down here
and live by the fall.

677
00:57:13,104 --> 00:57:15,634
I'm honored. And
now you've made it.

678
00:57:15,669 --> 00:57:18,422
You sure we're not a
bother? I'd hate to impose.

679
00:57:18,457 --> 00:57:20,758
No, no, it's a
pleasure to have guests.

680
00:57:20,793 --> 00:57:22,426
A real treat.

681
00:57:22,461 --> 00:57:23,684
Treat?

682
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:25,930
Where's my treat?
I want my treat!

683
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:28,606
Hey!

684
00:57:28,641 --> 00:57:30,100
I shouldn't have
used that word.

685
00:57:30,135 --> 00:57:32,443
Having guests is a delight!

686
00:57:32,478 --> 00:57:37,274
More often I get thieves trying
to steal what is rightfully mine.

687
00:57:37,309 --> 00:57:38,484
No...

688
00:57:40,819 --> 00:57:43,697
They called me
a fraud, those...

689
00:57:44,782 --> 00:57:49,161
But once I bring back this
creature, my name will be cleared.

690
00:57:49,203 --> 00:57:52,581
Beautiful, isn't it?

691
00:57:55,292 --> 00:57:57,628
Oh, I've spent a
lifetime tracking it.

692
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,299
Sometimes, years go by

693
00:58:02,334 --> 00:58:04,183
between seeings.

694
00:58:04,218 --> 00:58:09,265
I've tried to smoke it out of
that death land where it lives.

695
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,607
Can't go in after it.

696
00:58:11,642 --> 00:58:14,562
Once in, there's no way out.

697
00:58:14,597 --> 00:58:17,863
I lost so many dogs.

698
00:58:17,898 --> 00:58:23,779
Here they come tnose bandits who
think the bird is theirs to take!

699
00:58:27,658 --> 00:58:31,578
is a very dangerous place.

700
00:58:31,787 --> 00:58:36,548
Hey, that looks like Kevin!

701
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:39,586
- Kevin?
- Yeah, that's my new giant pet bird!

702
00:58:39,621 --> 00:58:41,505
I trained it to follow us.

703
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,847
Follow you?

704
00:58:43,882 --> 00:58:45,905
Impossible. How?

705
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,956
She likes chocolate.

706
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,937
- Chocolate?
- Yeah.

707
00:58:49,972 --> 00:58:51,348
I gave her some of my chocolate.
She goes wild about it.

708
00:58:51,383 --> 00:58:54,160
But it ran off.

709
00:58:54,195 --> 00:58:56,937
Let's go now.

710
00:58:59,857 --> 00:59:03,409
You know, Carl...

711
00:59:03,444 --> 00:59:07,031
these people who
pass through here

712
00:59:11,869 --> 00:59:14,538
A surveyor making a map...

713
00:59:14,955 --> 00:59:18,917
a botanist
cataloguing plants...

714
00:59:20,502 --> 00:59:26,717
an old man taking his
house to Paradise Falls.

715
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:37,853
That's the best one yet, I
can't wait to hear how it ends.

716
00:59:46,361 --> 00:59:50,407
Well, it's been a wonderful
evening, but we'd better be going.

717
00:59:50,442 --> 00:59:52,416
You're not leaving.

718
00:59:52,451 --> 00:59:55,913
We don't want to take
advantage of your hospitality.

719
00:59:55,948 --> 00:59:57,171
Come on, Russell.

720
00:59:57,206 --> 00:59:59,208
But we haven't even
had dessert yet.

721
00:59:59,243 --> 01:00:01,877
Oh, the boy is right.

722
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:04,110
You haven't had dessert.

723
01:00:04,145 --> 01:00:07,690
Epsilon here makes a
delicious cherries jubilee.

724
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:11,965
You really must
stay! I insist!

725
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,864
We have so much
more to talk about!

726
01:00:19,244 --> 01:00:20,495
Kevin?

727
01:00:27,377 --> 01:00:30,130
It's near.

728
01:00:30,922 --> 01:00:33,091
Get them!

729
01:00:34,759 --> 01:00:37,199
- Hurry!
- Kevin!

730
01:00:37,234 --> 01:00:39,639
Hurry! Dogs! Hurry!

731
01:00:40,473 --> 01:00:43,726
Master! Over here!

732
01:00:43,761 --> 01:00:47,313
Here!

733
01:00:59,576 --> 01:01:02,495
Go on, master!

734
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:26,311
Left!

735
01:01:31,441 --> 01:01:32,567
Russell!

736
01:01:37,947 --> 01:01:38,990
Get back!

737
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:45,622
Go on, master! I
will stop the dogs!

738
01:01:46,581 --> 01:01:48,541
Stop, you, dogs!

739
01:02:16,152 --> 01:02:19,364
Help!

740
01:02:26,412 --> 01:02:28,748
Give me your hand!

741
01:02:39,425 --> 01:02:44,097
Hang on to Kevin!

742
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:16,379
Kevin!

743
01:03:37,942 --> 01:03:40,236
No, no, no. Kevin...

744
01:03:40,361 --> 01:03:42,078
Stay down.

745
01:03:42,113 --> 01:03:44,740
She's hurt real bad.

746
01:03:44,782 --> 01:03:47,243
Can't we help her get home?

747
01:03:57,712 --> 01:04:01,424
All right. But we gotta hurry.

748
01:04:06,929 --> 01:04:09,564
- You lost them?
- No, it was Dug.

749
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:15,188
Yeah, he's with them.
he helped them escape!

750
01:04:15,223 --> 01:04:18,107
Wait. Wait a minute.

751
01:04:18,149 --> 01:04:19,275
Dug.

752
01:04:25,239 --> 01:04:28,492
- See anything?
- No, my pack is not following us.

753
01:04:28,527 --> 01:04:30,203
Boy, they are dumb!

754
01:04:30,238 --> 01:04:33,129
This is crazy.

755
01:04:33,164 --> 01:04:35,833
I finally meet my chidlhood
hero and he's trying to kill us.

756
01:04:35,868 --> 01:04:37,293
- What a joke.
- Hey, I know a joke!

757
01:04:37,501 --> 01:04:39,177
A squirrel walks up
up to a tree and says:

758
01:04:39,212 --> 01:04:42,840
"I forgot to store acorns
for winter and now I am dead".

759
01:04:43,216 --> 01:04:45,676
It is funny because
the squirrel gets dead.

760
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:49,326
Careful, Russell.

761
01:04:49,361 --> 01:04:51,933
You ok, Kevin?

762
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:59,197
You know what,
mr. Fredricksen?

763
01:04:59,232 --> 01:05:02,401
The wilderness isn't
quite what I expected.

764
01:05:02,436 --> 01:05:04,362
Yeah? How so?

765
01:05:04,528 --> 01:05:06,913
It's kind of... wild.

766
01:05:06,948 --> 01:05:10,159
I mean, it's not how they
made it sound in my book.

767
01:05:10,194 --> 01:05:12,460
Get used to that, kid.

768
01:05:12,495 --> 01:05:14,726
My dad made it sound so easy.

769
01:05:14,761 --> 01:05:16,923
He is really good at camping,

770
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:20,086
and how to make fire
from rocks and stuff...

771
01:05:20,121 --> 01:05:23,544
He used to come to all
my squad lodge meetings.

772
01:05:23,579 --> 01:05:26,795
And afterwards, we go
get icecream that fattens.

773
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:30,012
I always get chocolate
and he gets butter brickle.

774
01:05:30,047 --> 01:05:33,022
Then we sit on this
one curve, right outside

775
01:05:33,057 --> 01:05:36,769
and I'll count all the blue cars
and he counts all the red ones

776
01:05:36,804 --> 01:05:42,692
and whoever gets
the most wins.

777
01:05:43,776 --> 01:05:47,300
I like that curve.

778
01:05:47,335 --> 01:05:50,790
It might sound boring,

779
01:05:50,825 --> 01:05:54,829
but I think the boring stuff is
the stuff I remember the most.

780
01:06:02,545 --> 01:06:06,173
Look, there it is!

781
01:06:06,632 --> 01:06:09,719
Hold on, Russell, stand still.

782
01:06:19,228 --> 01:06:22,898
Look at that bird go! Wait
up, you overgrown chicken!

783
01:06:24,358 --> 01:06:27,319
That's it! Go, Kevin!
Go find your babies!

784
01:06:32,158 --> 01:06:35,286
Run, Kevin, run!

785
01:06:35,953 --> 01:06:38,205
Oh, no!

786
01:06:42,334 --> 01:06:46,088
Russell, dã-mi cuþitul tãu!

787
01:06:46,547 --> 01:06:49,508
Get away from my bird!

788
01:07:14,783 --> 01:07:16,869
No!

789
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:25,211
No!

790
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:34,470
Careful, I want it in good
shape for my retirement.

791
01:07:35,763 --> 01:07:37,932
Let it go!

792
01:07:37,973 --> 01:07:39,850
Stop!

793
01:07:43,187 --> 01:07:45,731
Kevin!

794
01:07:58,244 --> 01:08:01,705
You gave away Kevin.

795
01:08:01,747 --> 01:08:06,043
You just... gave her away.

796
01:08:06,085 --> 01:08:09,672
This is none of my concern.

797
01:08:09,707 --> 01:08:13,259
I didn't ask for any of these!

798
01:08:15,886 --> 01:08:18,659
Master, it's all right.

799
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:21,398
I am not your master!

800
01:08:21,433 --> 01:08:24,728
If you hadn't shown up, none
of these would have happened.

801
01:08:24,763 --> 01:08:27,481
Bad dog, bad dog!

802
01:08:35,739 --> 01:08:38,165
Whether you assist me or not,

803
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:41,787
I am going to Paradise
Falls, if it kills me!

804
01:09:54,318 --> 01:09:56,278
Here.

805
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,572
I don't want this anymore.

806
01:13:38,375 --> 01:13:41,586
Russell?

807
01:13:42,629 --> 01:13:47,050
- Russell!
- I'm gonna help Kevin

808
01:13:47,085 --> 01:13:49,945
even if you won't!

809
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:52,806
No, Russell, no!

810
01:15:05,128 --> 01:15:06,379
Russell?

811
01:15:09,883 --> 01:15:12,844
I was hiding under your
porch because I love you.

812
01:15:12,879 --> 01:15:14,477
Can I stay?

813
01:15:14,512 --> 01:15:16,765
Can you stay? Well,
you're my dog, aren't you?

814
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,367
And I'm your master.

815
01:15:18,402 --> 01:15:19,899
You're my master?

816
01:15:19,934 --> 01:15:22,687
- Oh, boy!
- Good boy, Dug!

817
01:15:22,722 --> 01:15:24,689
You're a good boy!

818
01:15:50,381 --> 01:15:51,424
Yes!

819
01:15:53,301 --> 01:15:55,470
Don't worry, Kevin,
I'll save you.

820
01:16:04,312 --> 01:16:06,362
And they wouldn't believe me.

821
01:16:06,397 --> 01:16:09,317
Just wait till they
get a look at you!

822
01:16:09,352 --> 01:16:10,200
Master.

823
01:16:10,235 --> 01:16:13,321
The small mailman
has returned.

824
01:16:13,356 --> 01:16:15,198
What?

825
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,950
Let me go!

826
01:16:16,991 --> 01:16:19,786
Where is your elderly friend?

827
01:16:19,869 --> 01:16:23,880
He's not my friend anymore.

828
01:16:23,915 --> 01:16:27,669
If you're here, Fredricksen
can't be far behind.

829
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:31,047
Where are you keeping Kevin?

830
01:16:31,172 --> 01:16:33,640
Let me go!

831
01:16:33,675 --> 01:16:35,892
Scream all you
want, small mailman.

832
01:16:35,927 --> 01:16:38,228
None of your mailmen
friends can hear you.

833
01:16:38,263 --> 01:16:44,269
I will unleash all my
wilderness explorer training!

834
01:16:45,186 --> 01:16:47,939
Alfa, Fredricksen
is coming back!

835
01:16:47,974 --> 01:16:50,281
Guard that bird.

836
01:16:50,316 --> 01:16:52,527
If you see the old man,
you know what to do.

837
01:16:52,569 --> 01:16:54,737
Where are you going? I'm
not finished with you!

838
01:16:54,772 --> 01:16:56,364
Nice talking with you.

839
01:17:01,995 --> 01:17:05,164
Where are you, Fredricksen?

840
01:17:19,304 --> 01:17:21,702
Help!

841
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:24,100
Russell!

842
01:17:36,654 --> 01:17:40,366
- Dle Fredricksen!
- Dug, bring her over!

843
01:17:40,450 --> 01:17:43,619
You came back for
Kevin! Let's go get her!

844
01:17:43,654 --> 01:17:45,837
I'm getting Kevin.
You stay here.

845
01:17:45,872 --> 01:17:49,375
- But I wanna help!
- I don't want your help.

846
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:52,295
I want you safe.

847
01:17:57,633 --> 01:17:59,427
How do we get pass these dogs?

848
01:17:59,462 --> 01:18:01,804
Point!

849
01:18:12,023 --> 01:18:13,066
Kevin!

850
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,492
Don't worry, Kevin.
We are on our way.

851
01:18:16,527 --> 01:18:20,073
No one should be enterring
through these doors.

852
01:18:20,108 --> 01:18:23,493
Guard well that
bird, my minions.

853
01:18:23,528 --> 01:18:26,913
What do we do now, Dug?

854
01:18:37,423 --> 01:18:40,927
Who wants the ball?

855
01:18:40,962 --> 01:18:43,096
Me, me, me!

856
01:18:46,307 --> 01:18:48,059
Go get it!

857
01:18:50,228 --> 01:18:54,649
I got it!

858
01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:01,280
I'm sorry, Kevin. Let's
get you out of here.

859
01:19:02,031 --> 01:19:03,741
- Master, he's gone.
- What's going on?

860
01:19:04,492 --> 01:19:06,244
- He's got the bird!
- He ran off!

861
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:08,204
Calm down! One at the time!

862
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:15,294
I want to... help!

863
01:19:28,766 --> 01:19:35,398
Does anybody know
where they are?

864
01:19:45,324 --> 01:19:50,413
Rais leaders! Bring
down that house!

865
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:57,593
Raid leader! Checking in!

866
01:19:57,628 --> 01:20:02,341
- Raid two, checking in.
- Raid three, checking in.

867
01:20:02,383 --> 01:20:05,761
Target sighted.

868
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:15,396
Come on, Kevin.

869
01:20:28,034 --> 01:20:32,121
Hi.

870
01:20:56,354 --> 01:21:00,024
Any last words, Fredricksen?

871
01:21:00,059 --> 01:21:02,610
Come on, spit it out!

872
01:21:02,645 --> 01:21:05,171
Come on!

873
01:21:05,206 --> 01:21:07,663
Enough!

874
01:21:07,698 --> 01:21:11,243
You cannot leave
this place alive!

875
01:21:11,278 --> 01:21:14,830
You're dead!

876
01:21:38,062 --> 01:21:41,565
Come on, Kevin.

877
01:21:59,583 --> 01:22:02,878
I'll have plenty of enjoyment
for what I'm about to do to you.

878
01:22:09,093 --> 01:22:12,555
He wears the cone of shame!

879
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:16,767
Not just continue
sitting! Atack!

880
01:22:19,728 --> 01:22:22,773
No! No! Stop your laughing!

881
01:22:22,808 --> 01:22:25,985
Listen, you, dog, sit!

882
01:22:26,026 --> 01:22:28,786
Yes, Alfa.

883
01:22:28,821 --> 01:22:33,033
Alfa? I am not
Alfa, he is... Oh!

884
01:22:33,075 --> 01:22:35,995
I can't do it.

885
01:22:37,913 --> 01:22:42,126
Russell...

886
01:22:43,335 --> 01:22:45,754
You leave mr.
Fredricksen alone!

887
01:23:02,771 --> 01:23:05,733
- Hey! Squirrel!
- Squrrel? Where?

888
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:16,702
I hate squirrels!

889
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:36,764
- Dug!
- Master!

890
01:23:36,972 --> 01:23:40,142
Russell, over here!

891
01:23:40,177 --> 01:23:43,520
Let's go!

892
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:49,589
Mr. Fredricksen!

893
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:52,988
Come on, Kevin.

894
01:24:04,375 --> 01:24:08,629
No!

895
01:24:20,391 --> 01:24:23,310
Russell, get out of there!

896
01:24:26,355 --> 01:24:29,066
Leave them alone!

897
01:24:42,871 --> 01:24:46,792
Russell, hang on to Kevin!
Don't let go! Grab on to him!

898
01:24:49,253 --> 01:24:52,423
Kevin! Cihcolate!

899
01:25:12,734 --> 01:25:16,488
That was cool!

900
01:25:17,197 --> 01:25:20,576
Don't jerk around
so much, kid.

901
01:25:20,617 --> 01:25:23,078
Easy, Russell.

902
01:25:24,037 --> 01:25:26,415
Oh, I am ready
to not be up high.

903
01:25:49,771 --> 01:25:52,649
Sorry about your
house, mr. Fredricksen.

904
01:25:54,359 --> 01:25:58,113
You know... It's just a house.

905
01:26:05,162 --> 01:26:08,290
Look at you! You're so soft!

906
01:26:11,543 --> 01:26:14,713
I wish I could keep one.

907
01:26:17,424 --> 01:26:20,469
Where is my cane?
I just had it here.

908
01:26:28,727 --> 01:26:31,939
You know what? Keep them. A
little gift from me to you.

909
01:26:31,974 --> 01:26:34,900
Bye, Kevin!

910
01:26:43,367 --> 01:26:46,536
- Ready?
- Ready.

911
01:26:57,798 --> 01:27:01,385
By receiving these badges,
the following explorers

912
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:04,471
will graduate to
Senior Explorers.

913
01:27:04,513 --> 01:27:06,848
For Extreme
Mountaineering Lore.

914
01:27:06,883 --> 01:27:08,148
Congratulations, Jimmy.

915
01:27:08,183 --> 01:27:11,269

Defensive Arts,

916
01:27:11,304 --> 01:27:13,831
Congratulations, Brendan.

917
01:27:13,866 --> 01:27:16,358
For Assisting the Elderly...

918
01:27:17,025 --> 01:27:20,278
Russell.
Is there someone...

919
01:27:22,489 --> 01:27:27,327
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Old man coming through.

920
01:27:27,369 --> 01:27:30,921
I'm here for him.

921
01:27:30,956 --> 01:27:34,751
Congratulations, Russell. Sir.

922
01:27:34,793 --> 01:27:38,512
Russell, for
assisting the elderly

923
01:27:38,547 --> 01:27:43,427
and for performing above
and beyond the call of duty,

924
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:49,224
I would like to award you the
highest honor I can bestow.

925
01:27:49,307 --> 01:27:53,937
<i><b>"The Ellie badge".</b></i>

926
01:28:01,945 --> 01:28:06,158
I think that covers everybody.
so let's give a big exlorer call

927
01:28:06,193 --> 01:28:09,536
to our brand new Senior
Wilderness Explorers!

928
01:28:09,571 --> 01:28:13,081
Ready everybody?

929
01:28:20,172 --> 01:28:23,571
- Blue one.
- Red one.

930
01:28:23,606 --> 01:28:26,970
- Blue one.
- Gray one.

931
01:28:27,471 --> 01:28:29,312
- Red one.
- That's a bike.

932
01:28:29,347 --> 01:28:33,643
- It's red, isn't it?
- Mr. Fredricksen, you're cheating!

933
01:28:33,685 --> 01:28:37,439
- No, I'm not. Red one.
- That's a fire hydrant.

934
01:28:37,474 --> 01:28:40,855
Maybe I need a few lessons.

935
