We will have singles auditions...

158
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:57,021
- You OK?
- Yeah.

159
00:09:57,095 --> 00:10:00,462
...and pairs auditions for our two leads.
- Pfft.

160
00:10:00,532 --> 00:10:05,492
Mr. Danforth, this is a place of learning,
not a hockey arena.

161
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,906
There is also a final sign-up for next week's
scholastic decathlon competition.

162
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:16,140
Chem Club president Taylor McHessey
can answer all of your questions about that.

163
00:10:16,214 --> 00:10:18,307
<i>(rings)</i>

164
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:22,080
Ah, the cell phone menace
has returned to our crucible of learning.

165
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:24,553
- Is it your phone?
- Sharpay and Ryan, cell phones.

166
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:27,523
- I will see you in detention.
- Ahh!

167
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:30,584
We have zero tolerance
for cell phones in class,

168
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:33,722
so we will get to know each other
in detention. Cell phone.

169
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:40,033
And welcome to East High, Miss Montez.
Mr. Bolton, I see your phone is involved.

170
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:44,768
- So we will see you in detention as well.
- That's not a possibility, Miss Darbus.

171
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:48,369
Your Honor, see, 'cause we have
basketball practice, and Troy...

172
00:10:48,446 --> 00:10:51,882
Ah, that will be 15 minutes
for you too, Mr. Danforth. Count 'em.

173
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,475
Could be tough for Chad.
He can't count that high.

174
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:56,952
- Taylor McHessey, 15 minutes.
<i>- (Taylor gasps)</i>

175
00:10:57,021 --> 00:11:00,548
Shall the carnage continue?
Holidays are over, people.

176
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:05,562
Way over!
Now, any more comments, questions?

177
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:10,595
- Jason.
- How were your holidays, Miss Darbus?

178
00:11:10,668 --> 00:11:11,896
What?

179
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,961
<i>(bell rings)</i>

180
00:11:19,844 --> 00:11:23,473
- Sorry, man. See you in detention.
- See you later. It's all good.

181
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:25,379
Uhh, she's crazy.

182
00:11:26,751 --> 00:11:28,048
Hey!

183
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:29,552
- I don't...
- Believe it.

184
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:31,851
- Well, me...
- Either. But how?

185
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:35,256
My mom's company transferred her
here to Albuquerque.

186
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:38,591
I can't believe you live here. I looked
for you at the lodge on New Year's Day.

187
00:11:38,663 --> 00:11:41,393
- We had to leave first thing.
- Why are you whispering?

188
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:45,493
What? Oh, uh... my friends
know about the snowboarding.

189
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,767
I haven't quite told them
about the singing thing.

190
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,102
- What's up?
- Hey.

191
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:53,075
- Too much for them to handle?
- No, it was cool.

192
00:11:53,144 --> 00:11:57,080
But, you know, my friends, it's, uh...
It's not what I do.

193
00:11:57,148 --> 00:12:01,175
That was, like, a different person.

194
00:12:02,987 --> 00:12:07,583
So, uh... anyway, welcome to East High.

195
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:11,288
Now that you've met Miss Darbus,
I bet you just can't wait to sign up for that.

196
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:15,492
I won't be signing up for anything for a
while. I just wanna get to know the school.

197
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:18,262
But if you sign up,
I'd consider coming to the show.

198
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:22,397
- Yeah, yeah. That's completely impossible.
- What's impossible, Troy?

199
00:12:22,473 --> 00:12:25,670
I wouldn't think "impossible"
is even in your vocabulary.

200
00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:29,474
Oh, so nice of you to
show our new classmate around.

201
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:41,122
Oh, were you going to sign up too?
My brother and I

202
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:44,923
have starred in all the school's productions
and we really welcome newcomers.

203
00:12:44,996 --> 00:12:49,057
There are a lot of supporting roles.
I'm sure we could find something for you.

204
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:52,261
No, no, no. I was just looking at
all the bulletin boards.

205
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:54,669
Lots going on at this school. Wow.

206
00:12:57,075 --> 00:13:00,010
Nice penmanship.

207
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:05,839
So, Troy. I missed you during vacation.
What'd you do?

208
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:10,718
You know, um... played basketball,
snowboarding, more basketball.

209
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:13,052
- When's the big game?
- Two weeks.

210
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:18,124
You are so dedicated.
Just like me.

211
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:20,960
I hope you come watch me in the musical.
Promise?

212
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:26,565
- Toodles!
- Toodles.

213
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:39,408
Dude, you know that school musical thing?
You get extra credit just for auditioning?

214
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:42,078
- Who cares?
- It's always good to get extra credit...

215
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:43,711
...for college...

216
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:47,246
Think LeBron James or Shaquille O'Neal
auditioned for their school musical?

217
00:13:47,325 --> 00:13:49,225
- Maybe.
- Troy.

218
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:55,323
The music in those shows isn't hip-hop,
or rock, or anything essential to culture.

219
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,895
It's, like, show music.
It's all costumes and makeup...

220
00:14:00,972 --> 00:14:05,136
- Oh, dude, it's frightening.
- I know. I thought it'd be a good laugh.

221
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:08,645
- Sharpay's kinda cute, too.
- So is a mountain lion.

222
00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:10,840
But you don't pet it.

223
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,047
All right, Wildcats! Pair up!

224

304
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,767
- Where did those come from?
- Didn't you put them in my locker?

305
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:36,773
- Of course not.
- Well, we'd love to have you on our team.

306
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:39,241
We meet almost every day after school.

307
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,800
Please?

308
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:44,712
I need to catch up on the curriculum here
before I think about joining any clubs.

309
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:49,116
Well, what a perfect way to get caught up.
Meeting with the smartest kids in school.

310
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:53,782
- What a generous offer, Taylor.
- So many new faces in detention today.

311
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:55,485
I hope you don't make a habit of it,

312
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:58,995
but the drama club can always use
an extra hand.

313
00:19:59,063 --> 00:20:05,798
And while we are working, let us probe
the mounting evils of cell phones.

314
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,235
<i>(whistle blows)</i>

315
00:20:07,304 --> 00:20:12,503
Come on, guys, huddle up!
We got two weeks to the big game.

316
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:14,771
Where's Troy and Chad?

317
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:20,216
Don't make me ask again.

318
00:20:20,284 --> 00:20:23,447
- Where's Troy and Chad?!
<i>- (all)</i> Detention.

319
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:26,012
<i>(sighs)</i>

320
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:29,384
<i>(whistle blows)</i>

321
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:35,057
Perhaps the most heinous example of
cell-phone abuse is ringing in the theater.

322
00:20:35,132 --> 00:20:39,125
What temerity!
The theater is a temple of art.

323
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:45,369
- A precious cornucopia of creative energy.
- Where's my team, Darbus?

324
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:47,410
What the heck are those two
doing in a tree?

325
00:20:47,478 --> 00:20:50,470
It's called crime and punishment, Bolton.

326
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:55,076
Besides, proximity to the arts
is cleansing for the soul.

327
00:20:55,152 --> 00:20:57,143
Can we have a talk, please?

328
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:59,451
And you two, in the gym, now!

329
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:11,267
If they have to paint sets for detention,
they could do it tonight, not during practice.

330
00:21:11,335 --> 00:21:15,362
If these were theater performers,
would you seek special treatment?

331
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:18,931
Darbus, we are days away
from our biggest game of the year.

332
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:23,503
And we, Bolton, are in the midst of our
auditions for our winter musicale as well!

333
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:27,847
This school is about more than
just young men in baggy shorts

334
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:30,182
flinging balls for touchdowns!

335
00:21:30,254 --> 00:21:32,779
Baskets! They shoot baskets.

336
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:36,418
Stop! Guys, listen,
you've been having this argument

337
00:21:36,493 --> 00:21:38,620
since the day you both started
teaching here.

338
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:40,994
We are one school, one student body,

339
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:44,034
one faculty!
Can we not agree on that?

340
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,134
So, Coach, how's the team lookin'?

341
00:21:48,205 --> 00:21:51,402
- Troy got 'em whipped into shape?
- Oh!

342
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,237
<i>(whistle blows)</i>

343
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:58,707
West High Knights have knocked us out
of the playoffs three years running,

344
00:21:58,782 --> 00:22:03,014
and now we are one game away from
taking that championship back from 'em!

345
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:06,622
It's time to make our stand.

346
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,022
The team is you.

347
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:13,587
You are the team.
And this team does not exist

348
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:19,603
unless each and every one of you
is fully focused on our goal. Am I clear?

349
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,331
- Hey, what team?!
- Wildcats!

350
00:22:21,405 --> 00:22:22,770
- What team?
- Wildcats!

351
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,171
- What team?
- Wildcats!

352
00:22:24,241 --> 00:22:26,232
- Wildcats!
- Get your head in the game!

353
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:29,106
We've never made it past the first round

354
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:32,012
of the scholastic decathlon.
You could be our answered prayer.

355
00:22:32,082 --> 00:22:34,016
I'm focusing on my studies this semester,

356
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:37,178
and help my mom get the new house
organized. Maybe next year.

357
00:22:37,254 --> 00:22:41,782
- What do you know about Troy Bolton?
- Troy? Hmm.

358
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:44,453
I'm not an expert
on that particular sub-species,

359
00:22:44,528 --> 00:22:46,553
however, unless you speak cheerleader,

360
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:51,727
as in, "Oh, my gosh! Isn't Troy Bolton
just the hottie super-bum?"

361
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:55,397
Oh, he's so beautiful.

362
00:22:55,472 --> 00:22:59,465
- Ha-ha. See what I mean?
- I don't know how to speak cheerleader.

363
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:02,808
We exist in an alternate
universe to Troy the basketball boy.

364
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,279
Have you tried to get to know him?

365
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:07,181
Watch how it works tomorrow
when you have lunch with us.

366
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:10,778
Unless you'd rather sit with the
cheerleaders and discuss firm nail beds.

367
00:23:10,854 --> 00:23:13,084
My nail beds are history.

368
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:15,853
Sister!

369
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:22,160
- Still don't understand this detention thing.
- It was my fault.

370
00:23:22,232 --> 00:23:23,995
- Sorry, Dad.
- Cross court.

371
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:29,233
Darbus will take any opportunity to
bust my chops. That includes yours too.

372
00:23:29,306 --> 00:23:30,796
Hey, Dad?

373
00:23:30,874 --> 00:23:35,573
Did you ever want to try something new,
but were afraid of what your friends think?

374
00:23:35,646 --> 00:23:37,477
Like, going left? You're doing fine.

375
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,544
Well... no.

376
00:23:40,617 --> 00:23:43,051
I mean, what if you wanna
try something really new

377
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,113
and it's a total disaster
and all your friends laugh at you.

378
00:23:47,191 --> 00:23:51,218
Maybe they're not your friends.
That was my whole point about team today.

379
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:53,661
You gotta look out for each other.
You're the leader.

380
00:23:53,731 --> 00:23:56,199
There's gonna be college scouts
at our game next week.

381
00:23:56,266 --> 00:23:58,632
Know what a scholarship
is worth these days?

382
00:23:58,702 --> 00:24:01,432
- A lot.
- Yeah. Focus, Troy, come on.

383
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:06,102
Whoo.

384
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:19,178
Just something for you.

385
00:24:23,927 --> 00:24:25,326
<i>(bell ringing)</i>

386
00:24:25,396 --> 00:24:30,390
I expect we all learned our homeroom
manners yesterday, people, correct?

387
00:24:30,467 --> 00:24:33,868
If not, we have some dressing rooms
that need painting.

388
00:24:33,937 --> 00:24:37,168
Now, a few announcements.

389
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:42,144
This morning during free period will be
your chance for the musicale auditions,

390
00:24:42,212 --> 00:24:44,680
both single and pairs.

391
00:24:44,748 --> 00:24:49,811
I will be in the theater until noon
for those of you bold enough to extend

392
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:52,879
the wingspan of your creative spirit.

393
00:24:52,956 --> 00:24:55,322
When's she due back on the mother ship?

394
00:24:55,392 --> 00:24:57,690
Discussing the importance
of Shakespeare...

395
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:00,894
- What's up, man?
- What's up?

396
00:25:00,964 --> 00:25:04,058
The team's hitting the gym during
free period. What should we run?

397
00:25:04,134 --> 00:25:07,535
I can't make it.
I gotta catch up on some homework.

398
00:25:07,604 --> 00:25:11,472
What? Hello, it's only the second day back.
I'm not even behind on homework yet.

399
00:25:11,542 --> 00:25:14,340
And I've been behind on homework
since preschool.

400
00:25:14,411 --> 00:25:17,471
That's hilarious.
I'll catch you later.

401
00:25:19,283 --> 00:25:21,649
Homework? There's no way.

402
00:25:26,156 --> 00:25:28,124
- How's it going?
<i>- (Troy)</i> Just hanging out?

403
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:31,218
- Good to see you.
- What's he doing?

404
00:25:32,863 --> 00:25:34,854
How's it going, man?

405
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,431
Short-cut.

406
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,376
I'm late for class.

407
00:26:38,695 --> 00:26:40,686
<i>(boy)</i> That's good, just leave it here.

408

<i>(overlapping chatter)</i>

409
00:27:03,854 --> 00:27:08,382
This is where the true expression
of the artist is realized.

410
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:11,450
Where inner truth is revealed
through the actor's journey...

411
00:27:11,528 --> 00:27:12,859
<i>(bell ringing)</i>

412
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,728

- Is it mine?

413
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:18,393
- No, ma'am. That was the warning bell.
- Ah!

414
00:27:18,468 --> 00:27:21,995
Those wishing to audition must
understand that time is of the essence.

415
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:26,304
We have many roles to cast
and final callbacks will be next week.

416
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:29,903
First, you will sing a few bars and I will
give you a sense of whether or not

417
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:35,976
the theater is your calling. Better to hear it
from me now than from your friends later.

418
00:27:36,053 --> 00:27:38,783
Our composer, Kelsi Nielson,
will accompany you

419
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:42,586
and be available for rehearsals
prior to callbacks.

420
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:43,683

not been accessed in the natural world.

Bravo! Brava!

00:29:11,615 --> 00:29:15,984

00:30:07,037 --> 00:30:09,369
So you decided to sign up for something?

456
00:30:09,439 --> 00:30:13,341
- Uh... No. You?
- No.

457
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:18,177
Um... why are you hiding behind a mop?

458
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:20,682
Your friends don't know you're here, right?

459
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:23,584
Right.

460
00:30:23,653 --> 00:30:27,680
<i>(</i># <i>plays intro)</i>

461
00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:29,555
Thank you. Next.

462
00:30:31,461 --> 00:30:35,625
Miss Darbus is a little... harsh.

463
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:40,898
- The Wildcat superstar's afraid?
- No! I'm not afraid, I...

464
00:30:40,971 --> 00:30:45,874
- I'm just... scared.
- Me too... usually.

465
00:30:45,942 --> 00:30:51,903
And for the lead roles of Minnie and Arnold
we only have one couple signed up.

466
00:30:51,982 --> 00:30:55,941
Sharpay and Ryan,
I think it might be useful for you

467
00:30:56,019 --> 00:31:01,218
to give us a sense of why
we gather in this hallowed hall.

468
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:09,091
What key?

469
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:12,431
Oh, we had our rehearsal pianist
do an arrangement.

470
00:31:12,502 --> 00:31:14,231
Oh.

471

I told you not to do the jazz squares.

503
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:27,862
It's a crowd favorite.
Everybody loves a good jazz square.

<i>(applause)</i>

505
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:33,400
Well...

506
00:33:33,476 --> 00:33:36,673
Are there any last-minute sign-ups?

507
00:33:36,746 --> 00:33:41,445
Don't be discouraged. The theater club
needs more than singers. It needs fans too.

508
00:33:41,518 --> 00:33:43,577
Buy tickets!

509
00:33:43,653 --> 00:33:45,348
Oh, actually,

510
00:33:45,422 --> 00:33:49,358
if you do the part with that particular
song, I imagined it much slow...

511
00:33:49,426 --> 00:33:52,452
If we do the part?

512
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:59,458
Kelsi, my sawed-off Sondheim,
I've been in 17 school productions.

513
00:33:59,536 --> 00:34:01,902
How many of your
compositions have been selected?

514
00:34:01,972 --> 00:34:05,806
- This would be the first.
- Which tells us what?

515
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:10,039
- That I need to write you more solos?
- No. It tells us that you do not offer

516
00:34:10,113 --> 00:34:13,378
direction, suggestion or commentary.
And you should be thankful

517
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,317
that me and Ryan can lift
your music out of its obscurity.

518
00:34:16,386 --> 00:34:18,616
- Are we clear?
- Yes, ma'am. I mean, Sharpay.

519
00:34:21,157 --> 00:34:23,591
Nice talking to you.

520
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,719
Any last-minute sign-ups?

521
00:34:26,963 --> 00:34:31,195
- We should go.
- No? Good. Done.

522
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,697
I'd like to audition, Miss Darbus.

523
00:34:37,774 --> 00:34:41,210
Timeliness means something in the world
of theater, young lady.

524
00:34:41,277 --> 00:34:46,613
The individual auditions are long over
and there are simply no other pairs.

525
00:34:46,683 --> 00:34:48,344
I'll sing with her.

526
00:34:51,721 --> 00:34:57,591
Troy Bolton? Where is your sports posse
or whatever it's called?

527
00:34:57,661 --> 00:35:00,152
- Team.
- Ah.

528
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:03,688
But I'm here alone.
Actually, I'm here to sing with her.

529
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:09,103
Yes, well, we take these shows very
seriously here at East High.

530
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:12,164
I called for the pairs audition,
and you didn't respond.

531
00:35:12,242 --> 00:35:14,506
Free period is now over.

532
00:35:14,577 --> 00:35:20,573
- She has an amazing voice.
- Perhaps the next musicale.

533
00:35:34,464 --> 00:35:36,955
So, you're a composer?

534
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:40,298
You wrote the song
Ryan and Sharpay just sang?

535
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,702
And the entire show?

536
00:35:42,772 --> 00:35:44,296
Well, that's really cool.

537
00:35:44,374 --> 00:35:48,174
I can't wait to hear the rest of the show.

538
00:35:49,446 --> 00:35:52,347
So, why are you so afraid of
Ryan and Sharpay?

539
00:35:52,415 --> 00:35:54,542
- I mean, it is your show.
- It is?

540
00:35:54,617 --> 00:35:58,314
Isn't the composer of a show kind of
like the playmaker in basketball?

541
00:35:58,388 --> 00:35:59,946
Playmaker?

542
00:36:00,023 --> 00:36:02,218
The one who makes everyone else
look good.

543
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:05,659
Without you there is no show.
You're the playmaker here, Kelsi.

544
00:36:05,729 --> 00:36:07,697
I am?

545
00:36:07,764 --> 00:36:10,824
Do you wanna hear how the duet's
supposed to sound?

546
00:36:26,716 --> 00:36:31,585
# It's hard to believe that I couldn't see

547
00:36:31,654 --> 00:36:35,283
# You were always there beside me

548
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:40,694
# Thought I was alone with no one to hold

549
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:43,892

# I want you to know

552
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:57,780
# That I've never had someone
that knows me like you do

553
00:36:57,847 --> 00:37:00,407
# The way you do

554
00:37:00,483 --> 00:37:06,422
# And I've never had someone
as good for me as you

555
00:37:06,489 --> 00:37:09,856

# So lonely before I finally found

557
00:37:15,598 --> 00:37:20,297
# What I've been looking for

558
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:26,272
# Ooh-ooh-ooh

559
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:35,278
Wow. That's nice.

560
00:37:35,351 --> 00:37:37,649
Bolton, Montez - you have a callback.

561
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,247
Kelsi, give them the duet
from the second act.

562
00:37:41,324 --> 00:37:43,417
- Work on it with them.
- All right.

563
00:37:43,493 --> 00:37:47,429
If you guys wanna rehearse, I'm usually
here during free period and after school,

564
00:37:47,497 --> 00:37:51,661
and even sometimes during biology class.
You can come and rehearse anytime.

565
00:37:51,734 --> 00:37:55,465
Or come to my house for breakfast.
I have a piano, we can rehearse there.

566
00:37:55,538 --> 00:37:58,735
After school, before school - whatever
works. After basketball class...

567
00:37:59,776 --> 00:38:00,765
What?

568
00:38:00,844 --> 00:38:04,871
<i>(Sharpay)</i> Callback?! Aah!

569
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:10,141
"Callback for roles Arnold and Minnie
next Thursday, 3:30pm.

570

Ryan and Sharpay Evans,
Gabriella Montez and Troy Bolton."

571
00:38:15,258 --> 00:38:18,227
Is this some kind of joke?
They didn't even audition!

572
00:38:18,294 --> 00:38:20,125
- Maybe we're being punked?
- What?

573
00:38:20,196 --> 00:38:23,654
Maybe we're being filmed right now.
Maybe we'll get to meet Ashton!

574
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:25,860
Oh, shut up, Ryan!

575
00:38:25,935 --> 00:38:28,904
What's wrong?

576
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,508
<i>(Chad)</i> What?

577
00:38:36,045 --> 00:38:37,603
Uhh!

578
00:38:42,285 --> 00:38:45,482
How dare she sign up! I picked out
the colors for my dressing room.

579
00:38:45,555 --> 00:38:48,581
She hasn't even asked our permission
to join the drama club.

580
00:38:49,792 --> 00:38:52,784
- Someone's gotta tell her the rules.
- Exactly.

581
00:38:53,997 --> 00:38:56,989
- And what are the rules?
- Ohh!

582
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:16,878
# You can bet there's nothin' but net
when I am in a zone and on a roll

583
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:19,649
# But I got a confession,
my own secret obsession

584
00:39:19,722 --> 00:39:23,021
# And it's making me lose control

585
00:39:23,092 --> 00:39:26,858
# Everybody gather 'round

586
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:29,228
If Troy can tell his
secret, then I can tell mine.

587
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:31,358
- I bake.
- What?

588
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:34,733
I love to bake! Strudels, scones,
even apple pandowdy.

589
00:39:34,804 --> 00:39:36,795
# Not another sound

590
00:39:36,873 --> 00:39:39,933
Someday I hope to make
the perfect crème brûlée.

591
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:43,968
# No, no, no, no!
No, no, no

592
00:39:44,047 --> 00:39:46,607
# Stick to the stuff you know

593
00:39:46,683 --> 00:39:49,914
# If you wanna be cool
follow one simple rule

594
00:39:49,986 --> 00:39:53,080
# Don't mess with the flow
no, no

595
00:39:53,156 --> 00:39:56,284
# Stick to the status quo

596
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:01,558
# Look at me and what do you see?
Intelligence beyond compare

597
00:40:01,631 --> 00:40:04,759
# But inside I am stirring,
something strange is occurring

598
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:07,496
# It's a secret I need to share

599
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:11,529
# Open up, dig way down deep

600
00:40:11,607 --> 00:40:17,068
Hip-hop is my passion.
I love to pop and lock and jam and break!

601
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:18,340
Is that even legal?

602
00:40:18,414 --> 00:40:20,279
# Not another peep!

603
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,114
It's just dancing.
I think it's cooler than homework.

604
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:27,589
# No, no, no, no!
No, no, no

605
00:40:27,657 --> 00:40:30,455
# Stick to the stuff you know

606
00:40:30,526 --> 00:40:33,290
# It is better by far
to keep things as they are

607
00:40:33,363 --> 00:40:36,355
# Don't mess with the flow,

00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:44,839
# Listen well, I'm ready to tell
about a need that I cannot deny

610
00:40:44,907 --> 00:40:48,172
# Dude, there's no explanation
for this awesome sensation

611
00:40:48,244 --> 00:40:51,509
# But I'm ready to let it fly

612

# Speak your mind and you'll be heard

613
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:56,950
If Troy wants to be a singer,
then I'm coming clean.

614
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,456
- I play the cello!
- Awesome! What is it?

615
00:41:00,923 --> 00:41:03,949
- A saw!
- No, dude, it's like, a giant violin!

616
00:41:04,027 --> 00:41:05,790
# Not another word

617
00:41:05,862 --> 00:41:08,695
- Do you have to wear a costume?
- Coat and tie.

618
00:41:08,765 --> 00:41:12,565
# No, no, no, no!
No, no, no

# Everybody quiet!

644
00:42:48,998 --> 00:42:50,761
Why is everybody staring at you?

645
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:53,427
- Not me, you.
- Because of the callbacks?

646
00:42:53,503 --> 00:42:55,733
I can't have people staring at me.
I can't.

00:42:55,805 --> 00:42:57,932

660
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,701
I am so sorry.

661
00:43:38,714 --> 00:43:40,409
You do not want to get into that, man.

662
00:43:40,483 --> 00:43:42,144
- Too much drama.
- Yeah.

663
00:43:42,218 --> 00:43:44,686
What is going on here?

664
00:43:44,754 --> 00:43:48,053
Look at this! That Gabriella girl
just dumped her lunch on me!

665
00:43:48,124 --> 00:43:51,560
On purpose! It's all part of their plan to
ruin our musical.

666
00:43:51,627 --> 00:43:55,119
And Troy and his basketball robots
are obviously behind it.

667
00:43:55,198 --> 00:43:56,961
Why do you think he auditioned?

668
00:43:57,033 --> 00:44:00,992
After all the hard work you've
put into this show.

669
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:03,436
It just doesn't seem right.

670
00:44:06,876 --> 00:44:10,607
- What's up?
- What's up? Oh, let's see...

671
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,979
You missed free-period workout
to audition for a heinous musical.

672
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,518
And now suddenly people are confessing.

673
00:44:17,153 --> 00:44:21,055
Yeah, and Zeke.
Zeke is baking... crème brûlée.

674
00:44:21,123 --> 00:44:22,112
What's that?

675
00:44:22,191 --> 00:44:24,557
Oh, a creamy custard
with a caramelized surface.

676
00:44:24,627 --> 00:44:28,393
- It's really satisfying.
- Shut up, Zeke!

677
00:44:28,464 --> 00:44:31,900
Look... do you see
what's happening here, man?

678
00:44:31,968 --> 00:44:35,028
Our team is coming apart
because of your singing thing.

679
00:44:35,104 --> 00:44:38,733
Even the drama geeks and
the brainiacs suddenly think that they can...

680
00:44:38,808 --> 00:44:39,866
...talk to us.

681
00:44:39,942 --> 00:44:42,672
- Look, the skater dudes are mingling.
- Yo!

682
00:44:42,745 --> 00:44:45,475
Suddenly people think that they
can do other stuff.

683
00:44:45,548 --> 00:44:47,914
Stuff that's not their stuff.

684
00:44:47,984 --> 00:44:54,219
You're thinking about show tunes,
when we've got a playoff game next week.

685
00:45:02,098 --> 00:45:03,087
Whoa!

686
00:45:03,165 --> 00:45:04,632
Whoa!

687
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,362
- Ooh!
<i>- (boy)</i> Head's up!

688
00:45:19,315 --> 00:45:23,615
- All right. Cards on the table right now.
- Huh?

689
00:45:23,686 --> 00:45:27,622
You're tweaked because I put your stars
in detention and now you're getting even.

690
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:29,385
What are you talking about, Darbus?

691
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:32,086
Your all-star son
turned up at my audition.

692
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:34,925
Now, I give every student an even chance,

693
00:45:34,997 --> 00:45:38,228
which is a long and honorable
tradition in the theater.

694
00:45:38,301 --> 00:45:40,963
Something that you wouldn't understand.

695
00:45:41,037 --> 00:45:46,566
But, if he is planning some sort of practical
joke in my chapel of the arts...

696
00:45:46,642 --> 00:45:50,134
- Troy doesn't even sing.
- Oh, well, you're wrong about that.

697
00:45:50,212 --> 00:45:56,082
But I will not allow my <i>Twinkle Town</i>
musicale to be made into farce.

698
00:45:56,152 --> 00:46:00,282
<i>- Twinkle Town</i>?
- See? I knew it!

699
00:46:00,356 --> 00:46:03,917
- Hey...
- I knew it!

700
00:46:03,993 --> 00:46:07,121
Sounds like a winner.
Good luck on Broadway!

701
00:46:09,565 --> 00:46:12,659
Is Sharpay really, really mad at me?
I said I was sorry.

702
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:16,296
Look, no one has beaten out Sharpay for
a musical since kindergarten.

703
00:46:16,372 --> 00:46:18,363
I wasn't trying to beat anyone out.

704
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:20,773
We didn't even audition,
we were just singing.

705
00:46:20,843 --> 00:46:23,038
You won't convince Sharpay of that.

706
00:46:23,112 --> 00:46:27,378
If that girl could play both Romeo and
Juliet, her own brother would be aced out.

707
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:31,853
I told you it just happened, but I liked it.

708
00:46:31,921 --> 00:46:33,821
A lot.

709
00:46:33,889 --> 00:46:36,881
Did you ever feel like there's
a whole other person inside you

710
00:46:36,959 --> 00:46:40,554
just looking for a way to come out?

711
00:46:40,629 --> 00:46:44,121
Not really. No.

712
00:46:45,201 --> 00:46:46,566
<i>(bell ringing)</i>

713
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:48,068
Let's go.

714
00:46:50,373 --> 00:46:53,774
Hey, Sharpay, I thought since Troy Bolton's
gonna be in your show...

715
00:46:53,843 --> 00:46:56,243
Troy Bolton is not in my show.

716
00:46:56,312 --> 00:47:00,373
OK, um... well, I thought maybe
you could watch me play ball sometime.

717
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:06,351
- I'd rather stick pins in my eyes.
- Wouldn't that be awfully uncomfortable?

718
00:47:06,422 --> 00:47:08,185
Evaporate, tall person!

719
00:47:10,192 --> 00:47:12,251
I bake!

720
00:47:12,328 --> 00:47:15,161
If that helps.

721
00:47:38,187 --> 00:47:44,353
- Wow! It's like a jungle up here.
- Yeah, just like that cafeteria.

722
00:47:44,427 --> 00:47:47,225
Well, I just humiliated myself into
the next century.

723
00:47:47,296 --> 00:47:50,390
- No! Come on.
- So this is your private hideout?

724
00:47:50,466 --> 00:47:55,028
Yeah. Thanks to the science club. Which
means my buddies don't know it exists.

725
00:47:55,104 --> 00:47:58,073
You pretty much have the school wired,
don't you, Troy?

726
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:01,576
Seems to me like everyone on campus
wants to be your friend.

727
00:48:01,644 --> 00:48:03,942
Unless we lose.

728
00:48:04,013 --> 00:48:06,379
Well, I'm sure it's tricky
being the coach's son.

729
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:10,249
Makes me practice a little harder,
I guess.

730
00:48:11,153 --> 00:48:13,417
I don't know what he'll say
about the singing.

731
00:48:13,489 --> 00:48:17,585
- You worried?
- My parents friends are always saying,

732
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:24,759
"Your son's the basketball guy.
You must be so proud."

733
00:48:27,002 --> 00:48:30,768
Sometimes I don't wanna be
the "basketball guy."

734
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,274
I just wanna be a guy. You know?

735
00:48:34,143 --> 00:48:37,704
I saw the way you treated Kelsi at
the audition yesterday.

736
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:40,510
Do your friends know that guy?

737
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:43,552
To them, I'm the playmaker dude.

738
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:45,519
They don't know enough
about you, Troy.

739
00:48:45,588 --> 00:48:49,251
At my other schools I was
the freaky math girl.

740
00:48:49,325 --> 00:48:54,126
It's cool coming here and being...
anyone I wanna be.

741
00:48:54,196 --> 00:48:57,757
When I was singing with you
I just felt like... a girl.

742
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:00,165
You even look like one, too.

743
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:08,976
Remember in kindergarten how you'd meet
a kid and know nothing about them,

744
00:49:09,044 --> 00:49:11,638
then ten seconds later you play
like you're best friends

745
00:49:11,714 --> 00:49:14,615
because you didn't have to
be anything but yourself.

746
00:49:14,683 --> 00:49:17,151
- Yeah.
- Singing with you felt like that.

747
00:49:18,888 --> 00:49:24,121
Well, uh... I never thought about singing.
That's for sure.

748
00:49:24,193 --> 00:49:26,252
Till you.

749
00:49:26,328 --> 00:49:30,059
So you really wanna do the callbacks?

750
00:49:30,132 --> 00:49:33,329
Hey, just call me freaky callback boy.

751
00:49:35,437 --> 00:49:37,564
You're a cool guy, Troy.

752
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,837
But not for the reasons your friends think.

753
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,346
And thanks for showing me
your top-secret hiding place.

754
00:49:44,413 --> 00:49:46,813
Like kindergarten.

00:51:17,306 --> 00:51:19,706
# Flyin'

763
00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:24,007
# There's not a star in heaven that we...

764
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:25,068
<i>(whistle blows)</i>

765
00:51:25,147 --> 00:51:29,277
Let's go, guys! Make it sharp!
To the chest, come on! Pop it!

766
00:51:29,351 --> 00:51:31,945
Come on, guys. Step with it!
Let's go!

767
00:51:32,021 --> 00:51:34,421
Come on, move it! Let's go!

768
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:37,789
Come on, guys, focus! Focus!
Get your head in the game!

769
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,327
Move it!

770
00:51:40,262 --> 00:51:44,096
- You seen Troy?
- No... Coach.

771
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:45,929
<i>(blows whistle)</i> Again, let's go!

772
00:52:08,557 --> 00:52:09,546
<i>(whistle blows)</i>

773
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:14,062
That's it, guys. Let's hit the showers.
Good hustle. Let's see that in the game.

774
00:52:18,033 --> 00:52:21,969
I, uh... think I'm gonna stay a while.
Work on some free throws.

775
00:52:22,037 --> 00:52:26,736
Since you missed practice, I think your
team deserves a little effort from you today.

776
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:39,946
Wow. So this is your real stage.

777
00:52:40,022 --> 00:52:42,388
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.

778
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:44,688
Or just a smelly gym.

779
00:52:47,763 --> 00:52:49,162
Whoa!

780
00:52:49,231 --> 00:52:51,461
Don't tell me you're good at hoops, too.

781
00:52:51,533 --> 00:52:54,661
You know, I once scored 41 points
at a league championship game.

782
00:52:54,737 --> 00:52:56,864
- No way.
- Mm-hm. And the same day,

783
00:52:56,939 --> 00:52:59,373
I invented the space shuttle
and microwave popcorn.

784
00:52:59,441 --> 00:53:02,706
Oh! Microwave popcorn. Ha-ha. Funny.

785
00:53:06,315 --> 00:53:11,184
- I've been rehearsing with Kelsi.
- Me, too. And, by the way,

786
00:53:11,253 --> 00:53:15,019
I missed practice. So if I get kicked off
the team it'll be on your conscience.

787
00:53:15,724 --> 00:53:18,955
- Hey, I wasn't the one who told you...
- Gabriella, chill.

788
00:53:20,763 --> 00:53:23,664
Hey, that's traveling.
No, that's really bad traveling.

789
00:53:23,732 --> 00:53:24,926
<i>(laughing)</i>

790
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,494
Miss! I'm sorry, this is a closed practice.

791
00:53:29,571 --> 00:53:32,472
- Dad, practice is over.
- Not till the last player leaves.

792
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:34,839
- Team rule.
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

793
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:39,244
- Dad, this is Gabriella Montez.
- Ah, your detention buddy.

794
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:43,945
I'll see you later, Troy.

795
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:46,180
Nice meeting you, Coach Bolton.

796
00:53:47,689 --> 00:53:49,384
You as well, Miss Montez.

797
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,392
Dad, detention was my fault,
not hers.

798
00:53:54,463 --> 00:53:58,263
You haven't missed practice in three years.
That girl shows up...

799
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:02,133
That girl is named Gabriella.
She's very nice.

800
00:54:02,204 --> 00:54:05,435
Helping you miss practice doesn't
make her very nice. Not in my book.

801
00:54:05,507 --> 00:54:07,532
- Or your team's.
- Dad, she's not a problem.

802
00:54:07,609 --> 00:54:12,103
- She's just a girl.
- But you're not just a guy, Troy.

803
00:54:12,181 --> 00:54:14,581
You're the team leader.

804
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:18,313
What you do effects not only this team,
but the entire school.

805
00:54:18,387 --> 00:54:23,757
And without you completely focused,
we're not gonna win next week.

806
00:54:23,826 --> 00:54:27,262
The championship games -
they don't come along all the time.

807
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:32,266
- They're something special.
- Yeah, a lot of things are special, Dad.

808
00:54:32,334 --> 00:54:36,771
But you're a playmaker...
not a singer, right?

809
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:40,866
Did you ever think maybe I could be both?

810
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:53,950
- What?
- Let's go.

811
00:54:55,557 --> 00:54:59,186
What spell has this elevated-IQ
temptress girl cast

812
00:54:59,261 --> 00:55:01,456
that suddenly makes you wanna be
in musical?

813
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:03,464
Look, I just did it. Who cares?

814
00:55:03,532 --> 00:55:07,127
Who cares? How about your most
loyal best friend?

815
00:55:07,202 --> 00:55:11,036
- Quiet in here, Mr. Danforth.
- It's him, Miss Falsaff, not me.

816
00:55:11,106 --> 00:55:16,772
Look, you're a hoops dude,
not a musical singer person.

817
00:55:16,845 --> 00:55:19,075
Have you seen Michael Crawford
on a cereal box?

818
00:55:19,147 --> 00:55:22,810
- Who's Michael Crawford?
- Exactly my point.

819
00:55:22,885 --> 00:55:25,547
He was the Phantom of the Opera
on Broadway.

820
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:29,216
Now my mom, she's seen
that musical 27 times,

821
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:31,953
and put Michael Crawford's picture
in our refrigerator.

822
00:55:32,027 --> 00:55:34,621
Yeah, not on it, in it.

823
00:55:34,696 --> 00:55:38,996
So my point is, if you play basketball,
you're gonna end up on the cereal box.

824
00:55:39,067 --> 00:55:42,036
If you're in musicals, you'll
end up in my mom's refrigerator.

825
00:55:42,104 --> 00:55:43,799
Why in her refrigerator?

826
00:55:43,872 --> 00:55:49,037
One of her crazy diet ideas. I won't
attempt to understand the female mind.

827
00:55:49,111 --> 00:55:51,375
It's foreign territory.

828
00:55:54,917 --> 00:56:00,014
How can you expect the rest of us to be
focused on a game if you're off somewhere

829
00:56:00,088 --> 00:56:01,885
in leotards singing "Twinkle Town"?

830
00:56:01,957 --> 00:56:03,982
No one said anything about leotards.

831
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:06,289
Not yet, my friend, but just you wait.

832
00:56:06,361 --> 00:56:09,057
Look, we need you, Captain.
Big time.

833
00:56:09,131 --> 00:56:13,124
- Mr. Danforth.
- I tried to tell him, Miss Falsaff.

834
00:56:13,201 --> 00:56:15,669
Really tried.

835
00:56:19,608 --> 00:56:21,803
Something isn't right.

836
00:56:24,579 --> 00:56:29,175
- Hey, look. We need to talk.
- Go.

837
00:56:30,419 --> 00:56:34,856
They must be trying to figure out a way to
make sure Troy and Gabriella beat us out.

838
00:56:34,923 --> 00:56:38,256
The jocks rule most of the school,
but if they get Troy into a musical,

839
00:56:38,327 --> 00:56:41,319
then they've conquered
the entire student body.

840
00:56:41,396 --> 00:56:45,628
And if those science girls get Gabriella
hooked up with Troy Bolton,

841
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:49,501
the scholastic club goes from drool to cool.

842
00:56:49,571 --> 00:56:52,938
Ryan, we need to save our show from
people who don't know the difference

843
00:56:53,008 --> 00:56:56,739
between a Tony Award and Tony Hawk.

844
00:56:58,613 --> 00:57:00,103
Do you think that'll work?

845
00:57:00,182 --> 00:57:03,743
It's the only way to save Troy and Gabriella
from themselves.

846
00:57:03,819 --> 00:57:04,843
- So we on?
- Yeah.

847
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:08,720
- Good. So we start tomorrow then.
- OK, the first thing.

848
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:12,157
- Nice. Let's go.
- Cool.

849
00:57:22,037 --> 00:57:24,096
<i>(bell ringing)</i>

850
00:57:24,172 --> 00:57:27,266
So, my watch is 7:45 Mountain Standard
time. We synched?

851
00:57:27,342 --> 00:57:30,334
- Whatever.
- Then we're on go mode for lunch, 12:05.

852
00:57:30,412 --> 00:57:34,940
Yes, Chad, we're a go.
But we're not <i>Charlie's Angels</i>. OK?

853
00:57:35,017 --> 00:57:37,076
I can dream, can't I?

854
00:57:39,988 --> 00:57:41,853
<i>(bell ringing)</i>

855
00:57:54,336 --> 00:57:58,500
"Spider" Bill Netrine,
class of '72.

856
00:57:58,573 --> 00:58:00,837
He was the MVP in the league
championship game.

857
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:06,575
Sam Nedler, class of '02.
Also known as "Sammy Slamma Jamma."

858
00:58:06,648 --> 00:58:10,379
Captain, MVP of the league
championship team.

859
00:58:10,452 --> 00:58:13,512
The "Thunder Clap," Hap Hadden, '95.

860
00:58:13,588 --> 00:58:16,318
Led the Wildcats to
back-to-back city championships.

861
00:58:16,391 --> 00:58:19,451
- A legend.
- Yes. Legends, one and all.

862
00:58:19,528 --> 00:58:23,988
But do you think that any of these Wildcat
legends became legends

863
00:58:24,066 --> 00:58:28,560
by getting involved in musical auditions
days before the league championships?

864
00:58:28,637 --> 00:58:30,798
- Get your head in the game!
- No.

865
00:58:30,872 --> 00:58:32,669
These Wildcat legends became legends

866
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:35,073
because they never took
their eye off the prize.

867
00:58:35,143 --> 00:58:37,043
Get your head in the game!

868
00:58:37,112 --> 00:58:40,912
Who was the first sophomore ever
to make starting varsity?

869
00:58:40,982 --> 00:58:43,815
- Troy!
- Who voted him team captain this year?

870
00:58:43,885 --> 00:58:47,218
- Us!
- And who is gonna get their butts kicked

871
00:58:47,289 --> 00:58:50,520
in Friday's championship game if Troy's
worried about an audition?

872
00:58:50,592 --> 00:58:52,787
- We are.
- Guys, come on.

873
00:58:52,861 --> 00:58:54,829
There's 12 people on this team,
not just me.

874
00:58:54,896 --> 00:58:57,592
Just 12? Oh, no.

875
00:58:57,666 --> 00:59:03,605
I think you're forgetting about one very
important 13th member of our squad.

876
00:59:06,441 --> 00:59:09,001
- My dad.
- Yes, Troy.

877
00:59:09,077 --> 00:59:13,138
Wildcat basketball champion,
class of 1981.

878
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:18,346
Champion, father, and now coach.

879
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:21,583
It's a winning tradition like no other.

880
00:59:21,656 --> 00:59:26,059
From lowly Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon,
to early warriors, medieval knights.

881
00:59:26,128 --> 00:59:29,427
All leading up to...

882
00:59:29,498 --> 00:59:31,466
...lunkhead basketball man.

883
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:35,629
Yes, our culture worshiped the aggressor
throughout the ages

884
00:59:35,704 --> 00:59:38,673
and we end up with spoiled, overpaid
bonehead athletes

885
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:43,734
who contribute little to civilization other
than slam dunks and touchdowns.

886
00:59:43,812 --> 00:59:48,977
That is the inevitable world
of Troy Bolton.

887
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:51,883
But the path of the mind,
the path we're on,

888
00:59:51,953 --> 00:59:54,751
ours is the path that
has brought us these people:

889
00:59:55,957 --> 01:00:00,121
Eleanor Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo,
Sandra Day O'Connor,

890
01:00:00,195 --> 01:00:03,358
Madame Curie, Jane Goodall,
Oprah Winfrey

891
01:00:03,431 --> 01:00:06,400
and so many others
who the world reveres.

892
01:00:06,468 --> 01:00:11,428
Uh, but, what is?
I've got Kelsi waiting for me to rehearse.

893
01:00:11,506 --> 01:00:13,565
Gabriella!

894
01:00:13,642 --> 01:00:16,873
Troy Bolton represents one side
of evolution.

895
01:00:16,945 --> 01:00:20,608
And our side, the side of education
and accomplishment

896
01:00:20,682 --> 01:00:23,845
is the future of civilization!

897
01:00:23,919 --> 01:00:26,786
This is the side where you belong.

898
01:00:27,822 --> 01:00:33,192
Guys, if you don't know that I'll put
a 110% of my guts into that game,

899
01:00:33,261 --> 01:00:34,523
then you don't know me.

900
01:00:34,596 --> 01:00:37,497
- But we just thought...
- I'll tell you what I thought.

901
01:00:37,566 --> 01:00:41,866
I thought that you're my friends.
Win together, lose together, teammates.

902
01:00:41,937 --> 01:00:46,840
- But suddenly the girl... and the singing.
- Man, I'm for the team!

903
01:00:46,908 --> 01:00:50,105
I've always been for the team.
She's just someone I met.

904
01:00:50,178 --> 01:00:54,080
<i>All right the singing thing is nothing.</i>
<i>A way to keep my nerves down.</i>

905
01:00:54,149 --> 01:00:58,085
<i>It means nothing to me.</i>
<i>You're my guys and this is our team.</i>

906
01:00:58,153 --> 01:01:00,121
<i>Gabriella is not important.</i>

907
01:01:00,188 --> 01:01:05,319
<i>I'll forget about her. Forget the audition</i>
<i>and we'll get that championship.</i>

908
01:01:05,393 --> 01:01:06,724
<i>Everyone happy now?</i>

01:01:06,795 --> 01:01:09,821
Behold lunkhead basketball man.

910
01:01:13,034 --> 01:01:18,563
So, Gabriella, we'd love to have you
for the scholastic decathlon.

911
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,006
Did you wanna grab some lunch?

912
01:01:22,344 --> 01:01:24,812
Well, we'll be there if you wanna come.

913
01:01:26,815 --> 01:01:28,646
- Wildcats!
- Get your head in the game!

914

# I thought you were my fairy tale

# A dream when I'm not sleeping

931

# A wish upon a star that's coming true

932
01:02:47,729 --> 01:02:51,825
# But everybody else could tell

933
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:55,734
# That I confused my feelings with the truth

934

# When there was me and you

935
01:03:04,145 --> 01:03:11,881
# I swore I knew the melody
that I heard you singing

936
01:03:11,953 --> 01:03:19,917
# And when you smiled you made me feel
like I could sing along

937
01:03:19,994 --> 01:03:24,658
# But then you went
and changed the words

938
01:03:24,733 --> 01:03:27,827
# Now my heart is empty

939
01:03:27,902 --> 01:03:34,933
# I'm only left with used-to-bes
and once upon a song

940
01:03:35,577 --> 01:03:39,946
# Now I know your not a fairy tale

941
01:03:40,014 --> 01:03:43,916
# And dreams were meant for sleeping

942
01:03:43,985 --> 01:03:51,687
# And wishes on a star
just don't come true

943
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,163
# 'Cause now even I can tell

944

Hey, how you doin'?

01:05:02,964 --> 01:05:04,727
I wanna talk to you about something.

956
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:08,462
And here it is: I know what it's like
to carry a load with your friends.

957
01:05:08,536 --> 01:05:12,973
I get it. You've got your boys, Troy.
It's OK. So we're good.

958
01:05:13,041 --> 01:05:15,771
Good about what?
I wanna talk about the final callbacks.

959
01:05:15,844 --> 01:05:18,711
I don't wanna do the callbacks either.

960

Who are we trying to kid?
You've got your team and I've got mine.

961
01:05:22,784 --> 01:05:26,220
I'll do the scholastic decathlon
and you'll win the championships.

It's where we belong.

Hey, um...

976
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:31,240
We just had another team meeting.

977
01:07:31,312 --> 01:07:33,212
Oh... wonderful.

978
01:07:33,281 --> 01:07:37,274
We had a team meeting about how
we haven't been acting like a team.

979
01:07:37,352 --> 01:07:39,582
I mean us, not you.

980
01:07:39,654 --> 01:07:42,919
- About the singing thing...
- I don't even wanna talk about it.

981
01:07:42,991 --> 01:07:45,482
We just want you to know
that we're gonna be there.

982
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,687
- Cheering for you.
- Huh?

983
01:07:47,762 --> 01:07:49,320
If singing is what you wanna do,

984
01:07:49,397 --> 01:07:51,388
we should boost you up,
not tear you down.

985
01:07:51,466 --> 01:07:54,060
Yeah. Win or lose, we're teammates.

986
01:07:54,135 --> 01:07:58,572
That's what we're about. Even if you turn
out to be the worst singer in the world.

987
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,541
Which we don't know, because we
haven't heard you sing.

988
01:08:01,609 --> 01:08:04,134
You're not gonna hear me sing, guys.

989
01:08:04,212 --> 01:08:07,773
Because Gabriella won't even talk to me...

990
01:08:07,849 --> 01:08:10,249
...and I don't know why.

991
01:08:13,054 --> 01:08:15,750
We do.

992
01:08:15,823 --> 01:08:17,757
I baked these fresh today.

993
01:08:17,825 --> 01:08:21,556
You'll probably want to try one
before we tell you the rest.

994
01:08:21,629 --> 01:08:24,097
Gabriella, we were jerks.

995
01:08:24,165 --> 01:08:27,430
No, we were worse than jerks
because we were mean jerks.

996
01:08:27,502 --> 01:08:29,834
We thought Troy
and the whole singing thing was

997
01:08:29,904 --> 01:08:32,600
killing our chances of having you
on the scholastic decathlon team.

998
01:08:32,674 --> 01:08:35,472
I heard what he had to say.
I'm on your team now. Done.

999
01:08:35,543 --> 01:08:38,341
No, not done.

1000
01:08:38,413 --> 01:08:40,643
We knew that Chad could get
Troy to say things

1001
01:08:40,715 --> 01:08:43,809
to make you want to
forget about the callbacks.

1002
01:08:43,885 --> 01:08:46,479
We planned it,
and we're embarrassed and sorry.

1003
01:08:46,554 --> 01:08:50,854
No one forced Troy to say anything.
And you know what? It's OK.

1004
01:08:50,925 --> 01:08:53,917
We should prepare for the decathlon,
it's time to move on.

1005
01:08:53,995 --> 01:08:56,623
No, it's not OK.

1006
01:08:56,698 --> 01:09:03,103
The decathlon is whatever, but how you
feel about us, and even more, Troy -

1007
01:09:03,171 --> 01:09:05,935
- that's what really matters.

1008
01:09:13,347 --> 01:09:14,336

Hi, uh... Just came to say I'm sorry.

1011
01:09:36,904 --> 01:09:43,070
- Hi, Miss Montez, I'm Troy Bolton.
- Oh, Troy!

1012
01:09:43,878 --> 01:09:44,970
<i>(mouths)</i> No.

1013
01:09:45,046 --> 01:09:51,645
Um... Gabriella is kind of busy with
homework, so now's not a good time.

1014
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:58,056
I made a mistake, Miss Montez, and I
would really like to let Gabriella know that.

1015
01:09:58,126 --> 01:10:05,032
- Could you tell her I came by to see her?
- I will... Troy.

1016
01:10:05,099 --> 01:10:06,930
- Good night.
- Good night. Thank you.

- What you heard, none of that is true.

1021
01:10:41,369 --> 01:10:44,827
I was sick of my friends riding me,
so I said things to shut them up.

1022
01:10:44,906 --> 01:10:46,066
I didn't mean any of it.

1023

<i>You sounded pretty convincing to me.</i>

1024

The guy you met on vacation is more me
than the guy who said those stupid things.

1025
01:10:53,848 --> 01:10:56,316
The whole singing thing
is making the school whack.

1026
01:10:56,384 --> 01:11:00,184
You said so yourself. Everyone's
treating you differently because of it.

1027
01:11:00,254 --> 01:11:03,018
<i>Maybe because I don't wanna</i>
<i>only be the basketball guy.</i>

1028

<i>They can't handle it.</i>
<i>That's not my problem. It's theirs.</i>

1029
01:11:07,595 --> 01:11:10,428
- How about your dad?
<i>- And it's not about my dad.</i>

1030
01:11:10,498 --> 01:11:14,366
<i>This is about how I feel</i>.
<i>And I'm not letting the team down.</i>

1031
01:11:14,435 --> 01:11:16,665
<i>They let me down.</i>

1032
01:11:16,737 --> 01:11:20,639
<i>So I'm gonna sing. What about you?</i>

1033
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:25,441
- I don't know, Troy.
<i>- Well. You need to say yes.</i>

1034
01:11:25,513 --> 01:11:28,277
<i>Because I brought you something.</i>

1035

Zn4, and by doing that,
you end up with two...

Come here. Go ahead
and put five grams of this in,

01:13:20,361 --> 01:13:23,023
and that causes it to change
from an acidic state.

Causing the color to change from
pink to blue.

OK, our callbacks on Thursday

01:14:23,891 --> 01:14:28,487
and the basketball game

1073

Miss Darbus thinks
she's protecting the show,

1092
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:55,945
but Ryan and Sharpay are
only concerned with protecting themselves.
