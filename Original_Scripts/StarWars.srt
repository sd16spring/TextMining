00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,037
This will begin to make things right.

25
00:02:57,356 --> 00:03:00,404
I've traveled too far
and seen too much

26
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:03,342
to ignore the despair
in the Galaxy.

27
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:08,139
Without the Jedi, there can be
no balance in the Force.

28
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:10,601
Well, because of you,
now we have a chance.

29
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:12,929
The general has been after
for this for a long time.

30
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,685
The General?

31
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,096
To me she's royalty.

32
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,363
Well, she certainly is that.

33
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:26,764
We got company.

34
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:40,361
You have to hide.

35
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,244
You have to leave.

36
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:45,421
Go.

37
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,811
Get out!
Go! Go! Go!

38
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:18,296
Come on BB-8, hurry!

39
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,669
Blast that X-wing!
Fire! Fire!

40
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:39,470
Someone is coming behind us.

41
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:40,888
I see him!

42
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:15,358
And take this, it's safer
with you than it's with me.

43
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,736
You get as far away
from here as you can.

44
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:20,632
- Do you hear me?
- I don't know...

45
00:05:20,657 --> 00:05:22,593
I'll come back for you!

46
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:24,580
We'll be alright!

47
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,144
Keep moving!

48
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:28,551
Stay here.

49
00:06:51,683 --> 00:06:54,647
Look how old you'd become.

50
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:58,177
Something far worse
has happened to you.

51
00:06:58,843 --> 00:07:01,197
You know what I've come for.

52
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:03,288
I know where you come from.

53
00:07:03,313 --> 00:07:05,804
Before you you call 'Kylo Ren'.

54
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:10,120
The Map, to Skywalker.
We know you found it.

55
00:07:10,325 --> 00:07:12,895
And now you're going to
give it to the First Order.

56
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,003
The First Order rose
from the dark side.

57
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:17,536
You did not.

58
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:21,030
I'll show you
the dark side.

59
00:07:21,055 --> 00:07:22,600
You may try.

60
00:07:22,871 --> 00:07:27,521
But you cannot deny the truth
that is your family.

61
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:29,392
You're so right.

62
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:05,654
So, who talks first?
Do you talk first? I talk first?

63
00:08:05,992 --> 00:08:07,753
The old man gave it to you.

64
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,762
It's very hard to understand you
with all the...

65
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:12,367
- Search him.
- I'm more than...

66
00:08:15,552 --> 00:08:18,180
- Nothing, sir.
- Bring him on board.

67
00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:26,747
Sir, the villagers?

68
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,121
Kill them all.

69
00:08:31,107 --> 00:08:33,000
On my command.

70
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,169
Fire!

71
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:37,747
No!

72
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:08,243
Nothing here!
Eliminate it!

73
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:12,284
Huh?

74
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:51,134
Alright.
Alright!

75
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:18,619
FN-2187.

76
00:10:18,644 --> 00:10:21,960
Submit your blaster for inspection.

77
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:23,765
Yes, Captain.

78
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,972
And who gave you permission
to remove that helmet?

79
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,135
I'm sorry, Captain.

80
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,246
Report to my division at once.

81
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,385
What you brought me today
is worth...

82
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:25,986
One quarter portion.

83
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:41,425
 (AT-AT)

84
00:15:05,582 --> 00:15:06,816
Huh?

85
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,028
Oh, thank you.

86
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:24,904
Shhh.

87
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:29,514
That's just a Teedo.
Wants you for parts.

88
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:32,002
He has no respect for anyone.

89
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:33,576
Oh.

90
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,813
Your antenna's bent.

91
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,309
Where'd you come from?

92
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:50,438
I am not suppose to tell,
it's classified.

93
00:15:50,463 --> 00:15:52,159
- Classified, really?
- Yup.

94
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,489
Me too.
Big secret.

95
00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:57,969
Niima Outpost is that way.
Stay off Kelvin Ridge.

96
00:15:57,994 --> 00:15:59,808
Keep away from the
sinking fields in the North

97
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,948
or you'll drown in the sand.

98
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:05,925
You are so very kind.
I would like to come with you.

99
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:09,610
Don't follow me.
The town is that way.

100
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,814
Oh.
Then, can I stay with you?

101
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,439
No!

102
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:17,129
I am scared.

103
00:16:25,604 --> 00:16:27,087
Yay!

104
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:31,957
In the morning, you go.

105
00:16:33,444 --> 00:16:35,716
Thank you, again.

106
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:39,036
You're welcome.

107
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:54,814
I have no idea we had the best pilot
in the Resistance on board.

108
00:16:56,728 --> 00:16:58,276
You comfortable?

109
00:16:58,301 --> 00:16:59,946
Not really.

110
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:02,726
I'm impressed.

111
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,239
No one has been able
to get out of you

112
00:17:07,264 --> 00:17:10,465
what you did with the map.

113
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,221
You might want to
rethink your technique.

114
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:30,890
Where is it?

115
00:17:32,664 --> 00:17:36,999
The Resistance will not be
intimidated by you.

116
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:43,608
Where is it?

117
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:51,038
AAWWWW !!

118
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:56,050
It's in a droid.
A BB unit.

119
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,608
Well then, if it's on Jakku,
we'll soon have it.

120
00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:00,678
I leave that to you.

121
00:18:02,252 --> 00:18:05,192
Don't give up hope.
He still might show up.

122
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:09,221
Whoever it's you're waiting for.
Classified.

123
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:11,661
I know all about waiting

124
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:15,082
For my family.

125
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,388
They'll be back,
one day.

126
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:20,259
Come on.

127
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,436
These five pieces are worth...

128
00:18:26,461 --> 00:18:28,301
Let me see...

129
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:32,042
One half portion.

130
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,799
Last week they were
a half portion each.

131
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,900
What about the droid?

132
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:39,634
What about him?

133
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:41,890
I'll pay for him.

134
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,119
Wow.

135
00:18:47,763 --> 00:18:49,721
60 portions.

136
00:18:49,746 --> 00:18:51,803
- Whoa.
- Wow.

137
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:03,675
Actually.

138
00:19:04,846 --> 00:19:06,935
The droid is not for sale.

139
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:10,576
Come on.

140
00:19:14,443 --> 00:19:17,730
Follow the girl
and get that droid.

141
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:22,742
Ren wants the prisoner.

142
00:19:31,397 --> 00:19:32,817
Turn here.

143
00:19:34,617 --> 00:19:35,770
Listen carefully.

144
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:38,064
If you do exactly as I say,
I can get you out of here.

145
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:39,489
What?

146
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,504
This is a rescue.
I'm helping you escape.

147
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:44,230
Can you fly a TIE fighter?

148
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,483
You are with the Resistance?

149
00:19:45,508 --> 00:19:47,469
What? No no no.
I'm breaking you out.

150
00:19:47,494 --> 00:19:50,209
- Can you fly a TIE fighter?
- I can fly anything.

151
00:19:50,234 --> 00:19:53,339
Why?
Why are you helping me?

152
00:19:54,023 --> 00:19:56,409
Because it's the right thing to do.

153
00:19:56,886 --> 00:19:58,024
You need a pilot.

154
00:19:58,025 --> 00:19:59,725
I need a pilot.

155
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,284
We're gonna do this.

156
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:03,560
Yeah?

157
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:09,942
Okay, stay calm, stay calm.

158
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:11,194
I am calm.

159
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:13,067
I'm talking to myself.

160
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:16,549
Not yet.

161
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,826
Okay, go.
This way.

162
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:27,874
I always wanted to fly
one of these things.

163
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:29,886
- Can you shoot?
- Blasters, I can.

164
00:20:29,914 --> 00:20:31,320
Okay, same principle.

165
00:20:31,345 --> 00:20:34,461
Use the toggle on the left to switch
between missiles, cannons and Mag pulses.

166
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:36,627
The sight on the right to aim,
triggers to fire.

167
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,611
This is very complicated.

168
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:46,125
I can fix this.

169
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:51,405
We have an unsanctioned
departure from Bay 2.

170
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,879
Alert General Hux,
and stop that fighter.

171
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:16,369
Blow up the command.

172
00:21:17,886 --> 00:21:19,409
I got it.

173
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,295
This thing really moves.

174
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,424
Alright, we got to take out as
many of these cannons as we can

175
00:21:31,449 --> 00:21:32,959
- if we're gonna get very far.
- Alright.

176
00:21:32,984 --> 00:21:36,101
I'm going to get us in position.
Just stay sharp.

177
00:21:38,077 --> 00:21:40,209
Up ahead! Up ahead!
Do you see it?

178
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:41,957
I got us dead centered.
It's a clean shot.

179
00:21:41,982 --> 00:21:43,427
I got it.

180
00:21:51,392 --> 00:21:52,775
- Yeah!
- Yes!

181
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,256
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

182
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:55,972
I saw it!

183
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:03,455
- Hey. What's your name?
- FN-2187.

184
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,904
F... what?

185
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:06,778
That's the only name
they ever gave me.

186
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:09,567
Well, I ain't using it.
FN, huh?

187
00:22:09,592 --> 00:22:11,770
Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn.
Is it alright?

188
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:14,109
Finn. Yeah!
Finn, I like that!

189
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,210
I like that.

190
00:22:15,211 --> 00:22:16,525
I'm Poe, Poe Dameron.

191
00:22:16,526 --> 00:22:19,224
- Good to meet you, Poe.
- Good to meet you too, Finn!

192
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:24,942
Sir, they've taken out our turbo lasers.

193
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:27,043
Use the ventral cannons.

194
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:28,907
Yes, sir.
Bringing them online.

195
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:31,854
General Hux,
is it the Resistance pilot?

196
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:36,177
Yes, and he had helped
from one of our own.

197
00:22:36,336 --> 00:22:39,694
We are checking the registers now
to identify which Stormtrooper it was.

198
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:43,537
The one from the Village.
FN-2187.

199
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:46,292
Sir, ventral cannons on.

200
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:48,047
Fire.

201
00:22:56,352 --> 00:22:58,897
What's coming towards you?
My right. Your left. Do you see it?

202
00:22:58,898 --> 00:23:01,588
Hold on.
I see them!

203
00:23:04,438 --> 00:23:06,052
Nice shot!

204
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,283
Where're we going?

205
00:23:13,284 --> 00:23:14,732
We're going back to Jakku,
that's where.

206
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:16,373
No, no, no.
We can't go back to Jakku.

207
00:23:16,398 --> 00:23:17,601
We need to get out
of this system.

208
00:23:17,626 --> 00:23:19,770
I got to get my droid
before the First Order does.

209
00:23:19,771 --> 00:23:21,131
- What? A droid?
- That's right.

210
00:23:21,156 --> 00:23:23,203
The BB unit, orange and white.
One of a kind.

211
00:23:23,242 --> 00:23:25,575
I don't care what color he is!
No droid can be that important!

212
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:26,718
This one is, man.

213
00:23:26,743 --> 00:23:28,489
We need to get as far away
from the First Order as we can.

214
00:23:28,514 --> 00:23:30,209
We go back to Jakku,
we die.

215
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,878
The droid has a map that leads
straight to Luke Skywalker.

216
00:23:32,903 --> 00:23:35,273
Oh, you got to be kidding me!

217
00:23:38,034 --> 00:23:43,624
FN-2187 reported to my division,
was evaluated and sent to reconditioning.

218
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:45,799
No prior signs of nonconformity?

219
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,748
This was his first offense.

220
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:49,897
General.
They've been hit.

221
00:23:49,922 --> 00:23:51,874
- Destroyed?
- Disabled.

222
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,394
They've headed back to Jakku.

223
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:55,665
The CIS projected the crash
in the Goazon Badlands.

224
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,596
They were going
back for the droid.

225
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:59,810
Send a squad to the wreckage.

226
00:24:21,841 --> 00:24:23,389
Poe!

227
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:25,840
Poe!

228
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:27,770
Poe!

229
00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:32,773
Poe! I got you.

230
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,925
Poe!

231
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,739
Poe!

232
00:26:10,294 --> 00:26:11,461
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit.

233
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,604
Capture the droid if we can,
but destroy it, we must.

234
00:26:12,629 --> 00:26:14,283
How capable are your soldiers, General?

235
00:26:14,308 --> 00:26:16,029
I won't have you
question my methods.

236
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,093
They are obviously skilled
at committing high treason.

237
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,615
Perhaps Leader Snoke should
consider using a clone army.

238
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,431
My men are exceptionally trained.
Programmed from birth.

239
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:26,041
Then, they should have
no problem retrieving the droid,

240
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:27,502
unharmed.

241
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,775
Careful, Ren, that your personal interest
not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke.

242
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,073
I want that map.

243
00:26:35,074 --> 00:26:38,743
For your sake,
I suggest you get it.

244
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:46,605
Water.
Water.

245
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:48,526
- Water.
- No.

246
00:26:50,453 --> 00:26:52,056
There's no water?

247
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:19,186
Girl, your droid.
I want it.

248
00:27:19,211 --> 00:27:20,608
- Huh?
- What?

249
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:22,581
Oi!
Get away from him!

250
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:33,324
Hey!

251
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:42,623
Huh?

252
00:27:46,735 --> 00:27:49,087
Who are those people.

253
00:27:49,112 --> 00:27:50,736
They work for Unkar.

254
00:27:55,649 --> 00:27:57,689
Mistress! That man!

255
00:27:57,714 --> 00:27:59,014
Who?

256
00:27:59,716 --> 00:28:00,580
That man over there.

257
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:01,751
- Him?
- Yes.

258
00:28:01,776 --> 00:28:03,901
He is wearing my master's jacket.

259
00:28:20,834 --> 00:28:22,201
What is your hurry, thief?

260
00:28:22,226 --> 00:28:24,444
What?
Thief?

261
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:26,288
Oww!
Hey! What?

262
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:29,328
The jacket.
This droid says you stole it.

263
00:28:29,544 --> 00:28:31,229
I had a pretty
messed up day, alright?

264
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,606
So I'd appreciate it if
you'd stop accusing me...

265
00:28:33,607 --> 00:28:35,932
- Ow! Stop it!
- Where did you get it?

266
00:28:35,957 --> 00:28:37,950
It belongs to his master.

267
00:28:40,894 --> 00:28:44,840
It belongs to Poe Dameron.
That was his name, right?

268
00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:48,942
He was captured
by the First Order.

269
00:28:48,967 --> 00:28:51,958
I helped him escape,
our ship crashed.

270
00:28:54,589 --> 00:28:56,331
Poe didn't make it.

271
00:28:56,886 --> 00:28:58,337
Ohhh.

272
00:29:00,482 --> 00:29:03,132
I tried to help him
but I'm sorry.

273
00:29:10,644 --> 00:29:12,790
So you're with the Resistance?

274
00:29:17,158 --> 00:29:18,585
Obviously.

275
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,179
Yes, I am

276
00:29:20,204 --> 00:29:23,690
I'm with the Resistance, yeah.
I'm with the Resistance.

277
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:27,565
I never met a
Resistance fighter before.

278
00:29:28,721 --> 00:29:31,316
I was... that's what we look like.
Some of us.

279
00:29:31,341 --> 00:29:32,907
Others look different.

280
00:29:32,932 --> 00:29:35,951
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission.
He has to get back to your base.

281
00:29:35,952 --> 00:29:38,273
Apparently he has a map
that leads to Luke Skywalker.

282
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:40,383
And everyone is after it.

283
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,471
Luke Skywalker?

284
00:29:42,803 --> 00:29:44,637
I thought he was a myth.

285
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:46,540
What?

286
00:29:54,677 --> 00:29:56,928
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

287
00:29:57,312 --> 00:29:58,897
Come on, BB-8!

288
00:30:01,974 --> 00:30:03,608
- Let go of me!
- Come on! We got to move!

289
00:30:03,633 --> 00:30:06,516
I know how to run
without you holding my hand.

290
00:30:07,883 --> 00:30:10,032
BB-8, stay close!

291
00:30:10,057 --> 00:30:11,605
This way.

292
00:30:16,932 --> 00:30:18,878
Call in the air strike.

293
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,151
They're shooting at both of us.

294
00:30:23,176 --> 00:30:25,297
Yeah, they saw you with me.
You are marked.

295
00:30:25,322 --> 00:30:26,472
Well, thanks for that.

296
00:30:26,497 --> 00:30:29,402
Hey! I'm not the one to
take you down with a stick.

297
00:30:29,652 --> 00:30:31,334
Does anyone have blasters around here?

298
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,919
Are you okay?

299
00:30:33,148 --> 00:30:34,784
Shh. Shh.
Shhh.

300
00:30:38,572 --> 00:30:41,155
Stop taking my hand!

301
00:30:56,482 --> 00:30:57,782
Hey.

302
00:31:00,812 --> 00:31:02,442
Are you okay?

303
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:05,056
Yeah.

304
00:31:05,081 --> 00:31:06,509
Follow me.

305
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:18,419
We can't outrun them!

306
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:20,548
We might.
In that Quad-Jumper!

307
00:31:20,573 --> 00:31:22,281
Hey!
We need a pilot!

308
00:31:22,306 --> 00:31:23,679
We got one.

309
00:31:23,704 --> 00:31:25,004
You?

310
00:31:25,822 --> 00:31:27,489
What about that ship?

311
00:31:27,514 --> 00:31:29,564
That one's GARBAGE!

312
00:31:34,197 --> 00:31:36,251
The garbage will do.

313
00:31:51,832 --> 00:31:53,987
Gunner position is down there!

314
00:31:56,687 --> 00:31:58,505
You ever fly this thing?

315
00:31:58,506 --> 00:32:01,628
No!
This ship hasn't flown in years.

316
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:02,998
Great.

317
00:32:08,732 --> 00:32:10,751
I can do this.
I can do this.

318
00:32:10,776 --> 00:32:13,592
I can do this.
I can do this.

319
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:35,025
Hey!

320
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:41,376
That's mine!

321
00:32:43,949 --> 00:32:45,777
Hold!
Stay low! Stay low!

322
00:32:45,802 --> 00:32:46,802
What?

323
00:32:46,827 --> 00:32:48,506
Stay low!
It confuses their tracking.

324
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:50,637
- BB-8, hold on.
- Whyee?

325
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:52,413
I'm going low!

326
00:33:10,312 --> 00:33:11,800
What are you doing back there?

327
00:33:11,801 --> 00:33:13,158
Are you ever going to fire back?

328
00:33:13,183 --> 00:33:15,209
I'm working on it!
Are the shields up?

329
00:33:15,234 --> 00:33:17,206
 Not so easy without a co-pilot.

330
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:19,319
Try sitting in this thing.

331
00:33:33,436 --> 00:33:36,343
- We need cover, quick.
- We're about to get some!

332
00:33:36,368 --> 00:33:37,768
I hope.

333
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:54,203
Whoa.

334
00:34:03,568 --> 00:34:04,894
Damn it.

335
00:34:15,813 --> 00:34:17,767
Come on, come on!

336
00:34:20,322 --> 00:34:21,436
Nice shot!

337
00:34:21,461 --> 00:34:23,115
I'm getting pretty good at this.

338
00:34:25,702 --> 00:34:27,615
Let's get down!

339
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,695
Alright. The cannon's stuck in
forward position. I can't move it.

340
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,423
You got to lose them.

341
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:44,868
Get ready!

342
00:34:44,893 --> 00:34:47,107
Okay.
For what?

343
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:01,963
Are we really doing this?

344
00:35:10,437 --> 00:35:11,806
Oh, no.

345
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:35,107
Whoa!

346
00:35:48,681 --> 00:35:50,053
- That was some flying.
- Nice shooting.

347
00:35:50,078 --> 00:35:51,364
- Thanks.
- How did you do that?

348
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:52,917
- I don't know.
- No one trained you?

349
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,247
But I've never left the planet.

350
00:35:54,272 --> 00:35:55,740
- Your last shot was great.
- That was amazing.

351
00:35:55,741 --> 00:35:57,408
You set me up for it.

352
00:35:57,433 --> 00:35:59,454
- It was perfect.
- That was pretty good.

353
00:36:02,091 --> 00:36:04,656
You're okay.
He's with the Resistance.

354
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:05,606
Hmm.

355
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:07,457
He's going to get you home.

356
00:36:08,498 --> 00:36:10,058
We both will.

357
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:16,912
I don't know your name.

358
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,627
Finn.
What's yours?

359
00:36:21,037 --> 00:36:22,589
I'm Rey.

360
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,251
Rey...

361
00:36:28,935 --> 00:36:31,300
Help me with this.
Quick!

362
00:36:31,325 --> 00:36:33,616
What-What's going on?

363
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,044
Sir, we were unable to
acquire the droid on Jakku.

364
00:36:50,145 --> 00:36:54,766
He escaped capture on a stolen
Corellian YT model freighter.

365
00:36:55,436 --> 00:36:59,182
The droid... stole a freighter?

366
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,982
Not exactly, sir.

367
00:37:01,697 --> 00:37:03,445
It had help.

368
00:37:05,986 --> 00:37:07,265
We have no confirmation,

369
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,995
but we believe FN-2187
may have helped him escape.

370
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:30,047
Anything else?

371
00:37:31,905 --> 00:37:34,450
The two were accompanied by a girl.

372
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,812
What girl?

373
00:37:43,149 --> 00:37:44,332
It's the motivator.

374
00:37:44,357 --> 00:37:46,022
Grab me a Harris wrench.
Check in there.

375
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:48,566
- How bad is it?
- If we want to live, not good.

376
00:37:48,591 --> 00:37:51,237
They're hunting for us now.
We got to get out of this system!

377
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:53,688
BB-8 says the location of the
Resistance base is 'need to know.'

378
00:37:53,713 --> 00:37:55,699
If I'm taking you there,
I need to know.

379
00:37:55,724 --> 00:37:57,086
This?

380
00:37:58,258 --> 00:37:59,627
You got to tell us
where your base is.

381
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,779
What?
No.

382
00:38:00,804 --> 00:38:02,347
I don't speak that.

383
00:38:02,372 --> 00:38:06,333
Okay, between us,
I'm not with the Resistance, okay?

384
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:08,302
I'm just trying to get away
from the First Order.

385
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,946
But if you tell us
where the base is,

386
00:38:09,971 --> 00:38:12,421
I'll get you there first.
Deal?

387
00:38:12,446 --> 00:38:13,553
Droid, please!

388
00:38:13,578 --> 00:38:15,112
Pilex driver, hurry.

389
00:38:15,137 --> 00:38:17,189
- So,where is your base?
- Go on, BB-8, tell her .

390
00:38:17,214 --> 00:38:18,509
Huh?
Eh.

391
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:20,230
Huh?
Eh.

392
00:38:20,255 --> 00:38:21,176
Huh?

393
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:22,739
Please.

394
00:38:23,828 --> 00:38:26,092
- The  Ileenium System!
- Yes, the Ileenium System.

395
00:38:26,093 --> 00:38:28,145
That's the one.
Get us there as fast as you can.

396
00:38:29,727 --> 00:38:31,125
I need the engine tape, hurry.

397
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,196
- What about you?
- I got to get back to Jakku?

398
00:38:33,221 --> 00:38:35,877
Back to Jakk... Why does everyone
want to go back to Jakku?

399
00:38:35,902 --> 00:38:37,043
- It's not that one.
- That place is...

400
00:38:37,068 --> 00:38:38,552
No.
No.

401
00:38:38,577 --> 00:38:39,930
The one I'm pointing to.

402
00:38:39,955 --> 00:38:42,185
No. No.
No!

403
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:44,179
If we don't patches up the
propulsion, the tank will overflow

404
00:38:44,204 --> 00:38:46,458
and fill up this ship
with poisonous gas.

405
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:48,250
- This?
- Yes.

406
00:38:48,632 --> 00:38:51,594
Hey, Rey, 
you're a pilot.

407
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:53,715
You can fly anywhere.
Why go back?

408
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,047
You got a family?

409
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:56,416
You got a boyfriend?
A cute boyfriend?

410
00:38:56,441 --> 00:38:58,364
None of your business, that's why.

411
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:02,602
- That can't be good.
- To the cockpit.

412
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:10,868
Someone's locked on to us.
All controls are overridden.

413
00:39:16,747 --> 00:39:18,926
Get off.
Get off!

414
00:39:20,931 --> 00:39:22,480
Do you see anything?

415
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,458
Oh, no.

416
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:33,439
It's the First order.

417
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,893
What do we do?
There must be something.

418
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:37,671
- You said poisonous gas.
- I fixed that.

419
00:39:37,696 --> 00:39:39,350
Can you unfix it?

420
00:39:44,603 --> 00:39:46,246
Come on, BB-8.

421
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:47,819
I got him.

422
00:39:50,409 --> 00:39:51,794
I'm okay.

423
00:39:56,498 --> 00:39:57,930
Do you think this work
on the Stormtroopers?

424
00:39:57,955 --> 00:40:01,227
Yeah, their masks filter out
smoke not toxins.

425
00:40:08,343 --> 00:40:10,141
Hurry, they're coming.

426
00:40:21,172 --> 00:40:25,347
Chewie.
We're home.

427
00:40:40,734 --> 00:40:42,644
Where are the others?
Where's the pilot?

428
00:40:42,669 --> 00:40:44,039
I'm the pilot.

429
00:40:44,064 --> 00:40:45,269
- You?
- She's lying.

430
00:40:45,294 --> 00:40:47,397
No, it's true.
We're the only ones on board.

431
00:40:47,422 --> 00:40:48,584
You can understand that thing?

432
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:50,855
And "that thing" can
understand you too, so watch it.

433
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,442
Come on out of there.

434
00:40:53,823 --> 00:40:56,092
- Where did you get this ship?
- Niima Outpost.

435
00:40:56,093 --> 00:40:58,246
Jakku?
That junkyard?

436
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,447
Thank you!
Junkyard.

437
00:40:59,448 --> 00:41:02,051
I told you we should've double
check the Western Reaches.

438
00:41:02,052 --> 00:41:03,542
Who had her?
Ducain?

439
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:05,895
I stole it.
From Unkar Plutt.

440
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,236
He stole it from the Irving Boys,
who stole it from Ducain.

441
00:41:08,261 --> 00:41:10,266
Who stole it from me!

442
00:41:10,353 --> 00:41:12,604
Well, you tell him that
Han Solo just stole back

443
00:41:12,629 --> 00:41:14,616
the Millennium Falcon, for good

444
00:41:14,617 --> 00:41:18,137
This is the "Millennium Falcon"?
You are Han Solo?

445
00:41:19,004 --> 00:41:20,779
I used to be.

446
00:41:21,225 --> 00:41:22,910
Han Solo, the Rebellion general?

447
00:41:22,935 --> 00:41:24,281
No, the smuggler.

448
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:26,072
Wasn't he a war hero?

449
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:29,534
This is the ship that made
the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs.

450
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:31,052
12!

451
00:41:32,086 --> 00:41:33,832
14.

452
00:41:48,755 --> 00:41:50,134
Hey!

453
00:41:50,385 --> 00:41:53,451
Some moof milker put a compressor
on the ignition line.

454
00:41:53,452 --> 00:41:54,573
Unkar Plutt did it.

455
00:41:54,574 --> 00:41:56,090
I thought it was a mistake too.
Puts too much...

456
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:58,425
- ... stress on the hyperdrive.
- Stress on the hyperdrive.

457
00:41:59,414 --> 00:42:00,962
Chewie, throw them in a pod.

458
00:42:00,963 --> 00:42:03,451
We'll drop them on the
nearest uninhabited planet.

459
00:42:03,476 --> 00:42:06,083
Wait, no!
We need your help.

460
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:07,174
My help?

461
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:10,815
This droid has to get to the
Resistance base as soon as possible.

462
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:13,724
He's carrying a map
to Luke Skywalker.

463
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:21,026
You are the Han Solo
that fought with the Rebellion.

464
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,373
You knew him.

465
00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:33,944
Yeah, I knew him.

466
00:42:34,138 --> 00:42:36,036
I knew Luke.

467
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,909
Don't tell me a
Rathtar's gotten loose.

468
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,528
Wait, what?

469
00:42:43,642 --> 00:42:45,707
Did you just say 'Rathtar'?

470
00:42:46,145 --> 00:42:47,180
Hey!

471
00:42:47,205 --> 00:42:50,008
You're not hauling Rathtars
on this freighter, are you?

472
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,127
I'm hauling Rathtars.

473
00:42:52,337 --> 00:42:55,774
Oh, great.
It's the Guavian Death Gang .

474
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:57,589
They must've tracked us from Nantoon.

475
00:42:57,614 --> 00:42:58,991
What is a rathtar?

476
00:42:59,016 --> 00:43:00,671
They are big and
they are dangerous.

477
00:43:00,672 --> 00:43:02,427
You ever heard of the Trillia massacre?

478
00:43:02,452 --> 00:43:03,767
- No.
- Good.

479
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:05,609
I got three of them
going to King Prana.

480
00:43:05,634 --> 00:43:07,959
Three?
How did you get them on board?

481
00:43:07,973 --> 00:43:10,421
We used to have a bigger crew.

482
00:43:13,483 --> 00:43:15,342
Get below and stay there
until I say so.

483
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:17,066
And don't even think
about taking the Falcon.

484
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:18,211
What about BB-8?

485
00:43:18,236 --> 00:43:19,686
He stays with me until
I get rid of the gang,

486
00:43:19,711 --> 00:43:21,335
then you can have him back
and be on your way.

487
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,677
What about the Rathtars?
Where're you keeping them?

488
00:43:25,682 --> 00:43:26,759
There's one.

489
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,036
What are you going to do?

490
00:43:28,061 --> 00:43:30,222
Same thing I always do.
Talk my way out of it.

491
00:43:30,247 --> 00:43:31,423
Do you?

492
00:43:31,448 --> 00:43:34,137
Yes, I do.
Every time.

493
00:43:50,852 --> 00:43:54,638
Han Solo,
you are a dead man.

494
00:43:54,663 --> 00:43:57,524
Bala-Tik.
What's the problem?

495
00:43:57,549 --> 00:44:00,426
The problem is that we
loaned you 50,000 for this job.

496
00:44:00,427 --> 00:44:01,589
Can you see them?

497
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:02,990
No.

498
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:06,184
I heard you also borrowed
50,000 from Kanjiklub.

499
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:09,028
You know you can't
trust those little freaks.

500
00:44:09,052 --> 00:44:11,365
How long we known each other?

501
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,886
- They have blasters.
- A lot of them.

502
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:17,220
Not long.
We want our money back now.

503
00:44:17,245 --> 00:44:20,402
You think hunting Rathtars is cheap?
I spent that money.

504
00:44:20,427 --> 00:44:22,962
Kanjiklub wants their investment back too.

505
00:44:22,963 --> 00:44:25,201
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

506
00:44:25,226 --> 00:44:27,551
Tell that to Kanjiklub.

507
00:44:36,585 --> 00:44:40,206
Tasu Leech!
Good to see you!

508
00:44:40,207 --> 00:44:44,604
You made another mistake, Solo.
This is your intention.

509
00:44:48,655 --> 00:44:51,826
Boys! You both're gonna
get what I promised.

510
00:44:51,827 --> 00:44:54,120
Have I ever not
deliver for you before?

511
00:44:54,145 --> 00:44:55,210
Yeah.

512
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:57,168
Twice.

513
00:44:58,968 --> 00:45:00,501
What was the second time?

514
00:45:00,502 --> 00:45:01,842
Your game is old.

515
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,673
There's no one in the galaxy
left for you to swindle.

516
00:45:04,698 --> 00:45:06,762
You have nowhere to hide.

517
00:45:07,026 --> 00:45:08,439
That BB unit.

518
00:45:08,464 --> 00:45:11,820
The First Order is looking
for one just like it.

519
00:45:14,651 --> 00:45:16,824
And two fugitives.

520
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,180
First time I heard of it.

521
00:45:21,205 --> 00:45:23,437
- Search the freighter.
- On it.

522
00:45:26,778 --> 00:45:28,174
Wait, wait, wait...

523
00:45:31,224 --> 00:45:34,467
If we close the blast doors in that
corridor, we can trap those gangs.

524
00:45:34,492 --> 00:45:35,970
Close the blast doors from here?

525
00:45:35,995 --> 00:45:38,237
Resetting the fuses should do it.

526
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:47,726
I got a bad feeling about this.

527
00:45:47,751 --> 00:45:48,831
Oh, no.

528
00:45:48,856 --> 00:45:50,317
"Oh no," what?

529
00:45:50,924 --> 00:45:51,949
Wrong fuses.

530
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,184
Kill them!

531
00:45:53,185 --> 00:45:54,861
And take the droid!

532
00:46:20,098 --> 00:46:22,657
- This was a mistake!
- Huge!

533
00:46:35,345 --> 00:46:37,046
How do they look?

534
00:46:42,393 --> 00:46:43,978
They look like that.

535
00:46:46,449 --> 00:46:48,817
- This way.
- Are you sure?

536
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:52,295
No!
No, no, no.

537
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,723
Finn!

538
00:46:54,802 --> 00:46:56,179
Finn!

539
00:46:57,506 --> 00:46:59,077
REY!

540
00:47:00,493 --> 00:47:02,020
Get out of here!

541
00:47:07,863 --> 00:47:08,850
Rey!

542
00:47:08,851 --> 00:47:10,451
Finn!

543
00:47:11,478 --> 00:47:12,911
Finn!

544
00:47:13,267 --> 00:47:15,049
Get it off me!

545
00:47:32,646 --> 00:47:34,520
Get off!
Get off!

546
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:37,644
Finn!

547
00:47:38,461 --> 00:47:39,818
It had me!
But the door...

548
00:47:39,843 --> 00:47:41,439
That was lucky.

549
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:46,864
I got the door.
Cover us!

550
00:47:53,906 --> 00:47:54,851
AAWWW!

551
00:47:54,876 --> 00:47:56,176
Chewie!

552
00:47:58,707 --> 00:48:00,128
Are you okay?

553
00:48:00,153 --> 00:48:01,325
Yeah.

554
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,024
Wow.

555
00:48:04,732 --> 00:48:06,391
Come on!
Come on!

556
00:48:10,646 --> 00:48:12,636
- Han
- You, close the door behind us.

557
00:48:12,661 --> 00:48:14,557
You, take care of Chewie!

558
00:48:14,582 --> 00:48:16,041
Awww!

559
00:48:21,771 --> 00:48:23,132
Hey.
Where're you going?

560
00:48:23,157 --> 00:48:24,778
Unkar Plutt installed
a fuel pump here.

561
00:48:24,803 --> 00:48:26,679
If we don't prime that,
we're not going anywhere..

562
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:27,841
I hate that guy.

563
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:31,343
- And you could use a co-pilot.
- I got one, he's back there.

564
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,049
Watch the thrusters.
We're getting out of here in light speed.

565
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,920
From inside of a hanger?
Is that even possible?

566
00:48:36,945 --> 00:48:40,063
I never ask that question
until after I've done it.

567
00:48:41,391 --> 00:48:43,653
This is not how I thought
this day was going to go.

568
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,799
Angle the shield.
Hang on back there!

569
00:48:45,831 --> 00:48:47,447
No problem!

570
00:48:56,882 --> 00:48:59,068
Come on, baby,
don't let me down.

571
00:49:00,617 --> 00:49:02,766
- What?
- Compressor.

572
00:49:11,095 --> 00:49:14,354
Inform the First Order that
Han Solo has the droid they wanted.

573
00:49:14,379 --> 00:49:16,994
And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon.

574
00:49:25,151 --> 00:49:30,362
The droid will soon be
delivered to the Resistance,

575
00:49:30,803 --> 00:49:34,906
leading them to the last Jedi.

576
00:49:35,702 --> 00:49:39,841
If Skywalker returns,

577
00:49:39,866 --> 00:49:44,484
the new Jedi will rise.

578
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:46,885
Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility....

579
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:49,305
General!

580
00:49:50,511 --> 00:49:53,714
Our strategy must now change.

581
00:49:53,739 --> 00:49:55,954
The weapon.
It is ready.

582
00:49:55,979 --> 00:49:58,149
I believe the time
has come to use it.

583
00:49:58,174 --> 00:50:01,176
We shall destroy the government
that supports the Resistance.

584
00:50:01,201 --> 00:50:02,643
The Republic.

585
00:50:02,668 --> 00:50:06,055
Without their friends to protect them,
the Resistance will be vulnerable.

586
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,109
And we will stop them
before they reach Skywalker.

587
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:10,888
Go,

588
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:12,883
oversee preparations.

589
00:50:12,908 --> 00:50:15,286
Yes, Supreme Leader.

590
00:50:20,135 --> 00:50:22,925
There has been an awakening.

591
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,451
Have you felt it?

592
00:50:26,789 --> 00:50:28,285
Yes.

593
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,497
There's something more.

594
00:50:32,373 --> 00:50:37,336
The droid we seek is
aboard the Millennium Falcon.

595
00:50:37,361 --> 00:50:40,627
In the hands of your father,

596
00:50:40,652 --> 00:50:44,823
Han Solo.

597
00:50:46,772 --> 00:50:48,875
He means nothing to me.

598
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:54,628
Even you, Master of the Knights of Ren,

599
00:50:54,653 --> 00:50:58,256
have never faced such a test.

600
00:50:58,582 --> 00:51:02,455
By the grace of your training,
I will not be seduced.

601
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,017
We shall see.

602
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:10,227
We shall see.

603
00:51:17,323 --> 00:51:20,111
- Electrical overload.
- I can fix that.

604
00:51:20,136 --> 00:51:21,982
Coolant's leaking.

605
00:51:22,181 --> 00:51:24,005
Try transferring auxiliary power to...

606
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,197
- secondary tank.
- Secondary tank.

607
00:51:25,222 --> 00:51:26,608
I got it.

608
00:51:27,277 --> 00:51:29,092
Chewie, come on!

609
00:51:30,144 --> 00:51:32,013
I need help with
this giant hairy thing!

610
00:51:32,038 --> 00:51:33,790
- Coming.
- Stop moving!

611
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:34,877
Ahhh!

612
00:51:34,902 --> 00:51:36,807
- Chewie!
- He needs help.

613
00:51:36,832 --> 00:51:38,894
You hurt Chewie,
you're going to deal with me!

614
00:51:38,919 --> 00:51:42,017
Hurt him?
He almost kill me six times!

615
00:51:42,194 --> 00:51:43,419
Which is fine.

616
00:51:43,444 --> 00:51:44,695
If this hyperdrive blows,

617
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,851
there's going to be pieces
of us in three different systems.

618
00:51:50,724 --> 00:51:52,343
What did you do?

619
00:51:52,368 --> 00:51:54,883
I bypass the compressor.

620
00:51:57,002 --> 00:51:58,316
Huh.

621
00:52:00,844 --> 00:52:02,670
Move, ball.

622
00:52:05,013 --> 00:52:08,972
Don't say that.
You did great, just rest.

623
00:52:08,997 --> 00:52:10,918
Good job, kid.

624
00:52:10,943 --> 00:52:12,151
Thanks.

625
00:52:12,176 --> 00:52:13,597
You're welcome.

626
00:52:18,184 --> 00:52:19,723
So.

627
00:52:19,748 --> 00:52:21,879
Fugitive, huh?

628
00:52:22,882 --> 00:52:24,357
The First Order wants the map.

629
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:26,355
Finn is with the Resistance.

630
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,393
I'm just a scavenger.

631
00:52:30,034 --> 00:52:31,575
Let's see what you got.

632
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,790
- Should I?
- Go ahead.

633
00:52:43,701 --> 00:52:47,040
This map is not complete,
it's just a piece.

634
00:52:47,615 --> 00:52:51,543
Ever since Luke disappeared
people'd been looking for him.

635
00:52:51,758 --> 00:52:53,535
Why did he leave?

636
00:52:54,406 --> 00:52:57,370
He was training a
new generation of Jedi.

637
00:52:57,395 --> 00:53:01,819
One boy, an apprentice,
turned against him, destroyed it all.

638
00:53:02,886 --> 00:53:04,773
Luke felt responsible.

639
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:08,083
He just walked away
from everything.

640
00:53:08,108 --> 00:53:09,766
Do you know what happened to him?

641
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:12,936
A lot of rumors, stories.

642
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:16,475
People who'd knew him best,

643
00:53:17,831 --> 00:53:21,185
think he went looking for
the first Jedi Temple.

644
00:53:21,915 --> 00:53:23,238
The Jedi were real?

645
00:53:23,263 --> 00:53:25,584
I used to wonder
about that myself.

646
00:53:25,609 --> 00:53:28,472
I thought it was a bunch
of mumbo jumbo.

647
00:53:28,743 --> 00:53:31,420
A magical power holding
together good and evil,

648
00:53:31,445 --> 00:53:33,723
the Dark side and the Light.

649
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,874
The crazy thing is...

650
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,516
It's true.

651
00:53:43,344 --> 00:53:45,677
The Force, the Jedi.

652
00:53:47,897 --> 00:53:49,517
All of it.

653
00:53:51,777 --> 00:53:53,783
It's all true.

654
00:53:57,458 --> 00:53:59,548
No, you rest.

655
00:53:59,638 --> 00:54:01,536
You want my help?
You're getting it.

656
00:54:01,561 --> 00:54:04,671
Going to see an old friend.
She'll get your droid home.

657
00:54:04,933 --> 00:54:06,567
This is our stop.

658
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,247
I didn't know there was this
much green in the whole galaxy.

659
00:54:54,408 --> 00:54:56,587
Hey, Solo, I'm not sure
what we're walking into here.

660
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:58,319
Did you just call me Solo?

661
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,069
Sorry, Han. Mr. Solo.

662
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:03,577
You should know,
I'm a big deal in the Resistance,

663
00:55:03,578 --> 00:55:05,989
which puts a real target
on my back.

664
00:55:06,014 --> 00:55:09,975
Are there any conspirators here?
Like First Order sympathizers?

665
00:55:09,976 --> 00:55:14,277
Listen, "big deal".
You have another problem.

666
00:55:14,482 --> 00:55:17,268
Women always figure out the truth.

667
00:55:18,317 --> 00:55:19,995
Always.

668
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:27,510
You might need this.

669
00:55:28,308 --> 00:55:30,082
I think I can handle myself.

670
00:55:30,107 --> 00:55:32,775
I know you do.
That's why I'm giving it to you.

671
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,247
Take it.

672
00:55:36,054 --> 00:55:37,389
You know how to use
one of those?

673
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:39,174
Yeah.
You pull the trigger.

674
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:41,579
A little bit more
truer than that.

675
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:43,540
You got a lot to learn.

676
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:46,333
You got a name?

677
00:55:46,664 --> 00:55:48,112
Rey.

678
00:55:48,426 --> 00:55:49,994
Rey.

679
00:55:53,311 --> 00:55:55,756
I've been thinking about
bringing on some more crew, Rey.

680
00:55:55,757 --> 00:55:57,730
A second mate.
Someone to help out.

681
00:55:57,731 --> 00:56:01,119
Someone who can keep up with Chewie
and me, who appreciates the Falcon.

682
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,933
Are you offering me a job?

683
00:56:02,934 --> 00:56:05,826
I wouldn't be nice to you.
I don't pay much.

684
00:56:05,851 --> 00:56:07,764
You're offering me a job?

685
00:56:08,769 --> 00:56:10,926
I'm thinking about it.

686
00:56:13,963 --> 00:56:15,438
Well?

687
00:56:19,512 --> 00:56:23,065
If you are, I'd be flattered.
But I have to go home.

688
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:24,969
Where?
Jakku?

689
00:56:24,994 --> 00:56:27,106
I've already been away too long.

690
00:56:28,758 --> 00:56:32,019
Chewie, checkout the ship
as best you can.

691
00:56:34,797 --> 00:56:38,265
It's too bad.
Chewie kinda likes you.

692
00:56:41,009 --> 00:56:42,616
Solo, why are we here again?

693
00:56:42,641 --> 00:56:45,184
- To get your droid on a clean ship.
- Clean?

694
00:56:45,209 --> 00:56:48,504
Do you think it was luck that
Chewie and I found the Falcon?

695
00:56:48,529 --> 00:56:52,800
If we can find it on our scanners,
the First Order is not far behind.

696
00:56:52,801 --> 00:56:55,531
You want to get BB-8
to the Resistance.

697
00:56:55,556 --> 00:56:58,543
Maz Kanata is our best bet.

698
00:56:58,568 --> 00:57:00,189
We can trust her, right?

699
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:01,744
Relax, kid.

700
00:57:01,769 --> 00:57:05,155
She's run this watering hole
for a thousand years.

701
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:08,819
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste,
so, let me do the talking.

702
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:10,619
And whatever you do, don't stare.

703
00:57:10,644 --> 00:57:12,074
- At what?
- At what?

704
00:57:12,631 --> 00:57:14,267
Any of it.

705
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:37,589
Han Solo!

706
00:57:41,286 --> 00:57:42,560
Oh, boy

707
00:57:42,585 --> 00:57:44,358
Hey, Maz.

708
00:57:47,477 --> 00:57:49,509
Where's my boyfriend?

709
00:57:49,831 --> 00:57:53,254
- Chewie's working in the Falcon.
- I like that Wookiee.

710
00:57:53,279 --> 00:57:56,945
I assume you need something.
Desperately.

711
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:58,854
Let's get to it.

712
00:58:06,522 --> 00:58:08,556
I'll be back.

713
00:58:23,387 --> 00:58:25,717
 Resistance spotted...

714
00:58:25,742 --> 00:58:29,004
and your lost droid is here too.

715
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:36,662
Inform the First Order...
I found the droid.

716
00:58:52,369 --> 00:58:54,037
Forgive me.

717
00:58:56,539 --> 00:58:58,702
I feel it again.

718
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:03,865
The pull to the light.

719
00:59:06,172 --> 00:59:08,938
The Supreme Commander senses it.

720
00:59:09,814 --> 00:59:11,596
Show me again.

721
00:59:11,621 --> 00:59:14,169
The power of the darkness.

722
00:59:15,127 --> 00:59:17,922
And I will let nothing
stand in our way.

723
00:59:18,735 --> 00:59:20,454
Show me...

724
00:59:22,284 --> 00:59:24,211
... Grandfather.

725
00:59:26,049 --> 00:59:30,483
And I will finish
what you started.

726
00:59:43,142 --> 00:59:44,602
A map...

727
00:59:44,627 --> 00:59:46,884
to Skywalker himself?

728
00:59:46,909 --> 00:59:50,167
I need you to
get this droid to Leia.

729
00:59:51,762 --> 00:59:53,243
No.

730
00:59:53,915 --> 00:59:58,194
You've been running away
from this fight for too long.

731
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:59,672
Han.

732
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:04,232
Go home.

733
01:00:04,265 --> 01:00:05,688
Leia doesn't want to see me.

734
01:00:05,713 --> 01:00:08,543
Please, we came here for your help.

735
01:00:09,197 --> 01:00:10,960
What fight?

736
01:00:11,132 --> 01:00:13,310
The only fight

737
01:00:13,335 --> 01:00:15,568
against the dark side.

738
01:00:15,593 --> 01:00:20,258
Through the ages,
I've seen evil take many forms.

739
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,604
The Sith.
The Empire.

740
01:00:22,629 --> 01:00:26,432
Today, it is the First Order.

741
01:00:26,457 --> 01:00:29,635
Their shadows spreading across the galaxy.

742
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,438
We must face them.

743
01:00:31,463 --> 01:00:33,643
Fight them.

744
01:00:33,668 --> 01:00:35,290
All of us.

745
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:37,292
There is no fighting
against the First Order.

746
01:00:37,317 --> 01:00:39,175
Not one we can win.

747
01:00:39,336 --> 01:00:40,888
Look around.

748
01:00:40,913 --> 01:00:43,260
There's no chance we haven't
been recognized us already.

749
01:00:43,285 --> 01:00:46,152
I bet you the First Order
is on their way right...

750
01:00:46,981 --> 01:00:48,411
What's this?

751
01:00:49,752 --> 01:00:51,240
What are you doing?

752
01:00:55,684 --> 01:00:57,241
Solo, what is she doing?

753
01:00:57,242 --> 01:00:59,214
I don't know,
but it ain't good.

754
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:04,857
If you live long enough, you see
the same eyes in different people.

755
01:01:05,152 --> 01:01:09,998
I'm looking at the eyes of a man
who wants to run.

756
01:01:12,746 --> 01:01:15,143
You don't know a thing about me.

757
01:01:16,086 --> 01:01:19,451
Where I'm from.
What I've seen.

758
01:01:19,732 --> 01:01:22,682
You don't know the
First Order like I do.

759
01:01:23,084 --> 01:01:25,173
They will slaughter us.

760
01:01:25,438 --> 01:01:27,734
We all need to run.

761
01:01:28,646 --> 01:01:29,835
Hm.

762
01:01:36,097 --> 01:01:37,579
You see those two?

763
01:01:37,604 --> 01:01:40,936
They'll trade work for 
transportation to the Outer Rim.

764
01:01:40,961 --> 01:01:43,697
There, you can disappear.

765
01:01:43,722 --> 01:01:45,124
Finn?

766
01:01:46,589 --> 01:01:48,319
Come with me.

767
01:01:48,686 --> 01:01:50,959
What about BB-8?
We're not done yet.

768
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,989
We have to get him
back to your base.

769
01:01:53,014 --> 01:01:55,757
You think?
He can't.

770
01:01:57,504 --> 01:01:59,215
I can't.

771
01:02:07,704 --> 01:02:09,447
Keep it, kid.

772
01:02:19,095 --> 01:02:21,135
Who's the girl?

773
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:25,436
- What? What is it?
- Let him speak first.

774
01:02:25,461 --> 01:02:27,834
I was told you can get me
to the Outer Rim.

775
01:02:27,859 --> 01:02:29,500
What are you doing?

776
01:02:30,548 --> 01:02:32,321
Don't leave without me.

777
01:02:35,299 --> 01:02:37,097
You can't just go.
I won't let you.

778
01:02:37,098 --> 01:02:38,370
I'm not who you think I am.

779
01:02:38,395 --> 01:02:41,288
- Finn, what are you talking about?
- I'm not Resistance.

780
01:02:41,313 --> 01:02:43,075
I'm not a hero.

781
01:02:45,796 --> 01:02:47,930
I'm a Stormtrooper.

782
01:02:48,885 --> 01:02:52,652
Like all of them, I was taken
from my family I'll never know.

783
01:02:52,677 --> 01:02:55,123
And raised to do one thing.

784
01:02:55,477 --> 01:02:58,811
In my first battle,
I made a choice.

785
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:01,936
I wasn't going to kill for them.

786
01:03:02,084 --> 01:03:05,202
So I ran,
right into you.

787
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:09,455
You looked at me
like no one ever had.

788
01:03:11,694 --> 01:03:14,034
I was ashamed of what I was.

789
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:18,653
But, I'm done with the First Order.

790
01:03:18,654 --> 01:03:20,726
I'm never going back.

791
01:03:22,361 --> 01:03:25,022
Rey, come with me.

792
01:03:25,222 --> 01:03:26,906
Don't go.

793
01:03:31,709 --> 01:03:33,961
Take care of yourself.

794
01:03:35,299 --> 01:03:36,799
Please.

795
01:03:50,747 --> 01:03:52,475
No!

796
01:03:52,835 --> 01:03:55,865
No!

797
01:04:07,798 --> 01:04:11,639
No!
Come back!

798
01:04:12,039 --> 01:04:14,130
No!

799
01:04:27,299 --> 01:04:29,352
Come back!

800
01:04:30,456 --> 01:04:32,815
Come back!

801
01:04:42,392 --> 01:04:44,414
No!

802
01:05:34,756 --> 01:05:36,568
No!

803
01:05:36,888 --> 01:05:38,528
His energy...

804
01:06:04,846 --> 01:06:06,348
No!

805
01:06:06,349 --> 01:06:08,677
Come back!

806
01:06:08,702 --> 01:06:10,547
Quiet, girl.

807
01:06:11,246 --> 01:06:12,853
No!

808
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:17,670
Rey?

809
01:06:21,622 --> 01:06:25,420
These are your first steps.

810
01:06:29,628 --> 01:06:31,195
What was that?

811
01:06:32,874 --> 01:06:34,868
I shouldn't gone in here.

812
01:06:36,615 --> 01:06:39,446
That lightsaber was Luke's.

813
01:06:39,471 --> 01:06:41,218
And his father's before him.

814
01:06:41,243 --> 01:06:44,849
And now, it call's to you.

815
01:06:44,874 --> 01:06:47,010
I have to get back to Jakku.

816
01:06:47,035 --> 01:06:49,007
Han told me.

817
01:06:56,345 --> 01:07:00,684
Dear child, I see your eyes.

818
01:07:00,709 --> 01:07:03,584
You already know the truth.

819
01:07:03,775 --> 01:07:06,813
Whoever you're waiting for in Jakku.

820
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:10,276
They're never coming back.

821
01:07:15,525 --> 01:07:20,008
But, there's someone who still could.

822
01:07:21,968 --> 01:07:23,591
Luke.

823
01:07:23,616 --> 01:07:27,339
The belonging you seek
is not behind you,

824
01:07:27,364 --> 01:07:29,122
it is ahead.

825
01:07:29,147 --> 01:07:32,868
I'm no Jedi, 
but I know the Force.

826
01:07:32,893 --> 01:07:38,148
It moves through and
surrounds every living thing.

827
01:07:38,795 --> 01:07:41,546
Close your eyes.

828
01:07:42,703 --> 01:07:44,609
Feel it .

829
01:07:44,984 --> 01:07:47,297
The light...

830
01:07:47,298 --> 01:07:49,768
it's always been there.

831
01:07:49,793 --> 01:07:52,198
It will guide you.

832
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:56,870
The saber.
Take it.

833
01:07:59,926 --> 01:08:01,979
I'm never touching
that thing again.

834
01:08:02,004 --> 01:08:04,494
I don't want any part of this.

835
01:08:29,779 --> 01:08:34,493
Today is the end of the Republic.

836
01:08:35,414 --> 01:08:41,289
The end of a regime
that acquiesces to disorder.

837
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:46,255
At this very moment
in a system far from here,

838
01:08:46,256 --> 01:08:51,133
the New Republic lies to the galaxy

839
01:08:51,158 --> 01:08:59,145
while secretly supporting the treachery
of the rogues of the Resistance.

840
01:08:59,154 --> 01:09:02,504
This fierce machine
which you have built,

841
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:07,264
upon which we stand
will bring an end to the Senate,

842
01:09:07,265 --> 01:09:09,890
to their cherished fleet.

843
01:09:09,891 --> 01:09:14,525
All remaining systems will bow
to the First Order!

844
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:17,094
and will remember this

845
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:22,127
as the last day of the Republic!

846
01:09:23,971 --> 01:09:26,453
Confirm transfer to manual control.

847
01:09:26,478 --> 01:09:28,136
Configure !

848
01:09:28,161 --> 01:09:30,144
Fire!

849
01:10:16,164 --> 01:10:21,454
*Hosnian System*

850
01:10:23,442 --> 01:10:28,421
* New Republic *

851
01:10:29,296 --> 01:10:31,624
Oh.
What is it?

852
01:10:48,029 --> 01:10:50,012
That was New Republic.

853
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:52,461
The First Order, they've done it.

854
01:10:54,346 --> 01:10:55,903
Where's Rey?

855
01:11:10,331 --> 01:11:12,768
Mistress, are you alright?

856
01:11:12,793 --> 01:11:14,223
What are you doing?

857
01:11:14,248 --> 01:11:16,004
I see you running,
are you alright?

858
01:11:16,029 --> 01:11:17,441
You have to go back.

859
01:11:17,466 --> 01:11:19,949
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.

860
01:11:20,299 --> 01:11:21,806
- BB-8...
- No.

861
01:11:21,831 --> 01:11:25,177
No, you can't. You have to go back,
you're too important.

862
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:27,103
They'll help you.

863
01:11:41,019 --> 01:11:43,083
I had this for ages.

864
01:11:46,037 --> 01:11:48,174
I kept it locked away.

865
01:11:48,199 --> 01:11:50,032
Where'd you get that?

866
01:11:50,484 --> 01:11:54,106
A good question,
for another time.

867
01:11:54,479 --> 01:11:57,953
Take it.
Find your friend!

868
01:12:04,383 --> 01:12:08,342
Those beasts.
They're here.

869
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:34,489
FN-417, hold position.

870
01:12:36,349 --> 01:12:37,975
Oh, safety.

871
01:12:44,667 --> 01:12:46,237
Wow!

872
01:13:03,273 --> 01:13:04,325
Sir.

873
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:07,584
The droid was spotted heading west.
With a girl.

874
01:13:12,226 --> 01:13:14,848
You have to keep going,
stay out of sight.

875
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:17,696
- I'll try to fight them off.
- I hope they wont find us.

876
01:13:17,721 --> 01:13:19,355
I hope so too.

877
01:13:31,399 --> 01:13:33,370
Come on, Chewie!

878
01:13:35,853 --> 01:13:39,236
Rey and BB-8! They need you!
Now! Go!

879
01:13:39,261 --> 01:13:41,247
I need a weapon!

880
01:13:41,272 --> 01:13:43,344
You have one!

881
01:13:52,202 --> 01:13:54,903
Hey.
Can I try that?

882
01:14:01,325 --> 01:14:03,485
I like this thing.

883
01:14:08,927 --> 01:14:10,392
Traitor!

884
01:14:54,595 --> 01:14:56,880
- You okay, "Big deal"?
- Thanks.

885
01:14:56,905 --> 01:14:58,346
Don't move!

886
01:14:58,889 --> 01:15:02,056
TK-338, we have targets in custody.

887
01:15:07,205 --> 01:15:09,578
We have incoming in 28.6.

888
01:15:09,579 --> 01:15:12,152
Move! Move!
Move! Move!

889
01:15:12,177 --> 01:15:15,267
Scramble all squads!
Repeat, scramble all squads!

890
01:15:15,292 --> 01:15:18,269
Take cover and
cover our mid field position!

891
01:15:19,876 --> 01:15:21,873
It's the Resistance.

892
01:15:29,495 --> 01:15:31,937
Go straight ahead at them!
Don't let these thugs scare you!

893
01:15:31,938 --> 01:15:34,102
- Copy that.
- We're with you, Poe.

894
01:16:02,121 --> 01:16:03,461
Quick!

895
01:16:32,169 --> 01:16:34,007
Yeah!

896
01:16:34,032 --> 01:16:36,454
That's one hell of a pilot!

897
01:17:31,444 --> 01:17:34,044
The girl I heard so much about.

898
01:17:45,776 --> 01:17:47,307
The droid.

899
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,366
Where is it?

900
01:17:56,432 --> 01:17:58,408
We're going to need air support.

901
01:18:05,348 --> 01:18:07,150
The map.

902
01:18:08,635 --> 01:18:10,408
You've seen it.

903
01:18:10,734 --> 01:18:13,718
Sir, Resistance fighters.

904
01:18:14,078 --> 01:18:15,613
We need more troops.

905
01:18:15,638 --> 01:18:17,533
Pull the division out.

906
01:18:17,711 --> 01:18:21,343
Forget the droid.
We have what we need.

907
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:29,655
Fall back!

908
01:18:44,287 --> 01:18:45,587
No!

909
01:18:49,309 --> 01:18:51,527
No!
No, no!

910
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:56,025
No!
No!

911
01:18:56,561 --> 01:18:58,999
Rey!

912
01:19:16,801 --> 01:19:19,397
He took her.
Did you see it?

913
01:19:19,634 --> 01:19:21,072
He took her.
She's gone.

914
01:19:21,097 --> 01:19:23,048
Yeah, yeah, I know.

915
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:33,217
Come on.

916
01:19:46,603 --> 01:19:47,763
Goodness!

917
01:19:47,788 --> 01:19:51,747
Han Solo!
It is I, C-3PO.

918
01:19:51,748 --> 01:19:54,946
You probably don't recognize me
because of the red arm.

919
01:19:54,971 --> 01:19:57,669
Look who it is!
Did you see who...?

920
01:19:57,694 --> 01:20:00,129
Oh.
Eh.

921
01:20:01,703 --> 01:20:04,650
Excuse me, Princess... General.
I'm sorry.

922
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:07,088
- Come on, BB-8, they're waiting.
- What an unusual arm you have.

923
01:20:07,113 --> 01:20:10,358
Yes, I must have
my proper arm reinstall.

924
01:20:11,737 --> 01:20:13,632
You changed your hair.

925
01:20:15,758 --> 01:20:17,629
Same jacket.

926
01:20:18,497 --> 01:20:20,804
No, new jacket.

927
01:20:33,322 --> 01:20:34,951
I saw him.

928
01:20:35,945 --> 01:20:38,464
Leia, I saw our son.

929
01:20:39,976 --> 01:20:41,675
He was here.

930
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:23,610
Hey!

931
01:21:25,436 --> 01:21:26,782
Poe!

932
01:21:27,652 --> 01:21:29,358
BB-8, my friend.

933
01:21:29,383 --> 01:21:31,683
Good to see you.

934
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:33,128
Finn saved you?
Where is he?

935
01:21:33,153 --> 01:21:34,166
There.

936
01:21:34,191 --> 01:21:35,417
Poe.

937
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:39,677
Poe Dameron, you're alive?

938
01:21:39,702 --> 01:21:40,862
Why...

939
01:21:40,863 --> 01:21:42,183
- so are you!
- What happened?

940
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:45,520
What happened, I was throw from the crash.
I woke up at night; no you, no ship, nothing

941
01:21:45,521 --> 01:21:48,285
- BB-8 says that you saved him.
- No, no, no. It wasn't just me.

942
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:51,589
You completed my mission, Finn...
That's my jacket.

943
01:21:51,614 --> 01:21:53,988
- Oh.
- No no no...

944
01:21:54,013 --> 01:21:56,080
Keep it.
It suits you.

945
01:21:56,573 --> 01:21:58,504
You're a good man, Finn.

946
01:21:59,303 --> 01:22:01,623
Poe, I need your help.

947
01:22:02,628 --> 01:22:05,947
PZ-4CO, report to communications.

948
01:22:08,876 --> 01:22:10,687
General Organa.

949
01:22:11,505 --> 01:22:13,637
I'm sorry to interrupt.
This is Finn.

950
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:16,620
- He needs to talk to you.
- And I need to talk to him.

951
01:22:16,645 --> 01:22:18,530
That was incredibly brave,
 what you did.

952
01:22:18,555 --> 01:22:20,959
Renouncing the First Order,
saving this man's life.

953
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,008
Thank you, ma'am. But a friend
of mine was taken prisoner.

954
01:22:23,033 --> 01:22:25,032
Han told me about the girl.

955
01:22:25,057 --> 01:22:26,192
I'm sorry.

956
01:22:26,193 --> 01:22:28,575
Finn's familiar with the weapon that
destroyed the Hosnian system,

957
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:30,095
he worked on the base.

958
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,918
We're just good for
anything you can tell us.

959
01:22:31,943 --> 01:22:34,527
That's where my friend was taken.
I got to get there fast.

960
01:22:34,552 --> 01:22:36,659
And I will do everything
I can to help, but first

961
01:22:36,684 --> 01:22:39,097
you need to tell us
all you know.

962
01:22:41,611 --> 01:22:44,109
That sounds very scary.

963
01:22:45,451 --> 01:22:48,469
You must be so brave.

964
01:22:50,626 --> 01:22:52,972
General, I regret to
inform you but

965
01:22:52,997 --> 01:22:56,258
this map recovered from BB-8
is only partially complete.

966
01:22:56,283 --> 01:23:00,076
And even worse, it matches
no charted system on record.

967
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:04,453
We simply do not have enough
information to locate Master Luke.

968
01:23:04,478 --> 01:23:08,125
We are so foolish to think I could
find Luke and bring him home.

969
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:09,265
Leia.

970
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:10,537
Don't do that.

971
01:23:10,538 --> 01:23:11,548
Do what?

972
01:23:11,573 --> 01:23:13,234
Anything.

973
01:23:14,195 --> 01:23:15,803
Princesses.

974
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:18,899
I'm trying to be helpful.

975
01:23:18,924 --> 01:23:22,293
When did that ever help?
And don't say the Death Star.

976
01:23:29,060 --> 01:23:31,499
R2, I need your help.

977
01:23:36,101 --> 01:23:37,268
Wake up, R2.

978
01:23:37,293 --> 01:23:40,016
BB-8.
You're wasting your time.

979
01:23:40,041 --> 01:23:41,081
He might have the map.

980
01:23:41,106 --> 01:23:44,740
It is very doubtful that R2 would have the
rest of the map in his backup data.

981
01:23:44,765 --> 01:23:46,658
- Can't we wake him?
- I am afraid not.

982
01:23:46,659 --> 01:23:51,325
R2-D2 has been in low power mode
ever since Master Luke went away.

983
01:23:53,355 --> 01:23:57,042
Sadly, he may never
be his own self again.

984
01:23:57,184 --> 01:23:58,353
Poor R2.

985
01:23:58,378 --> 01:24:00,042
Listen to me, will you?

986
01:24:01,138 --> 01:24:03,210
I know every time you...

987
01:24:05,613 --> 01:24:07,921
Every time you look me,
you're reminded of him.

988
01:24:07,922 --> 01:24:10,163
Do you think
I want to forget him?

989
01:24:10,188 --> 01:24:11,912
I want him back.

990
01:24:11,937 --> 01:24:14,314
There's nothing more
we could have done

991
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,172
There's too much Vader in him.

992
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:20,098
That's why I wanted him
to be trained with Luke.

993
01:24:20,322 --> 01:24:23,792
I just never should had sent
him away, that’s when I lost him.

994
01:24:24,656 --> 01:24:27,014
That's when I lost you both.

995
01:24:28,904 --> 01:24:32,433
We both had to deal with it
in our own way.

996
01:24:32,594 --> 01:24:35,910
I went back to the only thing
I was only good at.

997
01:24:36,052 --> 01:24:37,802
We both did.

998
01:24:39,542 --> 01:24:42,725
We lost our son.
Forever.

999
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:43,938
No.

1000
01:24:43,963 --> 01:24:45,504
It was Snoke.

1001
01:24:45,529 --> 01:24:48,276
He seduced our son
to the dark side.

1002
01:24:48,301 --> 01:24:50,802
But we can still save him.

1003
01:24:50,827 --> 01:24:52,397
Me.

1004
01:24:53,156 --> 01:24:54,456
You.

1005
01:24:54,493 --> 01:24:57,112
If Luke couldn't reach him,
how could I?

1006
01:24:57,137 --> 01:24:59,218
Luke is a Jedi.

1007
01:25:00,105 --> 01:25:02,080
You're his father.

1008
01:25:04,205 --> 01:25:07,834
There's still light in him,
I know it.

1009
01:25:07,859 --> 01:25:09,481
General.

1010
01:25:09,506 --> 01:25:13,126
The reconnaissance report
on the enemy base is coming.

1011
01:25:39,135 --> 01:25:40,706
Where am I?

1012
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,987
You're my guest.

1013
01:25:43,988 --> 01:25:45,159
Where are the others?

1014
01:25:45,184 --> 01:25:50,766
Do you mean the murderers, traitors 
and thieves, you called friends?

1015
01:25:50,973 --> 01:25:53,907
You'll be relieved to hear
I have no idea.

1016
01:25:55,622 --> 01:25:57,982
You still want to kill me.

1017
01:25:58,174 --> 01:26:01,946
That happens when you're being 
haunting by a contort mask.

1018
01:26:26,847 --> 01:26:28,771
Tell me about the droid.

1019
01:26:29,552 --> 01:26:32,897
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive 
and a thermal hyperscan vindicator...

1020
01:26:32,922 --> 01:26:35,099
Carrying a section of a navigation chart.

1021
01:26:35,124 --> 01:26:36,611
We have the rest.

1022
01:26:36,636 --> 01:26:39,468
Recovered from the archives of the Empire,
but we need the last piece.

1023
01:26:39,493 --> 01:26:42,418
Yet somehow you convinced 
the droid to show it to you.

1024
01:26:43,482 --> 01:26:45,038
You,

1025
01:26:45,986 --> 01:26:47,770
a scavenger.

1026
01:26:49,495 --> 01:26:51,889
You know I can take 
whatever I want.

1027
01:26:57,836 --> 01:26:59,870
You're so lonely.

1028
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:03,633
So afraid to leave.

1029
01:27:07,578 --> 01:27:10,849
At night, desperate to sleep.

1030
01:27:13,532 --> 01:27:15,442
Imagine an ocean.

1031
01:27:16,106 --> 01:27:17,673
I see it.

1032
01:27:18,588 --> 01:27:20,787
I see the island.

1033
01:27:24,972 --> 01:27:26,829
And Han Solo.

1034
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:30,894
You feel like he's a father 
you never had.

1035
01:27:31,323 --> 01:27:32,572
He would have disappointed you.

1036
01:27:32,597 --> 01:27:34,759
Get out of my head!

1037
01:27:35,288 --> 01:27:37,306
I know you've seen the map.

1038
01:27:38,524 --> 01:27:40,012
It's in there.

1039
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:42,584
And now you'll give it to me.

1040
01:27:50,357 --> 01:27:52,849
Don't be afraid.
I feel it too.

1041
01:27:54,963 --> 01:27:57,546
I'm not giving you anything.

1042
01:27:58,068 --> 01:27:59,459
We'll see.

1043
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:40,799
You...

1044
01:28:41,132 --> 01:28:42,907
you're afraid...

1045
01:28:45,196 --> 01:28:49,016
that you will never be 
as strong as Darth Vader!

1046
01:28:57,099 --> 01:28:59,414
This scavenger

1047
01:28:59,439 --> 01:29:00,803
resisted you!

1048
01:29:00,834 --> 01:29:02,553
She is strong with the Force.

1049
01:29:02,578 --> 01:29:04,458
Untrained, but stronger than she knows.

1050
01:29:04,459 --> 01:29:05,746
And the droid?

1051
01:29:05,771 --> 01:29:09,086
Ren believed it was 
no longer valuable to us.

1052
01:29:09,111 --> 01:29:12,186
That the girl, 
is all we needed.

1053
01:29:12,187 --> 01:29:15,740
As a result, the Droid is most likely been 
returned to the hands of the enemy.

1054
01:29:15,765 --> 01:29:17,396
They may have the map already.

1055
01:29:17,421 --> 01:29:21,402
Then the Resistance must be destroyed
before they get to Skywalker.

1056
01:29:21,427 --> 01:29:23,254
We have their location.

1057
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:26,645
We tracked their reconnaissance 
team to the Ileenium System.

1058
01:29:26,799 --> 01:29:28,294
Good.

1059
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:31,449
Then we will crash them 
once and for all.

1060
01:29:31,474 --> 01:29:33,719
Prepare the weapon.

1061
01:29:33,744 --> 01:29:36,306
Supreme Leader, I can get 
the map from the girl.

1062
01:29:36,307 --> 01:29:38,924
I just need your guidance.

1063
01:29:39,806 --> 01:29:44,570
If what you say 
about this girl is true...

1064
01:29:44,595 --> 01:29:49,738
Bring her to me.

1065
01:30:03,215 --> 01:30:05,410
You will remove these restraints

1066
01:30:05,435 --> 01:30:09,288
and leave this cell
with the door open.

1067
01:30:12,349 --> 01:30:14,128
What did you say?

1068
01:30:16,936 --> 01:30:18,456
You will remove these restraints

1069
01:30:18,481 --> 01:30:21,705
and leave this cell
with the door open.

1070
01:30:28,076 --> 01:30:30,004
I will tighten those restraints,

1071
01:30:30,029 --> 01:30:32,386
scavenger scum!

1072
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:47,640
You will remove these restraints

1073
01:30:47,665 --> 01:30:50,702
and leave this cell
with the door open.

1074
01:30:53,817 --> 01:30:55,284
I will remove these restraints

1075
01:30:55,309 --> 01:30:57,952
and leave this cell
with the door open.

1076
01:31:06,102 --> 01:31:07,515
And you'll drop your gun.

1077
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:09,938
And I'll drop my gun.

1078
01:31:24,123 --> 01:31:25,423
No.

1079
01:31:26,861 --> 01:31:28,814
Guards!

1080
01:31:30,649 --> 01:31:32,757
Guards!

1081
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:38,933
Begin charging the weapon.

1082
01:31:38,958 --> 01:31:42,045
Yes, sir. 
Weapon charging.

1083
01:32:00,675 --> 01:32:04,233
The scan Data from Snap's reconnaissance
flight confirms Finn's report.

1084
01:32:04,258 --> 01:32:07,894
They somehow created a hyper lightspeed 
weapon built within the planet itself.

1085
01:32:07,919 --> 01:32:09,019
A laser cannon?

1086
01:32:09,044 --> 01:32:10,945
We're not sure how to describe 
a weapon of this scale.

1087
01:32:10,970 --> 01:32:12,249
It's another Death Star.

1088
01:32:12,274 --> 01:32:15,925
I wish that were the case, Major.
This was the Death Star.

1089
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:20,721
And this,
is Starkiller base.

1090
01:32:20,746 --> 01:32:21,950
So, it's big.

1091
01:32:21,975 --> 01:32:25,298
How is it possible to power up 
a weapon of that size?

1092
01:32:25,299 --> 01:32:28,085
They uses the power of the sun.

1093
01:32:28,652 --> 01:32:31,863
As the weapon is charge,
the sun is drained until it disappears.

1094
01:32:31,888 --> 01:32:33,137
Ma'am.

1095
01:32:34,874 --> 01:32:38,687
The First Order charging 
their weapon again, now.

1096
01:32:38,712 --> 01:32:40,568
Our system is the next charge.

1097
01:32:40,593 --> 01:32:43,248
Oh, my.
Without the Republic fleet, we're doom.

1098
01:32:43,273 --> 01:32:45,335
Okay.
How do we blow it up?

1099
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,552
- There is always a way to do that.
- Han's right.

1100
01:32:47,577 --> 01:32:50,186
In order for that amount 
of power to be contained,

1101
01:32:50,211 --> 01:32:52,713
that base has to have some kind 
of thermal oscillator.

1102
01:32:52,738 --> 01:32:55,519
There is one. 
Precinct 47.

1103
01:32:55,544 --> 01:32:56,802
Here.

1104
01:32:56,802 --> 01:32:58,989
If we can destroy that oscillator,

1105
01:32:59,014 --> 01:33:02,052
it might destabilize the core
and cripple the weapon.

1106
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:03,183
Maybe the planet.

1107
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:05,438
We'll go in there, we'll hit that 
oscillator with everything we got.

1108
01:33:05,463 --> 01:33:08,759
They have defensive shields that 
our ships cannot penetrate.

1109
01:33:08,784 --> 01:33:10,733
We disable the shields.

1110
01:33:10,758 --> 01:33:12,360
Kid, you worked there.

1111
01:33:12,361 --> 01:33:14,530
- What do you got?
- I can do it.

1112
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:15,769
I like this guy.

1113
01:33:15,794 --> 01:33:19,333
I can seal the shields, but I have 
to be there, on the planet.

1114
01:33:19,358 --> 01:33:21,617
- We'll get you there.
- Han, how?

1115
01:33:21,642 --> 01:33:23,652
If I told you, 
you wouldn't like it

1116
01:33:23,683 --> 01:33:25,101
So, we disable the shields,

1117
01:33:25,126 --> 01:33:28,416
we take out the oscillator 
and we blow up the big gun.

1118
01:33:29,093 --> 01:33:30,846
Alright, let's go!

1119
01:33:52,424 --> 01:33:55,589
Chewie, check that thermal capitator.
Come on, let's go!

1120
01:33:55,614 --> 01:33:57,966
Hey, be careful with those.
They're explosives.

1121
01:33:58,001 --> 01:33:59,099
Now, you tell me?

1122
01:33:59,124 --> 01:34:02,062
You know?
No matter how much we fought,

1123
01:34:03,367 --> 01:34:06,071
I always hated watching you leave.

1124
01:34:06,096 --> 01:34:07,919
That's why I did it

1125
01:34:08,739 --> 01:34:10,537
So you'd miss me.

1126
01:34:12,843 --> 01:34:14,554
I did miss you.

1127
01:34:16,114 --> 01:34:19,249
It wasn't all bad, was it?
Huh?

1128
01:34:19,355 --> 01:34:22,677
Some of it was... good.

1129
01:34:22,702 --> 01:34:24,187
Pretty good.

1130
01:34:27,426 --> 01:34:29,681
Some things never change.

1131
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:33,175
True.
You still drive me crazy.

1132
01:34:42,147 --> 01:34:44,340
If you see our son,

1133
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,138
bring him home.

1134
01:34:53,655 --> 01:34:57,970
Sir. Sensors triggered in Hanger 718.
We're searching the area.

1135
01:34:57,995 --> 01:35:00,149
She's just beginning 
to test her powers.

1136
01:35:00,150 --> 01:35:04,584
The longer it takes to find her,
the more dangerous she becomes.

1137
01:35:18,726 --> 01:35:20,188
How're we getting in?

1138
01:35:20,213 --> 01:35:22,211
Their shields have a 
fractional refresh rate.

1139
01:35:22,236 --> 01:35:25,863
It keeps anything traveling slower
than lightspeed from getting through.

1140
01:35:25,888 --> 01:35:28,777
We're making our landing 
approach at lightspeed?

1141
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:30,968
Chewie, get ready.

1142
01:35:31,677 --> 01:35:33,998
And... Now!

1143
01:35:37,292 --> 01:35:39,445
I am pulling up!

1144
01:35:45,881 --> 01:35:48,825
I get any higher, they'll see us!

1145
01:36:09,946 --> 01:36:13,780
Sir, she was not found in hanger 718,
but all troops are on alert.

1146
01:36:13,805 --> 01:36:15,266
Put every hanger on lockdown.

1147
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:18,167
She's going to try to
steal a ship to escape.

1148
01:36:19,602 --> 01:36:21,496
Han Solo.

1149
01:36:32,324 --> 01:36:34,169
The flooding tunnel 
is over that ridge.

1150
01:36:34,194 --> 01:36:35,538
We'll get in that way.

1151
01:36:35,563 --> 01:36:37,394
What was your job when 
you were based here?

1152
01:36:37,419 --> 01:36:39,082
Sanitation.

1153
01:36:41,011 --> 01:36:42,984
Sanitation?

1154
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:44,960
And how do you know
how to disable the shields?

1155
01:36:44,985 --> 01:36:47,805
I don't.
I'm just here to get Rey.

1156
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:51,719
People are counting on us.
The galaxy is counting on us.

1157
01:36:51,744 --> 01:36:53,872
Solo, we'll figure it out.

1158
01:36:53,897 --> 01:36:55,359
We'll use the force.

1159
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:57,767
That's not how the Force works.

1160
01:36:57,792 --> 01:36:59,075
I'm cold.

1161
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:01,391
Oh, really? 
You're cold?

1162
01:37:01,416 --> 01:37:02,772
Come on.

1163
01:37:10,415 --> 01:37:11,749
Report.

1164
01:37:11,774 --> 01:37:14,660
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.

1165
01:37:16,403 --> 01:37:17,748
Hey!

1166
01:37:20,569 --> 01:37:22,775
The longer we're here, 
the less luck we're going to have.

1167
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,997
- The shields.
- I have an idea about that.

1168
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:33,007
AH!

1169
01:37:33,032 --> 01:37:35,702
- Do you remember me?
- FN-2187

1170
01:37:35,727 --> 01:37:38,685
Not any more. The name's Finn 
and I'm in charge.

1171
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:40,766
I'm in charge now, Phasma.
I'm in charge.

1172
01:37:40,791 --> 01:37:42,830
- Bring it down. Bring it down.
- Okay.

1173
01:37:42,855 --> 01:37:44,529
Follow me.

1174
01:38:41,855 --> 01:38:44,979
You want me to blast that bucket 
off your head? Lower the shields.

1175
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:47,139
You're making a big mistake.

1176
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:48,513
Do it.

1177
01:38:53,468 --> 01:38:56,978
Solo, if this works, we're not going 
to have a lot of time to find Rey.

1178
01:38:57,003 --> 01:38:58,740
Don't worry, kid.

1179
01:38:59,196 --> 01:39:01,579
We won't leave here without her.

1180
01:39:02,312 --> 01:39:05,230
You can't be so stupid 
just to think this will be easy.

1181
01:39:05,231 --> 01:39:07,988
My troops will storm 
this block and kill you all.

1182
01:39:08,013 --> 01:39:10,357
I disagree. 
What do we do with her?

1183
01:39:10,382 --> 01:39:12,246
Is there a garage chute?

1184
01:39:12,730 --> 01:39:14,735
Trash compactor?

1185
01:39:15,004 --> 01:39:16,167
There is.

1186
01:39:16,192 --> 01:39:18,045
General, their shields are down.

1187
01:39:18,070 --> 01:39:19,637
Thank the maker!

1188
01:39:19,662 --> 01:39:21,606
Han did it!
Send them in.

1189
01:39:21,631 --> 01:39:23,628
Give Poe full authorization for attack.

1190
01:39:23,629 --> 01:39:25,890
Black leader,
go to sublight speed formation.

1191
01:39:25,915 --> 01:39:27,035
Roger, base.

1192
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:29,527
Red squad, Blue squad,
take my lead.

1193
01:39:29,670 --> 01:39:31,518
Dropping out of lightspeed.

1194
01:39:44,792 --> 01:39:46,269
Almost in range!

1195
01:39:46,270 --> 01:39:49,204
Hit the target dead center
as many runs as we can get.

1196
01:39:49,229 --> 01:39:50,959
Approaching target.

1197
01:39:55,070 --> 01:39:56,868
Fighters incoming!

1198
01:39:59,982 --> 01:40:01,070
Shields up!
Shields up!

1199
01:40:01,095 --> 01:40:02,778
Dispatch all squadrons.

1200
01:40:02,803 --> 01:40:04,376
Yes, General.

1201
01:40:04,829 --> 01:40:06,724
Alright, let's light it up!

1202
01:40:15,457 --> 01:40:16,799
Ha!
Direct hit!

1203
01:40:16,824 --> 01:40:17,920
But no damage.

1204
01:40:17,945 --> 01:40:19,462
Yeah, we got to keep hitting it.

1205
01:40:19,487 --> 01:40:20,770
Another bombing run.

1206
01:40:20,771 --> 01:40:23,687
Remember, when the sun is gone, 
their weapon will be ready to fire.

1207
01:40:23,688 --> 01:40:26,637
But as long as there is light,
we got a chance.

1208
01:40:26,885 --> 01:40:30,322
- Master Poe, enemy fighters!
- Guys, we got a lot of company!

1209
01:40:47,539 --> 01:40:49,660
We'll use the charges 
to blow that blast door.

1210
01:40:49,685 --> 01:40:52,362
I'm going in and draw fire
but I'm going to need you to cover.

1211
01:40:52,387 --> 01:40:53,749
You sure you are up for this?

1212
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:54,835
Hell, no.

1213
01:40:54,836 --> 01:40:57,749
I'll go in and try to find Rey.
The troopers will be on our tail.

1214
01:40:57,774 --> 01:40:59,694
We have to be ready for that.

1215
01:40:59,695 --> 01:41:01,685
Oh, there's an access tunnel 
that leads...

1216
01:41:01,686 --> 01:41:04,339
Why're you do that? Hm.
Why're you doing this?

1217
01:41:04,364 --> 01:41:06,207
I'm trying to 
come up with a plan.

1218
01:41:21,058 --> 01:41:22,280
- Ah!
- No!

1219
01:41:22,305 --> 01:41:23,873
Are you alright?

1220
01:41:23,898 --> 01:41:25,715
- Yeah.
- Good.

1221
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:27,361
What happened to you?
Did he hurt you?

1222
01:41:27,362 --> 01:41:30,588
- Finn, what are you doing here?
- We came to get you.

1223
01:41:31,755 --> 01:41:33,499
What did he say?

1224
01:41:33,524 --> 01:41:35,342
He says it was your idea.

1225
01:41:38,831 --> 01:41:40,551
Thank you.

1226
01:41:43,607 --> 01:41:45,381
How did you get away?

1227
01:41:45,406 --> 01:41:48,550
I can't explain it.
And you wouldn't believe it.

1228
01:41:48,591 --> 01:41:51,287
Escape now,
hug later

1229
01:42:06,107 --> 01:42:07,648
I got one behind me.

1230
01:42:07,673 --> 01:42:09,679
- You see it?
- Yeah. I'm on it.

1231
01:42:18,587 --> 01:42:20,547
Watch out for ground fire.

1232
01:42:24,590 --> 01:42:28,039
They're in trouble.
We can't leave.

1233
01:42:29,819 --> 01:42:32,765
My friend's got a bag 
full of explosives.

1234
01:42:33,173 --> 01:42:34,468
Let's use them.

1235
01:42:34,469 --> 01:42:36,143
General, are you seeing this?

1236
01:42:36,168 --> 01:42:39,401
Two more X-wing's down.
That's half our fleet destroyed.

1237
01:42:39,426 --> 01:42:42,489
And their weapon will be 
fully charged in 10 minutes.

1238
01:42:42,514 --> 01:42:45,425
It would take a miracle 
to save us now.

1239
01:43:12,073 --> 01:43:14,053
That girl knows her stuff.

1240
01:43:23,379 --> 01:43:26,518
Let's set the charges 
against every other column.

1241
01:43:27,579 --> 01:43:29,383
You're right.
That's a better idea.

1242
01:43:29,384 --> 01:43:31,484
You take the top.
I'll go down below.

1243
01:43:31,509 --> 01:43:33,163
Detonator.

1244
01:43:33,188 --> 01:43:35,144
We'll meet back here.

1245
01:44:20,435 --> 01:44:22,124
Find them.

1246
01:45:23,013 --> 01:45:24,479
Ben!

1247
01:45:36,584 --> 01:45:38,322
Han Solo.

1248
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:41,515
I've been waiting for 
this day for a long time.

1249
01:46:00,725 --> 01:46:04,383
Take off that mask. 
You don't need it.

1250
01:46:04,617 --> 01:46:06,781
What do you think 
you'll see if I do?

1251
01:46:06,806 --> 01:46:09,440
The face of my son.

1252
01:46:30,443 --> 01:46:33,325
Your son is gone.

1253
01:46:34,193 --> 01:46:37,051
He was weak and foolish 
like his father,

1254
01:46:37,076 --> 01:46:38,893
so I destroyed him.

1255
01:46:40,524 --> 01:46:43,393
That's what Snoke
wants you to believe,

1256
01:46:44,028 --> 01:46:46,013
but it's not true.

1257
01:46:47,307 --> 01:46:49,480
My son is alive.

1258
01:46:49,505 --> 01:46:50,872
No.

1259
01:46:50,897 --> 01:46:52,942
The Supreme Leader is wise.

1260
01:46:52,943 --> 01:46:55,842
Snoke is using you 
for your power.

1261
01:46:56,204 --> 01:46:59,212
When he gets what he wants, 
he'll crush you.

1262
01:47:03,288 --> 01:47:05,218
You know it's true.

1263
01:47:10,465 --> 01:47:11,686
It's too late.

1264
01:47:11,711 --> 01:47:15,794
No, it's not. 
Leave here with me. Come home.

1265
01:47:16,655 --> 01:47:18,495
We miss you.

1266
01:47:26,810 --> 01:47:29,003
I'm being torn apart.

1267
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:33,929
I want to be free 
of this pain.

1268
01:47:39,376 --> 01:47:40,856
I know what I have to
do but I don't know

1269
01:47:40,881 --> 01:47:42,993
if I have the strength to do it.

1270
01:47:46,556 --> 01:47:48,033
Will you help me?

1271
01:47:48,058 --> 01:47:50,433
Yes. 
Anything.

1272
01:48:17,165 --> 01:48:20,333
(The light!)

1273
01:48:40,070 --> 01:48:41,673
NO!!!

1274
01:48:47,472 --> 01:48:49,044
Thank you.

1275
01:50:12,456 --> 01:50:14,109
The oscillator's been damaged,

1276
01:50:14,110 --> 01:50:15,741
but it's still functional.

1277
01:50:15,742 --> 01:50:19,538
Admiral, their weapon 
will fire in two minutes.

1278
01:50:29,608 --> 01:50:31,420
The Falcon's this way.

1279
01:50:52,198 --> 01:50:54,011
We not done yet.

1280
01:50:56,690 --> 01:50:58,622
You're a monster!

1281
01:50:58,647 --> 01:51:00,735
It's just us now.

1282
01:51:01,634 --> 01:51:03,936
Han Solo can't save you.

1283
01:51:12,879 --> 01:51:14,486
Rey!

1284
01:51:16,034 --> 01:51:19,181
Hold on.
Rey. Rey.

1285
01:51:21,104 --> 01:51:23,776
Oh, no. 
No, no, no, no. Rey.

1286
01:51:26,161 --> 01:51:28,078
Traitor!

1287
01:51:37,953 --> 01:51:39,965
That lightsaber...

1288
01:51:40,687 --> 01:51:42,008
belongs to me.

1289
01:51:42,033 --> 01:51:43,637
Come and get it.

1290
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:32,869
We just lost Star-1.

1291
01:53:32,894 --> 01:53:34,122
We are overwhelmed.

1292
01:53:34,147 --> 01:53:36,319
What are we doing?
It isn't working.

1293
01:53:36,344 --> 01:53:39,033
Black Leader, there's a brand 
new hole in that oscillator.

1294
01:53:39,058 --> 01:53:41,280
Looks like our friends got in.

1295
01:53:41,891 --> 01:53:44,025
Red-4, Red-6, Cover us.

1296
01:53:44,026 --> 01:53:45,132
- I'm on it.
- Roger.

1297
01:53:45,157 --> 01:53:48,762
Everybody else, get your target on.
Give it everything you got.

1298
01:54:00,818 --> 01:54:02,263
I need some help here.
I need some help!

1299
01:54:02,264 --> 01:54:04,487
- Coming in.
- Watch out!

1300
01:54:04,627 --> 01:54:06,130
I'm hit!

1301
01:54:11,099 --> 01:54:12,178
All teams.

1302
01:54:12,179 --> 01:54:14,521
I'm going in. 
Pull up and cover me.

1303
01:54:14,522 --> 01:54:17,471
Copy that, Black leader.
Good luck, Poe.

1304
01:54:22,540 --> 01:54:25,552
The weapon will be fully 
charged in 30 seconds.

1305
01:54:25,762 --> 01:54:27,893
Prepare to fire.

1306
01:56:00,193 --> 01:56:02,040
You need a teacher!

1307
01:56:03,356 --> 01:56:05,944
I can show you 
the ways to the Force!

1308
01:56:07,705 --> 01:56:09,378
The Force.

1309
01:58:02,934 --> 01:58:04,909
Lieutenant! 
Get back to your station!

1310
01:58:04,934 --> 01:58:08,058
Just look! We won't survive,
even Hux is gone!

1311
01:58:08,059 --> 01:58:09,762
Supreme Leader.

1312
01:58:10,625 --> 01:58:12,911
The fuel cells erupted.

1313
01:58:12,935 --> 01:58:15,124
The collapse of the 
planet has begun.

1314
01:58:15,165 --> 01:58:19,872
Leave the base at once and 
come to me with Kylo Ren.

1315
01:58:20,257 --> 01:58:24,957
It's time to complete his training.

1316
01:58:27,255 --> 01:58:29,956
Finn. Finn!
Finn.

1317
01:58:52,718 --> 01:58:54,069
(Chewie.)

1318
01:59:19,027 --> 01:59:21,494
All teams,
I got eyes on them.

1319
01:59:21,519 --> 01:59:22,733
Yes!

1320
01:59:45,241 --> 01:59:48,422
Our job's done here.
Let's go home.

1321
02:00:03,451 --> 02:00:05,708
Easy. Easy.
He's hurt.

1322
02:00:05,830 --> 02:00:07,335
We got a heartbeat.

1323
02:00:59,275 --> 02:01:00,597
How are you?

1324
02:01:00,622 --> 02:01:02,160
You are awake!

1325
02:01:05,394 --> 02:01:07,107
R2-D2!

1326
02:01:07,132 --> 02:01:09,130
You've come back!

1327
02:01:11,985 --> 02:01:13,696
You found what?

1328
02:01:13,721 --> 02:01:15,860
How dare you call me that!

1329
02:01:16,375 --> 02:01:18,168
We have to find Master Luke.

1330
02:01:18,193 --> 02:01:20,407
- Find Master Luke, how?
- I have a map.

1331
02:01:20,432 --> 02:01:23,957
Come, R2, we must go 
tell the others at once!

1332
02:01:24,774 --> 02:01:28,051
General.
Excuse me, General.

1333
02:01:32,607 --> 02:01:35,771
R2-D2 may contain some 
much needed good news.

1334
02:01:35,796 --> 02:01:37,237
Tell me.

1335
02:01:46,176 --> 02:01:47,380
Poe, I need your map.

1336
02:01:47,405 --> 02:01:49,382
Yeah?
Alright, buddy, hold on.

1337
02:02:03,493 --> 02:02:05,883
Ha!
The map, it is complete.

1338
02:02:05,908 --> 02:02:07,337
Luke.

1339
02:02:07,605 --> 02:02:10,963
Oh, my dear friend, 
how I missed you.

1340
02:02:27,593 --> 02:02:29,587
We'll see each other again.

1341
02:02:29,869 --> 02:02:31,646
I believe that.

1342
02:02:39,732 --> 02:02:41,714
Thank you, my friend.

1343
02:02:56,402 --> 02:02:57,770
Rey.

1344
02:02:59,921 --> 02:03:02,136
May the Force be with you.

1345
02:06:49,836 --> 02:06:55,896
