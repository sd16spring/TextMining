1
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:39,364
We're under attack!
Light the signal!

2
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:06,221
- Light the fire now!
- Light the signal!

3
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,125
Now all of China knows you're here.

4
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,162
Perfect.

5
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:28,144
Your Majesty, the Huns have
crossed our northern border.

6
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:31,877
Impossible. No one can get
through the Great Wall.

7
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:35,785
Shan-Yu is leading them.

8
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,722
We'll set up defenses
around your palace immediately.

9
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:42,090
No. Send your troops
to protect my people.

10
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,824
- Chi Fu.
- Yes, Your Highness?

11
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:48,299
Deliver conscription notices
throughout all the provinces.

12
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,860
Call up reserves and as many
new recruits as possible.

13
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:56,068
Forgive me, Your Majesty, but
I believe my troops can stop him.

14
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,440
I won't take any chances, General.

15
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,503
A single grain of rice
can tip the scale.

16
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:05,381
One man may be the difference
between victory and defeat.

17
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:10,455
"Quiet and demure.

18
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,458
"Graceful. Polite.

19
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,494
"Delicate.

20
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,463
Refined. Poised.

21
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,066
Punctual."

22
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,972
Ai-yah! Little Brother!

23
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,033
Little Brother. Lit...

24
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,011
Ah! There you are.

25
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,207
Who's the smartest doggy
in the world?

26
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,147
Come on, smart boy.

27
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,209
Can you help me
with my chores today?

28
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:16,484
Honorable ancestors,

29
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:20,617
please help Mulan
impress the matchmaker today.

30
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,190
Please.

31
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,465
Please help her.

32
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,335
Father, I brought your... Whoa!

33
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,471
- Mulan.
- I brought a spare.

34
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,141
The doctor said three cups
of tea in the morning...

35
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,014
- Mulan.
...and three at night.

36
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,519
Mulan, you should already be in town.

37
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:53,082
We are counting on you
to uphold the family honor.

38
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,560
Don't worry, Father.
I won't let you down.

39
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,393
- Wish me luck.
- Hurry!

40
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,631
I'm going to... pray some more.

41
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,267
Fa Li, is your daughter here yet?

42
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,542
The matchmaker
is not a patient woman.

43
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,674
Of all days to be late.

44
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,548
I should have prayed
to the ancestors for luck.

45
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,680
How lucky can they be?
They're dead.

46
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,623
Besides, I've got
all the luck we'll need.

47
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,629
This is your chance
to prove yourself.

48
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,694
Grandma, no!

49
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,416
Yep, this cricket's a lucky one!

50
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,986
I'm here.

51
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,086
What? But, Mama, I had to...

52
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,894
None of your excuses.
Now, let's get you cleaned up.

53
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,206
It's freezing.

54
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:27,048
It would have been warm
if you were here on time.

55
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,363
Mulan, what's this?

56
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,990
Uh, notes.

57
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,331
In case I forget something.

58
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,429
Hold this.
We'll need more luck than I thought.

59
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,818
Huh?

60
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:15,094
- Calm.
- Obedient.

61
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,261
There. You're ready.

62
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,900
Not yet.
An apple for serenity.

63
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,843
A pendant for balance.

64
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,530
"Fa Mulan."

65
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:09,780
"Fa Mulan."

66
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,148
- Present.
- Speaking without permission.

67
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,811
Oops.

68
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,515
Who spit in her bean curd?

69
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,254
Huh. Hmm.

70
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,321
Mmm. Too skinny.

71
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,393
Hmph! Not good for bearing sons.

72
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:41,005
Recite the final admonition.

73
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,014
Mm-hmm.

74
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,347
Well?

75
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:51,447
Fulfill your duties calmly and...
respectfully.

76
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:55,187
Um, reflect before you snack...

77
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,230
Act! This shall bring you
honor and glory.

78
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:06,429
Hmm. This way.

79
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:13,307
Now, pour the tea.

80
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,815
To please your future in-laws,

81
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:20,784
you must demonstrate
a sense of dignity...

82
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,845
...and refinement.

83
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,289
You must also be poised.

84
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,718
Um, pardon me.

85
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,390
And silent!

86
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,400
Ahhh.

87
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,370
Could I just take that back?

88
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,804
One moment.

89
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,604
Why, you clumsy...

90
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,304
Whoo! Whoo!

91
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,176
Aaah! Whoo! Aaah!

92
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,989
I think it's going well, don't you?

93
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:06,157
Put it out! Put it out! Put it out!

94
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,238
You are a disgrace!

95
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,540
You may look like a bride,

96
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:25,277
but you will never
bring your family honor!

97
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,551
My, my.

98
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:53,394
What beautiful blossoms
we have this year.

99
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,797
But look.
This one's late.

100
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,362
But I'll bet that when it blooms,

101
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:06,978
it will be the most beautiful of all.

102
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,649
What is it?

103
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,788
Mulan.

104
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,892
Stay inside.

105
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,803
Citizens, I bring a proclamation

106
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,004
from the imperial city.

107
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,104
The Huns have invaded China.

108
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,509
By order of the emperor,

109
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:50,146
one man from every family
must serve in the Imperial army.

110
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,089
The Hsiao family.

111
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,552
The Yi family.

112
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,223
I will serve the emperor
in my father's place.

113
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,562
The Fa family.

114
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,067
No!

115
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,044
I am ready to serve the emperor.

116
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,247
- Father, you can't go.
- Mulan!

117
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:26,018
Please, sir, my father
has already fought bravely...

118
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,151
Silence! You would do well
to teach your daughter

119
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,857
to hold her tongue in a man's presence.

120
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,867
Mulan, you dishonor me.

121
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,405
Report tomorrow
to the Wu Zhong camp.

122
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,532
Yes, sir.

123
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,074
The Chu family!

124
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,806
The Wen family!

125
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,977
The Chang family!

126
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,645
- You shouldn't have to go!
- Mulan...

127
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,950
There are plenty of young men
to fight for China.

128
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:08,119
It is an honor to protect
my country and my family.

129
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,161
So, you'll die for honor.

130
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,595
I will die doing what's right.

131
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,564
- But if you...
- I know my place!

132
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,101
It is time you learned yours.

133
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,839
Mulan is gone!

134
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,675
What?

135
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,484
It can't be.

136
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,890
Mulan!

137
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,692
No.

138
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:06,367
You must go after her.
She could be killed.

139
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,633
If I reveal her,

140
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,766
she will be.

141
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:24,144
Ancestors, hear our prayer.

142
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,345
Watch over Mulan.

143
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,437
Mushu, awaken!

144
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,511
I live!

145
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:02,093
So, tell me what mortal needs
my protection, Great Ancestor.

146
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,027
- Just say the word and I'm there.
- Mushu...

147
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,760
Let me say somethin'. Anybody who's
foolish enough to threaten our family,

148
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,529
vengeance will be mine!

149
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,597
Mushu!

150
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:17,039
These are the family guardians.

151
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,440
They...

152
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,001
protect the family.

153
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,742
And you, o demoted one?

154
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:27,649
I... ring the gong.

155
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:32,053
That's right.
Now, wake up the ancestors.

156
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,992
One family reunion
comin' right up.

157
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,689
Okay, people, look alive.
Let's go. Come on. Get up.

158
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,254
Let's move it. Rise and shine.

159
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:43,267
Y'all way past the beauty sleep thing,
trust me.

160
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,232
I knew it. I knew it!

161
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,833
That Mulan was a troublemaker
from the start!

162
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,743
Don't look at me. She gets it
from your side of the family.

163
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,008
She's trying to help her father.

164
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,642
If she's discovered,
Fa Zhou will be forever shamed.

165
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:03,279
Dishonor will come to the family.
Traditional values will disintegrate.

166
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:07,416
- Not to mention, they'll lose the farm.
- My children never caused such trouble.

167
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:11,428
- They all became acupuncturists.
- Well, we can't all be acupuncturists.

168
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:15,398
No! Your great-granddaughter
had to be a cross-dresser!

169
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:21,803
- Let a guardian bring her back.
- Yes, awaken the most cunning.

170
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,841
No, the swiftest.

171
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,639
- No, send the wisest.
- Silence!

172
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,704
We must send
the most powerful of all.

173
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:35,014
Okay, okay, I get the drift.
I'll go.

174
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:41,388
Y'all don't think I can do it.
Watch this here.

175
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,587
Aha! Jump back.
I'm pretty hot, huh?

176
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,062
Don't make me singe nobody
to prove no point.

177
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,827
You had your chance
to protect the Fa family.

178
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,630
Your misguidance
led Fa Deng to disaster.

179
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,364
Yeah, thanks a lot.

180
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:54,666
And your point is?

181
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:00,337
The point is we will be sending
a real dragon to retrieve Mulan.

182
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,642
What? What?
I'm a real dragon!

183
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,978
You are not worthy of this spot.

184
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,213
Now, awaken the great stone dragon.

185
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,851
So you'll get back to me
on the job thing?

186
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,688
Just one chance.
Is that too much to ask?

187
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,993
It's not like it'll kill ya.

188
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,691
Yo, Rocky, wake up!

189
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,861
Ya gotta go fetch Mulan!

190
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,837
Come on, boy!
Go get her! Go on!

191
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,241
Come on.

192
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,344
Hello?

193
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,413
Hel-lo!

194
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,583
Hello!

195
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,820
Uh-oh.

196
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,098
Uh, Stony?

197
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:02,072
Stony? Oh, man, they're gonna kill me.

198
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,734
Great stone dragon,

199
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,506
have you awakened?

200
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:11,071
Uh, uh, uh, uh...
Yes, I just woke up!

201
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:14,983
I'm... I am the great stone dragon.
Good morning!

202
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,613
I will go forth and fetch Mulan.

203
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:21,022
Did... Did I mention that
I was the great stone dragon?

204
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,993
Go! The fate of the Fa family

205
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,724
rests in your claws.

206
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,234
Don't even worry about it.
I will not lose face.

207
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,640
Oh. My elbow!

208
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:38,232
I know I twisted somethin'.

209
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,502
That's just great.
Now what?

210
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,572
I'm doomed, and all 'cause Miss Man

211
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,482
decides to take her
little drag show on the road.

212
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,888
Go get her?
What's the matter with you?

213
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,154
After this great stone,
Humpty-Dumpty mess,

214
00:24:56,228 --> 00:25:00,562
I'd have to bring her home with
a medal to get back in the temple.

215
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,759
That's it!
I'll make Mulan a war hero.

216
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,064
They'll be begging me
to come back to work.

217
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,764
That's the master plan.
Ah, you done it now, man.

218
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,167
Hey, what makes you
think you're comin'?

219
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,904
You're lucky?

220
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,507
Do I look like a sucker to you?

221
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,211
What you mean, "a loser"?

222
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,880
How 'bout I pop
one of your antennas off?

223
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,549
Then who's the loser?

224
00:25:58,755 --> 00:26:01,519
Imperial scouts.

225
00:26:11,401 --> 00:26:13,028
Shan-Yu.

226
00:26:17,674 --> 00:26:21,667
Nice work, gentlemen.
You found the Hun army.

227
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:26,206
The emperor will stop you.

228
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:29,775
Stop me? He invited me.

229
00:26:31,621 --> 00:26:35,113
By building his wall,
he challenged my strength.

230
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:37,717
Well, I'm here to play his game.

231
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:43,599
Go! Tell your emperor
to send his strongest armies.

232
00:26:44,768 --> 00:26:46,065
I'm ready.

233
00:26:49,272 --> 00:26:52,605
How many men does it take
to deliver a message?

234
00:26:53,677 --> 00:26:55,269
One.

235
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,517
Okay, okay, how about this?

236
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:03,985
Excuse me.

237
00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:06,215
Where do I sign in?

238
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:10,385
Ha, I see you have a sword.
I have one, too.

239
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,690
They're very manly and... tough.

240
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,695
I'm working on it!

241
00:27:18,768 --> 00:27:21,794
Oh. Who am I fooling?

242
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:25,069
It's going to take a miracle
to get me into the army.

243
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:27,975
Did I hear someone
ask for a miracle?

244
00:27:28,044 --> 00:27:30,569
- Let me hear you say "aaah"!
- Aaah!

245
00:27:30,647 --> 00:27:32,842
- That's close enough.
- A ghost.

246
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:36,317
Get ready, Mulan.
Your serpentine salvation is at hand!

247
00:27:36,386 --> 00:27:39,549
For I have been sent
by your ancestors

248
00:27:39,623 --> 00:27:42,183
to guide you through
your masquerade.

249
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:44,386
If you're gonna stay,
you're gonna work.

250
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:48,761
So heed my word! 'Cause if the army
finds out you're a girl,

251
00:27:48,832 --> 00:27:52,199
the penalty is death!

252
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:53,668
Who are you?

253
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:56,297
Who am I? Who am I?

254
00:27:56,373 --> 00:27:59,865
I am the guardian of lost souls.

255
00:27:59,943 --> 00:28:02,571
I am the powerful,
the pleasurable,

256
00:28:02,646 --> 00:28:05,137
the indestructible Mushu.

257
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,541
Oh. Ha, ha.
Pretty hot, huh?

258
00:28:14,057 --> 00:28:18,721
Uh, my ancestors sent
a little lizard to help me?

259
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:21,525
Hey, dragon, dragon, not lizard.

260
00:28:21,598 --> 00:28:24,226
I don't do that tongue thing.

261
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:26,269
You're, um...

262
00:28:26,336 --> 00:28:28,600
Intimidating?
Awe-inspiring?

263
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:29,934
- Tiny.
- Of course.

264
00:28:30,006 --> 00:28:32,065
I'm travel-size
for your convenience.

265
00:28:32,142 --> 00:28:35,873
If I was my real size, your cow
here would die of fright.

266
00:28:35,946 --> 00:28:39,905
Down, Bessie. My powers are
beyond your mortal imagination.

267
00:28:39,983 --> 00:28:44,750
For instance, my eyes can see
straight through your armor. Oooh!

268
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:47,986
All right, that's it! Dishonor!

269
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:50,049
Dishonor on your whole family.

270
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:51,184
Make a note of this.

271
00:28:51,261 --> 00:28:53,821
Dishonor on you,
dishonor on your cow, dis...

272
00:28:53,897 --> 00:28:56,195
Stop. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

273
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:59,531
I'm just nervous.
I've never done this before.

274
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:03,039
Then you're gonna have to trust me.
And don't slap me no more.

275
00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:05,540
We clear on that?
All right.

276
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:08,874
Let's get this show on the road!
Cri-Kee, get the bags.

277
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:11,379
Let's move it, heifer.

278
00:29:14,718 --> 00:29:17,448
Okay, this is it.
Time to show 'em your man walk.

279
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,786
Shoulders back, chest high,
feet apart, head up and strut.

280
00:29:21,858 --> 00:29:26,261
Two, three. Break it down.
Hup, two, three. And work it!

281
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:32,034
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- They're disgusting.

282
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:35,469
No, they're men. You have to
act like them, so pay attention.

283
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:39,770
Look.
This tattoo will protect me from harm.

284
00:29:39,843 --> 00:29:41,936
Hmm.

285
00:29:43,713 --> 00:29:46,181
I hope you can get your money back!

286
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:48,410
I don't think I can do this.

287
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:51,147
It's all attitude.
Be tough, like this guy here.

288
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:54,315
What are you lookin' at?

289
00:29:54,391 --> 00:29:57,155
Punch him.
It's how men say hello.

290
00:29:58,728 --> 00:30:01,128
Oh, Yao, you've made a friend.

291
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:03,665
Good. Slap him on the behind.
They like that.

292
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:05,997
Whoa-ho-ho!

293
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:09,766
I'm gonna hit you so hard,
it'll make your ancestors dizzy.

294
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,640
Yao, relax and chant with me.

295
00:30:22,052 --> 00:30:24,486
Feel better?

296
00:30:24,554 --> 00:30:28,251
Yeah. Ahh, you ain't worth my time.

297
00:30:28,325 --> 00:30:30,350
- Chicken boy.
- Chicken boy?

298
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:32,691
Say that to my face, ya limp noodle!

299
00:30:36,366 --> 00:30:39,301
Oh. Sorry, Ling.

300
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:41,837
Hey!

301
00:30:41,905 --> 00:30:44,169
Whoa! You're dead!

302
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:49,839
Oh, there he goes!

303
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:10,665
Hey, guys.

304
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:13,999
The Huns have struck here,
here and here.

305
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,971
I will take the main troops
up to the Tung Shao Pass...

306
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,737
and stop Shan-Yu before
he destroys this village.

307
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:23,108
Excellent strategy, sir.

308
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:27,377
I do love surprises.

309
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,714
You will stay and train
the new recruits.

310
00:31:29,786 --> 00:31:32,346
When Chi Fu
believes you're ready,

311
00:31:32,422 --> 00:31:34,652
you will join us, Captain.

312
00:31:34,724 --> 00:31:36,692
Captain?

313
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,753
This is an enormous
responsibility, General.

314
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,821
Perhaps a soldier
with more experience...

315
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,764
Number one in his class,

316
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:47,132
extensive knowledge
of training techniques,

317
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:49,967
an impressive military lineage.

318
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,803
I believe Li Shang
will do an excellent job.

319
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:57,245
Oh, I will. I won't let you down.
This is... I mean...

320
00:31:57,313 --> 00:31:59,213
- Yes, sir.
- Very good then.

321
00:31:59,282 --> 00:32:03,878
We'll toast China's victory
at the imperial city.

322
00:32:03,953 --> 00:32:07,218
I'll expect a full report
in three weeks.

323
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:10,418
And I won't leave anything out.

324
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:15,193
Captain Li Shang.

325
00:32:15,265 --> 00:32:17,324
Hmm.

326
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,233
Leader of China's finest troops.

327
00:32:20,303 --> 00:32:23,602
No. The greatest troops of all time.

328
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:34,981
Most impressive.

329
00:32:38,054 --> 00:32:41,854
Good luck, Captain. Hyah!

330
00:32:47,897 --> 00:32:51,196
Good luck, Father.

331
00:32:58,374 --> 00:33:00,934
Day one.

332
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:04,672
Soldiers!

333
00:33:05,748 --> 00:33:07,613
He started it!

334
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:17,085
I don't need anyone
causing trouble in my camp.

335
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,185
Sorry. Uh...

336
00:33:19,262 --> 00:33:23,096
I mean, uh...
sorry you had to see that.

337
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:26,135
But you know how it is when
you get those manly urges

338
00:33:26,202 --> 00:33:28,170
and you just gotta kill something,

339
00:33:28,238 --> 00:33:31,867
Fix things, cook outdoors...

340
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:35,638
What's your name?

341
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:39,307
Your commanding officer
just asked you a question.

342
00:33:39,382 --> 00:33:43,716
Uh, I've got a name.
Ha! And it's a boy's name, too.

343
00:33:43,786 --> 00:33:46,584
- Ling. How 'bout Ling?
- His name is Ling.

344
00:33:46,656 --> 00:33:49,625
I didn't ask for his name.
I asked for yours!

345
00:33:49,692 --> 00:33:52,490
- Try, uh, uh, ah, Chu.
- Ah Chu.

346
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:54,587
- Ah Chu?
- Gesundheit.

347
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:56,097
Ha, ha. I kill myself.

348
00:33:56,165 --> 00:33:57,689
- Mushu.
- Mushu?

349
00:33:57,767 --> 00:33:59,359
- No.
- Then what is it?

350
00:33:59,435 --> 00:34:01,130
Ping was my best friend growin' up.

351
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:03,570
- It's Ping.
- Ping?

352
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,733
Of course, Ping did steal my...

353
00:34:05,808 --> 00:34:08,140
Yes, my name is Ping.

354
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:10,839
Let me see
your conscription notice.

355
00:34:10,914 --> 00:34:16,181
- Fa Zhou? The Fa Zhou?
- I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.

356
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:19,244
Um, he doesn't talk about me much.

357
00:34:24,394 --> 00:34:28,763
I can see why.
The boy's an absolute lunatic.

358
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,533
Okay, gentlemen,
thanks to your new friend, Ping,

359
00:34:34,604 --> 00:34:38,506
you'll spend tonight picking up
every single grain of rice.

360
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:42,110
And tomorrow, the real work begins.

361
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:48,244
You know, we have to work
on your people skills.

362
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,832
Rise and shine, sleeping beauty.

363
00:35:11,908 --> 00:35:14,206
Come on. Hup, hup, hup.

364
00:35:16,446 --> 00:35:20,314
Get your clothes on.
Get ready. Got breakfast for ya.

365
00:35:20,383 --> 00:35:24,979
Look, you get porridge,
and it's happy to see you.

366
00:35:25,054 --> 00:35:27,614
Hey, get outta there!
You gonna make people sick.

367
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,952
- Am I late?
- No time to talk.

368
00:35:29,025 --> 00:35:32,426
It's your first day of training.
Listen to your teacher and no fightin'.

369
00:35:32,495 --> 00:35:34,963
Play nice, unless one of the other kids
wanna fight.

370
00:35:35,031 --> 00:35:37,056
Then you have to kick
the other kid's butt.

371
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:39,158
I don't wanna kick
the other kid's butt.

372
00:35:39,235 --> 00:35:43,228
Don't talk with your mouth full.
Let's see your war face.

373
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:45,638
I think my bunny slippers
just ran for cover.

374
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,369
Come on! Scare me, girl.

375
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:49,434
Yeah!

376
00:35:49,512 --> 00:35:53,004
That's my tough-lookin' warrior.
Get out there and make me proud.

377
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:58,317
- The troops just left?
- They what?

378
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:04,186
Wait! You forgot your sword.

379
00:36:06,295 --> 00:36:09,025
My little baby,
off to destroy people.

380
00:36:14,137 --> 00:36:16,537
Order. People, order.

381
00:36:16,606 --> 00:36:19,473
- I'd like a pan-fried noodle.
- Oh! Sweet and pungent shrimp.

382
00:36:19,542 --> 00:36:22,010
- Moo goo gai pan.
- That's not funny!

383
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,543
Looks like our new friend
slept in this morning.

384
00:36:27,617 --> 00:36:31,212
Hello, Ping.
Are ya hungry?

385
00:36:31,287 --> 00:36:34,984
Yeah, 'cause I owe you
a knuckle sandwich.

386
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:37,151
Soldiers!

387
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:44,766
You will assemble swiftly
and silently every morning.

388
00:36:46,202 --> 00:36:48,693
Anyone who acts otherwise

389
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,762
will answer to me.

390
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,775
Ooh. Tough guy.

391
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:54,935
Yao.

392
00:37:00,616 --> 00:37:04,279
Thank you for volunteering.
Retrieve the arrow.

393
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:08,316
I'll get that arrow, pretty boy,

394
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:11,792
and I'll do it with my shirt on.

395
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:16,560
One moment.
You seem to be missing something.

396
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:22,367
This represents discipline,

397
00:37:24,107 --> 00:37:27,508
and this represents strength.

398
00:37:29,045 --> 00:37:32,105
You need both to reach the arrow.

399
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,670
We've got a long way to go.

400
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:17,554
Hoo-ah!

401
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,892
Hoo-ah!

402
00:41:30,853 --> 00:41:33,515
What do you see?

403
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:37,116
Black pine, from the high mountains.

404
00:41:38,527 --> 00:41:41,121
White horse hair.
Imperial stallions.

405
00:41:41,197 --> 00:41:44,360
Sulfur, from cannons.

406
00:41:44,433 --> 00:41:48,335
This doll came from a village
in the Tung Shao Pass,

407
00:41:48,404 --> 00:41:50,634
where the imperial army
is waiting for us.

408
00:41:50,706 --> 00:41:52,936
We can avoid them easily.

409
00:41:53,943 --> 00:41:55,467
No.

410
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:59,844
The quickest way to the
emperor is through that pass.

411
00:41:59,915 --> 00:42:04,716
And besides, the little girl
will be missing her doll.

412
00:42:04,787 --> 00:42:06,914
We should return it to her.

413
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:15,320
No, this is not
a good idea.

414
00:42:15,364 --> 00:42:17,059
What if somebody sees you?

415
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:20,534
Just because I look like a man
doesn't mean I have to smell like one.

416
00:42:20,603 --> 00:42:23,367
So a couple of guys
don't rinse out their socks.

417
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,736
Picky, picky, picky.

418
00:42:24,807 --> 00:42:27,867
Well, myself, I kind of like
that corn chip smell.

419
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:31,879
- Ahhh.
- All right. That's enough.

420
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:34,347
Get out before you
get all pruny and stuff.

421
00:42:34,417 --> 00:42:37,648
Mushu, if you're so worried,
go stand watch.

422
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,348
Yeah, yeah.
"Stand watch, Mushu,

423
00:42:40,423 --> 00:42:43,221
while I blow our secret
with my stupid girlie habits."

424
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:45,954
Pfft! Hygiene!

425
00:42:46,028 --> 00:42:49,122
Me first! Me first!

426
00:42:49,198 --> 00:42:50,495
We're doomed!

427
00:42:50,566 --> 00:42:53,433
There are a couple of things
I know they're bound to notice!

428
00:43:01,477 --> 00:43:03,468
Whooo-ooo!

429
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:12,286
Hey, Ping!

430
00:43:13,422 --> 00:43:16,448
Oh, hi, guys.
I didn't know you were here.

431
00:43:16,525 --> 00:43:20,017
I was just washing. So now I'm
clean, and I'm gonna go. Bye-bye.

432
00:43:20,096 --> 00:43:21,563
Come back here.

433
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:24,190
I know we were jerks to you before,

434
00:43:24,266 --> 00:43:26,734
so let's start over.

435
00:43:26,802 --> 00:43:29,999
Hi. I'm Ling.

436
00:43:30,072 --> 00:43:33,473
- And I'm Chien-Po.
- Hello, Chien-Po.

437
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:36,670
And I am Yao!

438
00:43:36,745 --> 00:43:38,736
King of the rock!

439
00:43:38,814 --> 00:43:42,250
And there's nothin'
you girls can do about it.

440
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:46,084
Oh, yeah? Well, I think Ping
and I can take you.

441
00:43:46,155 --> 00:43:48,146
I really don't wanna
take him anywhere.

442
00:43:48,224 --> 00:43:49,589
Ping, we have to fight!

443
00:43:49,658 --> 00:43:51,558
No, we don't.

444
00:43:51,627 --> 00:43:54,960
We could just close
our eyes and swim around.

445
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:57,362
Come on. Don't be such a gir...

446
00:43:57,433 --> 00:43:58,832
Ouch! Something bit me!

447
00:43:58,901 --> 00:44:01,461
What a nasty flavor.

448
00:44:01,537 --> 00:44:04,802
Snake!

449
00:44:07,343 --> 00:44:09,368
Oooh, snake! Snake!

450
00:44:09,445 --> 00:44:13,711
Snake! Snake!

451
00:44:13,782 --> 00:44:17,240
Some king of the rock. Aah!

452
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:19,378
Boy, that was close.

453
00:44:19,455 --> 00:44:22,083
No. That was vile.

454
00:44:22,158 --> 00:44:24,752
You owe me big.

455
00:44:24,827 --> 00:44:28,820
I never want to see a naked man again.

456
00:44:33,202 --> 00:44:35,227
Hey, don't look at me.

457
00:44:35,304 --> 00:44:37,795
I ain't bitin' no more butts.

458
00:44:37,873 --> 00:44:40,603
You think your troops
are ready to fight?

459
00:44:40,676 --> 00:44:44,203
Ha! They would not last
a minute against the Huns!

460
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,077
They completed their training.

461
00:44:46,148 --> 00:44:49,515
Those boys are no more fit
to be soldiers

462
00:44:49,585 --> 00:44:51,382
than you are to be captain.

463
00:44:51,453 --> 00:44:53,978
Once the general reads my report,

464
00:44:54,056 --> 00:44:56,684
your troops will never see battle.

465
00:44:56,759 --> 00:44:57,748
Oh, no, you don't!

466
00:44:57,826 --> 00:45:00,454
I've worked too hard
to get Mulan into this war.

467
00:45:00,529 --> 00:45:02,360
This guy's messin' with my plan.

468
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:04,490
We're not finished!

469
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:05,727
Be careful, Captain.

470
00:45:05,801 --> 00:45:07,894
The general may be your father,

471
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,871
but I am the emperor's counsel.

472
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,965
And, oh, by the way,

473
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:15,909
I got that job on my own.

474
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:18,640
You're dismissed.

475
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:23,350
Hey. I'll hold him, and you punch.

476
00:45:23,419 --> 00:45:27,014
Or not.

477
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:31,617
For what it's worth,
I think you're a great captain.

478
00:45:36,966 --> 00:45:39,127
- I saw that.
- What?

479
00:45:39,201 --> 00:45:41,635
You like him, don't you?

480
00:45:41,704 --> 00:45:44,332
- No! I...
- Yeah, right, sure.

481
00:45:44,406 --> 00:45:46,067
Go to your tent!

482
00:45:50,779 --> 00:45:51,841
I think it's time we took this war

483
00:45:51,876 --> 00:45:52,904
I think it's time we took this war

484
00:45:52,982 --> 00:45:55,075
into our own hands.

485
00:46:13,335 --> 00:46:14,825
Let me see what you got.

486
00:46:14,903 --> 00:46:17,929
"From General Li. Dear son,
we're waiting for Huns at the pass.

487
00:46:18,007 --> 00:46:20,134
It would mean a lot
if you'd come back us up."

488
00:46:20,209 --> 00:46:23,576
That's great. Except you forgot,
"Since we're out of potpourri,

489
00:46:23,646 --> 00:46:25,807
perhaps you wouldn't mind
bringing some."

490
00:46:25,881 --> 00:46:28,714
Hello! This is the army!
Make it sound more urgent!

491
00:46:28,784 --> 00:46:30,149
Know what I'm talkin' about?

492
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:38,084
That's better.
Much better. Let's go.

493
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,028
Khanny, baby.
Hey, we need a ride.

494
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:51,266
Insubordinate ruffians!

495
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,638
You men owe me
a new pair of slippers!

496
00:46:55,244 --> 00:46:58,941
And I do not squeal like a girl.

497
00:46:59,014 --> 00:47:01,881
Urgent news from the general.

498
00:47:03,886 --> 00:47:06,821
What's the matter? You've never
seen a black and white before?

499
00:47:09,258 --> 00:47:11,351
Who are you?

500
00:47:11,427 --> 00:47:15,420
Excuse me?
I think the question is, who are you?

501
00:47:15,497 --> 00:47:18,295
We're in a war, man!
There's no time for stupid questions!

502
00:47:18,367 --> 00:47:21,768
I should have your hat for that.
Snatch it right off your head.

503
00:47:21,837 --> 00:47:25,705
But I'm feeling gracious today,
so carry on before I report you.

504
00:47:30,245 --> 00:47:32,577
Captain, urgent news
from the general!

505
00:47:32,648 --> 00:47:34,513
We're needed at the front.

506
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:35,600
Pack your bags, Cri-Kee.
We're movin' out.

507
00:47:35,635 --> 00:47:36,617
Pack your bags, Cri-Kee.
We're movin' out.

508
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:03,367
- Huh?
- That's what I said.

509
00:49:04,773 --> 00:49:08,504
nah!

510
00:50:18,244 --> 00:50:20,109
Search for survivors.

511
00:50:49,542 --> 00:50:54,377
I don't understand.
My father should've been here.

512
00:50:54,447 --> 00:50:56,312
Captain!

513
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,951
The general.

514
00:51:50,136 --> 00:51:52,001
I'm sorry.

515
00:52:10,723 --> 00:52:13,283
The Huns are moving quickly.

516
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,759
We'll make better time
to the Imperial city

517
00:52:15,828 --> 00:52:17,489
through the Tung Shao Pass.

518
00:52:17,563 --> 00:52:20,430
We're the only hope
for the emperor now.

519
00:52:20,499 --> 00:52:22,364
Move out!

520
00:53:12,818 --> 00:53:15,150
What happened?

521
00:53:15,221 --> 00:53:18,213
- Um...
- You gave away our position!

522
00:53:24,196 --> 00:53:26,630
Get out of range!

523
00:53:33,005 --> 00:53:34,870
Aah!

524
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:40,840
Save the cannons!

525
00:53:40,913 --> 00:53:44,178
Come on! Empty it! Empty it!

526
00:53:57,329 --> 00:53:59,695
Hey!

527
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:04,166
Oh, sure.
Save the horse.

528
00:54:09,742 --> 00:54:11,903
Fire!

529
00:54:21,587 --> 00:54:23,521
Fire!

530
00:54:29,828 --> 00:54:31,420
Hold the last cannon.

531
00:54:57,556 --> 00:54:58,750
Prepare to fight.

532
00:54:58,824 --> 00:55:01,292
If we die, we die with honor.

533
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:21,138
Yao, aim the cannon at Shan-Yu.

534
00:55:32,624 --> 00:55:35,821
- Hey!
- Ping! Come back!

535
00:55:35,894 --> 00:55:38,590
Ping!

536
00:55:52,244 --> 00:55:54,075
Stop!

537
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,844
You might want
to light that right about now.

538
00:56:02,921 --> 00:56:05,355
Quickly. Quickly!

539
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:09,992
Come on!
We gotta help!

540
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:20,497
You missed!

541
00:56:20,572 --> 00:56:24,372
How could you miss?
He was three feet in front of you!

542
00:56:52,271 --> 00:56:55,763
Whoa-ho-ho!

543
00:57:26,872 --> 00:57:29,102
Mulan!

544
00:57:31,944 --> 00:57:33,969
Mulan!

545
00:57:34,046 --> 00:57:35,741
Mulan?

546
00:57:35,814 --> 00:57:37,805
No.

547
00:57:37,883 --> 00:57:39,908
Mulan!

548
00:57:41,353 --> 00:57:43,617
Man, you are one lucky bug.

549
00:57:52,531 --> 00:57:55,398
Shang!

550
00:58:00,706 --> 00:58:04,301
- Do you see them?
- Yes.

551
00:58:07,513 --> 00:58:11,677
Perfect.
Now we'll pull them to safe... ty.

552
00:58:14,186 --> 00:58:17,053
Hey, Mulan!
I found the lucky cricket!

553
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:19,056
We need help.

554
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:21,725
Ooh, nice.

555
00:58:21,793 --> 00:58:24,762
Very nice.
You can sit by me.

556
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:25,819
Aah!

557
00:58:25,898 --> 00:58:29,595
We're gonna die!
We are definitely gonna die.

558
00:58:29,668 --> 00:58:32,728
No way we survive this.
Death is coming!

559
00:58:34,506 --> 00:58:39,170
I let them
slip through my fingers.

560
00:58:39,244 --> 00:58:41,940
Aah!

561
00:58:42,014 --> 00:58:43,811
Pull!

562
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:47,182
Whoa!

563
00:58:47,252 --> 00:58:48,412
Huh?

564
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,186
I knew we could do it.
You the man!

565
00:58:58,263 --> 00:59:00,458
Well, sort of.

566
00:59:04,169 --> 00:59:06,694
Step back, guys.
Give him some air.

567
00:59:06,772 --> 00:59:09,866
Ping?

568
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:13,671
You are the craziest man
I've ever met.

569
00:59:15,147 --> 00:59:17,615
And for that, I owe you my life.

570
00:59:17,683 --> 00:59:21,210
From now on,
you have my trust.

571
00:59:21,286 --> 00:59:25,052
Let's hear it for Ping!
The bravest of us all!

572
00:59:25,123 --> 00:59:28,650
- You're king of the mountain!
- Yes, yes, yes!

573
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:33,391
Ping! What's wrong?

574
00:59:37,135 --> 00:59:39,865
He's wounded! Get help!

575
00:59:39,938 --> 00:59:42,930
Ping.

576
00:59:43,008 --> 00:59:44,999
Hold on.

577
00:59:45,077 --> 00:59:46,942
Hold on.

578
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:17,739
I can explain.

579
01:00:18,977 --> 01:00:21,445
So it's true!

580
01:00:21,513 --> 01:00:23,845
Shang!

581
01:00:23,915 --> 01:00:26,748
I knew there was
something wrong with you.

582
01:00:26,818 --> 01:00:29,252
A woman!

583
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:32,381
Treacherous snake!

584
01:00:32,457 --> 01:00:34,857
My name is Mulan.

585
01:00:34,926 --> 01:00:38,453
- I did it to save my father.
- High treason!

586
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:40,555
I didn't mean for it to go this far.

587
01:00:40,632 --> 01:00:42,793
Ultimate dishonor!

588
01:00:42,868 --> 01:00:46,531
It was the only way.
Please, believe me.

589
01:00:46,605 --> 01:00:49,836
Captain?

590
01:00:56,648 --> 01:00:59,116
Restrain him!

591
01:01:01,486 --> 01:01:04,319
- No!
- You know the law.

592
01:01:16,635 --> 01:01:19,069
A life for a life.

593
01:01:19,137 --> 01:01:21,435
My debt is repaid.

594
01:01:23,342 --> 01:01:26,834
- Move out!
- But you can't just...

595
01:01:26,912 --> 01:01:29,779
I said move out.

596
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:07,675
I was this close.

597
01:02:07,753 --> 01:02:10,984
This close to impressin' the ancestors,

598
01:02:11,056 --> 01:02:13,752
gettin' the top shelf, an entourage.

599
01:02:13,825 --> 01:02:17,352
Man. All my fine work. Pfft.

600
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:23,166
Hi.

601
01:02:23,235 --> 01:02:26,261
I should never have left home.

602
01:02:26,338 --> 01:02:29,432
Hey, come on.
You went to save your father's life.

603
01:02:29,508 --> 01:02:32,602
Who knew you'd end up shamin' him,
disgracing your ancestors

604
01:02:32,677 --> 01:02:36,408
and losin' all your friends?
You know, you just gotta...

605
01:02:36,481 --> 01:02:38,415
you gotta learn
to let these things go.

606
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:43,179
Maybe I didn't go for my father.

607
01:02:43,255 --> 01:02:45,246
Maybe what I really wanted

608
01:02:45,323 --> 01:02:48,087
was to prove I could do things right.

609
01:02:49,127 --> 01:02:51,960
So when I looked in the mirror,

610
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:54,521
I'd see someone worthwhile.

611
01:02:57,135 --> 01:02:58,796
But I was wrong.

612
01:03:00,138 --> 01:03:02,436
I see nothing.

613
01:03:11,516 --> 01:03:14,542
That's just 'cause this needs
a little spit, that's all.

614
01:03:14,619 --> 01:03:18,020
Let me shine this up for ya.

615
01:03:18,089 --> 01:03:21,252
I can see you. Look at you.
You look so pretty.

616
01:03:26,064 --> 01:03:28,794
The truth is, we're both frauds.

617
01:03:28,867 --> 01:03:31,927
Your ancestors never sent me.
They don't even like me.

618
01:03:32,003 --> 01:03:34,733
I mean, you risked your life
to help people you love.

619
01:03:34,806 --> 01:03:36,774
I risked your life to help myself.

620
01:03:36,842 --> 01:03:39,709
At least you had good intentions.

621
01:03:42,981 --> 01:03:45,541
What? What do you mean
you're not lucky?

622
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:48,518
You lied to me?

623
01:03:48,587 --> 01:03:50,782
And what are you, a sheep?

624
01:03:50,856 --> 01:03:52,847
Ah!

625
01:03:52,924 --> 01:03:56,018
I'll have to face my father
sooner or later.

626
01:03:58,029 --> 01:03:59,519
Let's go home.

627
01:03:59,598 --> 01:04:02,931
Yeah. This ain't gonna be pretty.

628
01:04:03,001 --> 01:04:07,028
But don't you worry, okay?
Things will work out.

629
01:04:07,105 --> 01:04:10,734
We started this thing together,
and that's how we'll finish it.

630
01:04:12,611 --> 01:04:15,011
I promise.

631
01:05:36,828 --> 01:05:39,388
Uh, home is that way.

632
01:05:39,464 --> 01:05:42,763
- I have to do something.
- Did you see those Huns?

633
01:05:42,834 --> 01:05:45,701
They popped out of the snow!
Like daisies!

634
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:48,898
Are we in this together or not?

635
01:05:52,477 --> 01:05:55,913
Well, let's go kick some Hunny buns!

636
01:05:55,981 --> 01:05:58,006
Yee-haw!

637
01:06:17,268 --> 01:06:21,068
Make way for the heroes of China.

638
01:06:35,387 --> 01:06:37,719
- Shang!
- Mulan?

639
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:40,223
The Huns are alive!
They're in the city!

640
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:42,953
You don't belong here, Mulan.
Go home.

641
01:06:45,697 --> 01:06:49,656
I saw them in the mountains.
You have to believe me.

642
01:06:49,734 --> 01:06:51,326
Why should I?

643
01:06:54,773 --> 01:06:57,537
Why else would I come back?

644
01:06:57,609 --> 01:07:02,342
You said you'd trust Ping.
Why is Mulan any different?

645
01:07:09,854 --> 01:07:14,416
Keep your eyes open.
I know they're here. Yah!

646
01:07:21,833 --> 01:07:24,734
Now where are you going?

647
01:07:24,803 --> 01:07:27,397
To find someone
who will believe me.

648
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:02,200
My children,
heaven smiles down

649
01:08:02,273 --> 01:08:04,503
upon the Middle Kingdom.

650
01:08:04,576 --> 01:08:08,273
China will sleep safely tonight

651
01:08:08,346 --> 01:08:11,076
thanks to our brave warriors.

652
01:08:14,185 --> 01:08:16,619
Sir, the emperor's in danger.

653
01:08:16,688 --> 01:08:18,918
But the Huns are here.

654
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:21,788
Please, you have to help.

655
01:08:23,661 --> 01:08:25,026
No one will listen.

656
01:08:25,096 --> 01:08:27,326
Huh? I'm sorry.
Did you say something?

657
01:08:27,398 --> 01:08:31,129
- Mushu.
- You're a girl again, remember?

658
01:08:31,202 --> 01:08:33,136
Your Majesty,

659
01:08:33,204 --> 01:08:36,833
I present to you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

660
01:08:36,908 --> 01:08:40,275
I know what this means to you,
Captain Li.

661
01:08:40,345 --> 01:08:43,974
Your father would have been very proud.

662
01:09:10,975 --> 01:09:13,967
- No!
- Come on!

663
01:09:31,162 --> 01:09:33,756
They'll never reach the emperor in time.

664
01:09:37,569 --> 01:09:40,037
Hey, guys!

665
01:09:40,104 --> 01:09:42,538
I've got an idea.

666
01:10:27,018 --> 01:10:29,953
Boo.

667
01:10:30,021 --> 01:10:31,488
Guard the door.

668
01:10:37,595 --> 01:10:40,530
Your walls and armies have fallen,

669
01:10:40,598 --> 01:10:42,896
and now it's your turn.

670
01:10:42,967 --> 01:10:44,867
Bow to me.

671
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,399
Okay. Any questions?

672
01:10:51,476 --> 01:10:53,467
Does this dress make me look fat?

673
01:10:53,544 --> 01:10:55,375
Ow!

674
01:10:55,446 --> 01:10:57,641
Who's there?

675
01:11:00,385 --> 01:11:03,843
- Concubines.
- Ugly concubines.

676
01:11:03,922 --> 01:11:05,412
Oh, he's so cute!

677
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:14,598
Ohh...

678
01:11:18,169 --> 01:11:20,296
Now, that's what I call
Mongolian barbecue.

679
01:11:38,222 --> 01:11:39,814
Shang, go!

680
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,627
I tire of your arrogance, old man.
Bow to me!

681
01:11:44,662 --> 01:11:47,094
I tire of your arrogance, old man.
Bow to me!

682
01:11:47,165 --> 01:11:52,933
No matter how the wind howls,
the mountain cannot bow to it.

683
01:11:53,004 --> 01:11:56,940
Then you will kneel in pieces!

684
01:12:09,153 --> 01:12:11,383
Chien-Po, get the emperor!

685
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:14,084
Sorry, Your Majesty.

686
01:12:17,895 --> 01:12:19,192
No!

687
01:12:28,706 --> 01:12:30,071
Come on!

688
01:12:46,024 --> 01:12:47,889
No.

689
01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:00,631
You!

690
01:13:02,073 --> 01:13:04,439
You took away my victory!

691
01:13:04,509 --> 01:13:05,976
No!

692
01:13:06,911 --> 01:13:07,969
I did.

693
01:13:11,449 --> 01:13:14,179
The soldier from the mountains.

694
01:13:24,228 --> 01:13:26,594
So what's the plan?

695
01:13:26,664 --> 01:13:28,859
- Um...
- You don't have a plan?

696
01:13:28,933 --> 01:13:32,801
Hey, I'm making this up as I... go.

697
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:35,338
- Mushu!
- Way ahead of you, sister.

698
01:13:35,406 --> 01:13:37,670
Come on, Cri-Kee.

699
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:59,821
- Citizens, I need firepower.
- Who are you?

700
01:13:59,897 --> 01:14:02,297
Your worst nightmare!

701
01:14:06,204 --> 01:14:07,762
- On the roof!
- Look!

702
01:14:25,022 --> 01:14:28,116
It looks like you're out of ideas.

703
01:14:30,962 --> 01:14:32,520
Not quite.

704
01:14:32,597 --> 01:14:34,895
Ready, Mushu?

705
01:14:34,966 --> 01:14:38,402
I am ready, baby!
Light me.

706
01:14:47,512 --> 01:14:50,481
Huh?

707
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:55,182
Get off the roof, get off the roof,
get off the roof.

708
01:15:14,005 --> 01:15:17,133
You are a lucky bug.

709
01:15:24,182 --> 01:15:26,878
That was a deliberate attempt
on my life!

710
01:15:26,951 --> 01:15:29,579
Where is she?
Now she's done it.

711
01:15:29,654 --> 01:15:32,020
What a mess!
Stand aside!

712
01:15:32,089 --> 01:15:35,286
That creature's not worth protecting.

713
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:37,350
- She's a hero.
- 'Tis a woman.

714
01:15:37,428 --> 01:15:40,522
- She'll never be worth anything.
- Listen, you pompous...

715
01:15:40,598 --> 01:15:43,692
That is enough.

716
01:15:48,706 --> 01:15:51,436
Your Majesty, I can explain.

717
01:15:59,217 --> 01:16:03,017
I've heard a great deal about you,
Fa Mulan.

718
01:16:04,388 --> 01:16:06,379
You stole your father's armor,

719
01:16:06,457 --> 01:16:08,687
ran away from home,

720
01:16:08,759 --> 01:16:10,852
impersonated a soldier,

721
01:16:10,928 --> 01:16:13,294
deceived your commanding officer,

722
01:16:13,364 --> 01:16:17,630
dishonored the Chinese army,
destroyed my palace...

723
01:16:17,702 --> 01:16:19,465
and...

724
01:16:19,537 --> 01:16:22,665
you have saved us all.

725
01:16:29,413 --> 01:16:31,040
Ah! Ooh!

726
01:16:53,204 --> 01:16:57,573
My little baby is all grown up
and... and savin' China.

727
01:16:57,642 --> 01:16:59,542
You have a tissue?

728
01:17:02,346 --> 01:17:05,338
- Chi Fu.
- Your Excellency?

729
01:17:05,416 --> 01:17:08,749
See to it that this woman
is made a member of my council.

730
01:17:08,819 --> 01:17:11,344
Member... what?
But...

731
01:17:11,422 --> 01:17:16,121
There are no council positions open,
Your Majesty.

732
01:17:16,193 --> 01:17:18,991
Very well.
You can have his job.

733
01:17:19,063 --> 01:17:21,827
What? I... Oh.

734
01:17:24,035 --> 01:17:27,027
With all due respect,
Your Excellency,

735
01:17:27,104 --> 01:17:29,834
I think I've been away
from home long enough.

736
01:17:29,907 --> 01:17:32,205
Then... take this,

737
01:17:32,276 --> 01:17:36,906
so your family will know
what you have done for me.

738
01:17:36,981 --> 01:17:39,040
And this,

739
01:17:39,116 --> 01:17:44,520
so the world will know
what you have done for China.

740
01:17:49,827 --> 01:17:52,921
Is she allowed to do that?

741
01:18:06,777 --> 01:18:09,974
Um... you...

742
01:18:10,047 --> 01:18:12,572
You fight good.

743
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:15,517
Oh. Thank you.

744
01:18:24,028 --> 01:18:26,758
Khan, let's go home.

745
01:18:34,038 --> 01:18:37,496
The flower that blooms in adversity

746
01:18:37,575 --> 01:18:41,204
is the most rare and beautiful of all.

747
01:18:41,278 --> 01:18:42,267
Sir?

748
01:18:42,346 --> 01:18:46,305
You don't meet a girl
like that every dynasty.

749
01:19:17,114 --> 01:19:18,809
Mulan!

750
01:19:18,883 --> 01:19:22,614
Father, I brought you
the sword of Shan-Yu.

751
01:19:24,088 --> 01:19:26,886
And the crest of the emperor.

752
01:19:28,225 --> 01:19:31,752
They're gifts,
to honor the Fa family.

753
01:19:38,235 --> 01:19:43,537
The greatest gift and honor
is having you for a daughter.

754
01:19:44,909 --> 01:19:47,275
I've missed you so.

755
01:19:47,344 --> 01:19:49,574
I've missed you, too, Baba.

756
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:58,618
Great. She brings a sword.

757
01:19:58,689 --> 01:20:01,317
If you ask me, she should've
brought home a man.

758
01:20:01,392 --> 01:20:02,381
Excuse me.

759
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:04,826
Does Fa Mulan live here?

760
01:20:07,264 --> 01:20:08,629
Thank you.

761
01:20:08,699 --> 01:20:12,135
Whoo! Sign me up for the next war!

762
01:20:14,071 --> 01:20:17,563
Honorable Fa Zhou, I...
Mulan!

763
01:20:17,641 --> 01:20:20,940
Uh... you forgot your helmet.

764
01:20:21,011 --> 01:20:24,037
W-well, actually,
it's your helmet, isn't it?

765
01:20:24,114 --> 01:20:25,775
I mean...

766
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:28,182
Would you like to stay for dinner?

767
01:20:28,252 --> 01:20:31,688
Would you
like to stay forever?

768
01:20:31,755 --> 01:20:33,746
Dinner would be great.

769
01:20:37,228 --> 01:20:39,856
Come on.
Who did a good job?

770
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:42,330
Come on. Tell me.
Who did a good job?

771
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:46,995
Oh, all right!
You can be a guardian again.

772
01:20:47,071 --> 01:20:50,871
Aah-ha!
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

773
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:58,273
Take it, Cri-Kee!

774
01:21:00,618 --> 01:21:03,746
You know, she gets it
from my side of the family.

775
01:21:08,559 --> 01:21:10,652
Call out for egg rolls!

776
01:21:10,728 --> 01:21:14,425
Guardians.

777
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:18,157
- Oh.
- Thanks, Mushu.

778
01:21:21,872 --> 01:21:25,308
Mushu!
