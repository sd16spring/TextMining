1
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:08,486
Referee,
why don't you stop the fight?

2
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:17,746
Let's go!
Let's go!

3
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:24,711
Come on! Get him!

4
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:28,381
Come on! Hit him!
Hit him!

5
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:54,866
You're Waltzing.
Give the sucker some action.

6
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,369
You're fighting like a bum.
Want some advice?

7
00:01:58,411 --> 00:01:59,537
Water.

8
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:01,539
Cold beer here!

9
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:06,211
Should I bet the fight don't go
three rounds? You feel strong?

10
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:08,713
- Absolutely.
- Cold beer!

11
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:11,716
- You want good advice?
- Mouthpiece.

12
00:02:22,936 --> 00:02:24,479
Come on, Rock!

13
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:35,592
All right. All right.

14
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:40,638
Next a six-rounder
between local lightweights Kid Brooks

15
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:42,473
and Sugar Johnson.

16
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,358
Good going, champ.

17
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:55,820
- Hey.
- Say what?

18
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:58,990
- You got a smoke?
- Yeah, you can have this one.

19
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:01,367
You're a bum.

20
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:04,662
You're a bum, you know that?
You're a bum!

21
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,526
You really got lucky tonight.

22
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,153
Spider, here's loser's share.

23
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,864
$40, less $15 locker and cornerman,

24
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:42,742
$5 shower and towel, 7 percent tax.

25
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:44,869
Comes to 17.20.

26
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:47,330
You fought a good fight, Spider.

27
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:49,707
Balboa, you get winner's share, $65.

28
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:54,712
Less $15 locker and cornerman,
$5 shower and towel and 7% tax.

29
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:57,215
Comes to 40.55.

30
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:01,010
- When do I fight again?
- Maybe two weeks.

31
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:04,973
Give me a call. The doctor should be in
in about 20 minutes.

32
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:42,927
Hey, boy.

33
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:41,235
You guys are getting
better every year.

34
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:42,987
Yeah.

35
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:58,062
Hey, your old man did
pretty good tonight.

36
00:07:58,146 --> 00:07:59,981
Why weren't you there?

37
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:02,775
You should've seen me.
You guys hungry?

38
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:06,696
Here you go.

39
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,282
Here you go.

40
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:14,579
You wanna see your
friend Moby Dick, huh?

41
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:20,793
How you doing, Moby Dick?
You miss me today?

42
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:26,090
Here you go. Say hi.

43
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:29,844
If you guys could sing or dance,
I wouldn't be doing this.

44
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:50,031
And this turtle food
I got here, it's...

45
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:53,409
This turtle food I got here
has more flies in it...

46
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,369
There are more moths
in it than flies.

47
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:58,623
More flies... More moths...
Who the hell cares?

48
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:22,081
How you feeling this morning?
Full of life?

49
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:23,541
Fine.

50
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,543
How you doing, killer?

51
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,587
- How's the turtle food this week?
- Fine.

52
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,340
I'm kind of aggravated.

53
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:32,633
Oh, I'm sorry.

54
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:35,344
Ain't your fault.
You don't wanna hear about it?

55
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:37,221
I'll tell you somebody
who don't wanna hear about it.

56
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:39,265
- How you doing, Gloria?
- Good.

57
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:43,519
The last turtle food I got here had
more moths in it than flies, Adrian.

58
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:45,396
These moths get caught
in the turtle's throat

59
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:48,441
and they cough, and I gotta smack
them on the back of the shell

60
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,401
and what do you think they get?

61
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,028
They get what?

62
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,365
Come on.
Shell shock.

63
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,409
They get shell-shocked.
What do you think?

64
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,578
You're starting with
the bad jokes early, huh?

65
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,205
Well, no. Inventing jokes
ain't so easy sometimes.

66
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,166
No, that wasn't no joke.

67
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:08,377
Hey, how's my buddy doing today?
Yo, Butkus.

68
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:10,087
Yo, Butkus!

69
00:11:11,172 --> 00:11:12,548
What is it?

70
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,721
Hey, give me a kiss.

71
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:22,892
Adrian, go downstairs and clean
all the cat cages. They're a mess.

72
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:40,034
You gotta pay for that
turtle food, rock head.

73
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:43,371
Hey, crime don't pay.
You know that, Gloria.

74
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:10,314
- Yo, Rock, how's your boss?
- Real good.

75
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:12,358
Hey, Rock, you fighting again?

76
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,402
- Here and there.
- We'll make some money real soon, huh?

77
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:16,487
Yeah, a million dollars.

78
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:19,323
Hey, you. Where are you going?

79
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:27,373
Where are you going?
Where you running?

80
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,000
- Where you running?
- Hey! Hey!

81
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:32,628
- Hey! Don't hit the face!
- Shut up!

82
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,005
- Not the face!
- Mr. Gazzo wants the 200 now.

83
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,340
I'm broke!

84
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:39,552
Mr. Gazzo says I should get the 200
or break your thumb. You understand?

85
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:42,471
- Please, don't...
- What's your name again?

86
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:46,308
- Bob!
- Bob. Listen, Bob.

87
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,020
You wanna dance, you gotta
pay the band. You understand?

88
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:52,356
You wanna borrow,
you gotta pay the man.

89
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,818
Hey, I ain't emotionally involved, Bob.
You understand?

90
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,529
Give me some money.
Give me some money.

91
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:04,743
There's 130 here.

92
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:06,787
That's it. I'm broke.

93
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:10,291
Hey, Bob, you're still $70 light.

94
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,711
You don't have to break nothing.
Take my coat.

95
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,880
It's worth $50, $60.

96
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:17,965
Take the coat!

97
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,051
You know, you should've
planned ahead.

98
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:23,262
You know that?
You should've planned ahead.

99
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,681
We'll fake it. I'll tape up the hand
like you broke the thumb!

100
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:28,350
- Should've planned ahead.
- Gazzo don't have to know!

101
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:31,479
He won't be wise to nothing!
Gazzo won't be wise to nothing!

102
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,356
Keep the coat! Keep the...

103
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:07,515
He only had 130, but I think he's good
for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.

104
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,934
Sure, Rocky. Bob's good for it.

105
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,937
That's it for today.

106
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:17,316
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio.
He's late three weeks. I don't like it.

107
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,735
Tomorrow, three weeks. Del Rio?

108
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:22,363
All right, I got it.
How do you spell Del Rio?

109
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:24,782
- How'd you do last night?
- I did real good.

110
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,242
- Hey.
- What?

111
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:29,161
- Did you get the license number?
- Of what?

112
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:31,121
The truck that run over your face.

113
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:33,290
Relax, Buddy.
Pull it over here.

114
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:36,794
I wanna let Rocky out.
I'm gonna talk to him for a few seconds.

115
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,527
Why didn't you break
this guy's thumb?

116
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,904
- How do you know I didn't?
- You don't think I hear things?

117
00:15:03,988 --> 00:15:05,823
Didn't I give you
a job this morning?

118
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,742
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you break his thumb?

119
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:12,663
When you don't do what I tell you
to do, you make me look bad.

120
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,791
I figured... Look. I figured
if I break the guy's thumb,

121
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,209
he gets laid off.

122
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:20,170
- He can't make money.
- Let me do the figuring.

123
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,673
From here on in,
let me do the figuring.

124
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:26,760
These guys think we're running
a charity, they'll get off light.

125
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:29,346
From here on in,
do what I tell you to do,

126
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,931
because it's bad for my reputation.

127
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:33,767
You understand?
You got it, Rock?

128
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,103
I got it.

129
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,983
How do you spell Del Rio?

130
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:43,819
- Look it up in a dictionary.
- Come on!

131
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:47,072
I won't let that happen
no more, about the thumb.

132
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,242
You know?

133
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,078
So long, meat bag.

134
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:58,208
I should've broke your thumbs!

135
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:29,990
Hey, Rock.
Heard you did good last night.

136
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:33,118
- Absolutely. Should've seen me.
- Shouldn't you take a rest?

137
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:35,079
- No, my back is hurt.
- Your back?

138
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,247
My back is hurt.
You deaf?

139
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:38,874
No, I'm short.

140
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,023
Hey, yo, Mike.

141
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:48,068
Where's my lock?
Whose stuff is this in my locker?

142
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:51,363
It's Dipper's stuff.
It ain't your locker no more.

143
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,618
What you talking about?
It's been my locker for six years.

144
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,078
Where's my gear?

145
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,789
Mickey told me to
bag it and hang it.

146
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:07,671
You put my stuff on skid row.

147
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:11,800
I been in that locker for six years,
and you put my stuff on skid row?

148
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:14,303
Mickey tells me what to do,
I gotta do it.

149
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,804
Where is he?

150
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:18,307
He's outside working with Dipper.

151
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,768
- He's in a bad mood.
- So am I.

152
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,654
Keep your hands up.

153
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:35,491
Keep your hands up. Watch the right.

154
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:37,242
- Hey, Mick.
- Shut up!

155
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:39,495
To the body. Attaboy.

156
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,625
Time. Time!

157
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,253
What do you want?

158
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,714
- How you feeling today?
- What?

159
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,841
- How you feeling?
- Are you a doctor?

160
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:55,886
- You have problems today?
- Never mind. What's your problem?

161
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:59,973
I been talking to Michael.
How come I been put out of my locker?

162
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:03,435
Because Dipper needed it.
Dipper's a contender.

163
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,729
He's a climber.
Do you know what you are?

164
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:08,106
- You're a tomato.
- Tomato?

165
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,360
I run a business here,
not a goddamn soup kitchen.

166
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,403
- Did you fight last night?
- Yeah.

167
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:16,490
- Did you win?
- Yeah, I won K.O. in the second.

168
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,283
Yeah? Who'd you fight?

169
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,785
Spider Rico.

170
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,537
He's a bum!

171
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:25,749
- You think everybody I fight is a bum.
- Well, ain't they?

172
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,919
You got heart,
but you fight like a goddamn ape.

173
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:32,256
The only thing special about you,
you never got your nose busted.

174
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:36,009
Leave it that way. Nice and pretty
and what's left of your mind.

175
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:38,804
I think I'm gonna go take a steam.
You know why?

176
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,598
Because I did good last night,
and you should've seen me.

177
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,184
- Big deal.
- You should've seen me too.

178
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:45,561
Hey, kid.

179
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:48,480
- You ever think about retiring?
- No.

180
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:50,274
- You think about it.
- Yeah.

181
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,942
All right, time.

182
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,569
- Time!
- What?

183
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:55,779
I dig your locker, man.

184
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,242
Dig your locker.

185
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:03,620
Attaboy.

186
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,861
Cold night.

187
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,865
Whew! Good night to catch
pneumonia, you know?

188
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:45,662
You need some help?

189
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:49,374
There's a good game
at the Spectrum tonight.

190
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:54,338
You wanna go to a basketball game?

191
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:59,259
Hi, Butkus.
Hi, kid.

192
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,806
Tough day today.
They took my locker away.

193
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:07,684
I had that locker for six years.
It don't bother me.

194
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,353
Lockers are bad,
anyway, after a while.

195
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:10,687
People get the combination.

196
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:14,608
I must've had 20 bucks taken out
of there in the past 6 years.

197
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,736
Don't sound like much,
but it adds up.

198
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:19,863
Doesn't matter. Who cares?

199
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,076
Yeah, cold night. Hey, birds.

200
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,870
Hey, look who's here.
Look who's here.

201
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,497
The giant worm.

202
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:33,877
Look at these birds. Don't these
birds look like flying candy?

203
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,796
Bird, you wanna fly me home?

204
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:38,382
You need somebody to walk you home?

205
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:39,800
- No.
- No?

206
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,429
It's a cold night.
If you got the money, take a cab.

207
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:46,682
Too many creeps around here.

208
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,810
Every other block, there's a creep.

209
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,312
You can always tell a creep.

210
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:56,233
Listen. I'm gonna go now, okay?

211
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,026
I'll see you later, all right?

212
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:01,905
None of you guys get up. I know
you had a hard day in the cage.

213
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:03,031
So,

214
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:06,159
I'm gonna go home, make up a joke.
I'll tell you a new joke tomorrow.

215
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:08,036
Okay? Good night, Adrian.

216
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:09,788
Good night, Rocky.

217
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,934
Don't know what happened.

218
00:22:32,144 --> 00:22:35,105
Hey, there, Lefty.
Got a friend for you here.

219
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:37,399
- Hello, Rock.
- How you doing?

220
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:39,651
- You seen Paulie?
- Yeah, he's in the steam room.

221
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:42,612
- Yeah.
- Hey, Rocky. What's with the eye?

222
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:44,614
- Been fighting.
- Hope you won it, at least.

223
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:46,575
Oh, yeah, did real good.
You should've seen me.

224
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:47,826
<i>...heavyweight champion of the world</i>

225
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,619
<i>Apollo Creed at Kennedy Airport...</i>

226
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,788
Hey, Rock, who'd you fight?

227
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,290
Spider Rico.

228
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,625
Jesus. Is he still around?

229
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,879
Yeah, he's doing real good.
He's doing better than you are.

230
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:02,632
Hey, Paulie. What, do you
look the door? Yo, Paulie.

231
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,761
I'd like to kill the freaking moron
who broke the mirror.

232
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,471
Hey, yo, Paulie.

233
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:12,559
Every day, every night, I pass by.
Your sister's giving me the shoulder.

234
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,311
- Forget her.
- What do you mean?

235
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,438
- You can do better than her.
- I don't forget nothing.

236
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,523
Every night I pass by, I tell a joke.

237
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:21,276
Every morning I pass by,
I tell a joke.

238
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:23,403
She just looks at me,
you know what I mean?

239
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:26,448
- Looks?
- Yeah, like I'm a plate of leftovers.

240
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,283
I need a Cadillac
to connect with your sister?

241
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,619
Something wrong with my face?

242
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,288
She's a freaking loser.

243
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,625
Sometimes she gets me so crazy,
I could split her head with a razor.

244
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,628
- Don't get mental.
- You caught me in a bad mood.

245
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:42,506
- You're always in a bad mood.
- Adrian ain't sharp.

246
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,508
Adrian is a loser.

247
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:46,968
She's pushing 30 freaking years old.

248
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,346
If she don't watch out,
she's gonna die alone.

249
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:52,057
- I'm 30 myself.
- And you'll die alone.

250
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,142
I don't see no crowd
around you neither.

251
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,478
I'd like to kill the freaking moron
who broke the mirror.

252
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,189
Come on.
Let's get out of this stink.

253
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,901
- I wanna talk to you anyway.
- About what?

254
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:05,403
- You still work for Gazzo?
- Yeah, sure.

255
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:08,031
Why don't you talk to
him about me?

256
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,201
I just don't think Gazzo's
hiring right now.

257
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:13,870
You know? Come on.

258
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,210
- The girl's dried up.
- Who?

259
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:23,880
My sister. If she don't start living,
her body's gonna dry up.

260
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:26,341
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving,
you know that?

261
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:29,261
- Come over and talk to her.
- Sure. Beer.

262
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,638
Tomorrow you come
for some bird, right?

263
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:33,974
Absolutely. You got it.

264
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:37,435
I gotta go. If I'm ten minutes late,
she calls the hospital.

265
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,854
- Paulie!
- I got it.

266
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:40,564

273
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:59,749
I mean, where are the real fighters
gonna come from? The pros.

274
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:02,210

280
00:25:17,142 --> 00:25:19,102
What else?
Look at him.

This man is champion of the world.

286
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:36,953
He took his best shot
and become champ.

287
00:25:37,621 --> 00:25:39,623
What shot did you ever take?

288
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:42,876
Hey, Rocky, you're not happy
with your life, that's nice.

289
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:46,296
But me, I got a business going.
I don't have to take no shots.

- ...and that was Jake Dale last June...</i>

- Why you getting so insulted?

293
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:58,141
You want me to take a shot?
All right.

294
00:25:58,308 --> 00:25:59,976
I'll take a shot.

295
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:16,034
- Hey, Rocky, how about a bottle?
- No wine, man.

296
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:19,329
- Come on. Just a little.
- Buy us some Thunderbird.

297
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,999
Marie, does your brother know
you're hanging out so late?

298
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,210
- Get lost, creep.
- Screw you, yo-yo!

299
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,337
These guys teach you
to talk like that?

300
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,298
- Stuff it!
- Don't you never say that to me.

301
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,510
You stink up the neighborhood!

302
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,972
You know, you can...

303
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:41,351
When I was your age, only one girl in
the whole neighborhood talked like that.

304
00:26:41,393 --> 00:26:43,311
That was it. Just one.

305
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,564
What are you doing? It'll make
your teeth yellow. Don't do that.

306
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:47,983
I like yellow teeth!

307
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:50,402
- It'll make your breath like garbage.
- Maybe I like garbage.

308
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:52,320
Nobody likes garbage.

309
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:55,198
Anyway, this girl with the dirty
mouth wasn't bad looking,

310
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:57,784
but none of the guys
ever took her serious.

311
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,703
They never took her out
for any serious date.

312
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,371
- Why?
- 'Cause that's the way guys are.

313
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,498
They laugh when you talk dirty.
They think you're cute.

314
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,209
After a while, you get a reputation.
You get no respect.

315
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:08,670
You understand? You get no respect.

316
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:11,423
I gotta use a bad word, whore.

317
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:13,425
You understand? Whore.

318
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:17,512
See? You use dirty words, and maybe
you end up becoming a whore.

319
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,472
Come on, Rocky.
I'm 12.

320
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,933
That don't matter.

321
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:25,103
You don't really have to be one.
Just act like one and that's it.

322
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:28,898
Boom! Bing! You get a bad rep.
You understand?

323
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:32,485
Twenty years from now,
people are gonna say,

324
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:34,904
"Do you remember Marie?"
"No. Who was she?"

325
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,574
"She was the little whore who hung
down at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."

326
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:39,951
"Oh, yeah. Now I remember her."

327
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:43,580
You see, they don't remember you.
They remember the rep.

328
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,206
You understand?

329
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:49,461
You got a boyfriend?
No, you ain't got a boyfriend.

330
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:52,589
You know why? Why don't you
think you have a boyfriend?

331
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:55,467
'Cause you're hanging out with them
coconuts on the corner.

332
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,385
You hang around coconuts,
you get nowhere.

333
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:59,179
They're lemons. Lemons.

334
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:02,307
You hang out with nice people,
you get nice friends. You understand?

335
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,893
You hang out with smart people,
you get smart friends.

336
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:07,479
You hang out with yo-yo people,
you get yo-yo friends.

337
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:09,981
You see, it's simple mathematics.

338
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:12,317
- I hope you ain't...
- I won't.

339
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,485
What was I gonna say?

340
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:16,613
You hope I don't keep acting like a
whore or I'll turn into one, right?

341
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:17,781
Yeah, something like that.

342
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:18,990
Good night, Rocky.

343
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:21,368
- Good night. Take care.
- Hey, Rocky.

344
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:24,120
- Yo.
- Screw you, creep-o!

345
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:34,798
Yeah, who are you to
give advice, creep-o?

346
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:36,299
Who are you?

347
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:58,363
- Are the doctor's reports confirmed?
- Definitely.

348
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:00,490
Says here Mac Lee
Green has suffered

349
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:04,119
"a severely cracked third
metacarpal in his left hand."

350
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:05,954
Damn!

351
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,125
We can cancel the fight indefinitely
if you're set on fighting Green.

352
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,210
Hey, it ain't just Green.

353
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:14,838
What about all the time
Apollo has invested?

354
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:16,589
We can find a solution.

355
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:17,757
Solution nothing.

356
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:20,552
Find me another ranked contender
in a flash, Jergens.

357
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:22,637
Don't play games with my client.

358
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,265
Apollo's already done a million
dollars' worth of publicity,

359
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:28,268
has made contractual obligations
with 20 different organizations.

360
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:30,061
He's not going to be embarrassed!

361
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:32,522
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.

362
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:34,566
Ernie's fighting in
France that same week.

363
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:36,818
Then get me Buddy Shaw.
He's ranked fifth.

364
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,696
Went to California and
gained 50 pounds.

365
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:42,198
I called
every worthwhile contender.

366
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,202
They all say five weeks isn't
enough time to get into shape.

367
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:48,830
Shape nothing, man.
They're afraid.

368
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:50,915
They know everybody
is gonna see this fight.

369
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:52,834
None of them's got
a prayer of whipping me.

370
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:56,921
They're making excuses so they don't
have to be the chump who gets whipped.

371
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:59,632
All I can say is I'm
a good promoter.

372
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:03,303
I've promoted fights
in every goddamn country in the world

373
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:05,555
and I've broken my ass over this one.

374
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,891
I don't know what else to do!

375
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,606
I do.

376
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:20,904
Without a ranked contender,
what this fight needs is a novelty.

377
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:23,823
This is the land of
opportunity, right?

378
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:26,326
So, Apollo Creed,
on January 1st,

379
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:29,496
gives a local underdog fighter
an opportunity.

380
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:34,542
A snow-white underdog, and I'm gonna
put his face on this poster with me.

381
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:36,503
And I'll tell you why.

382
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:38,588
Because I'm sentimental.

383
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:41,633
A lot of other people in this country
are just as sentimental

384
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:44,552
and there's nothing they'd like
better than to see Apollo Creed

385
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:47,764
give a local Philadelphia boy a shot
at the greatest title in the world

386
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:50,141
on this country's biggest birthday.

387
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:52,352
Now that's the way I see it

388
00:30:52,685 --> 00:30:54,938
and that's the way it's gonna be.

389
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:56,689
Apollo, I like it.

390
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,942
It's very American.

391
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:02,612
No, Jergens. It's very smart.

392
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:29,347
- What is it?
- I wanna check this thing out.

393
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:33,226
You said pick up two yards from Snyder
and a grand from Cappoli, right?

394
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:37,397
No, no. Two yards from Cappoli
and a grand from Snyder.

395
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,232
- Two yards.
- Write it down, okay?

396
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:40,900
Yeah, I got it.

397
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:44,362
Who's this girl you're going out with
tomorrow night?

398
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:46,698
- How'd you know?
- I know.

399
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:49,951
Don't you think I hear things? Lot
of canaries flying around the docks.

400
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:52,245
- I'm going out with Paulie's sister.
- Hey, Rocky.

401
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:54,497
- What?
- I hear she's retarded.

402
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:56,791
She ain't retarded.
She's shy, you know?

403
00:31:56,833 --> 00:32:01,421
Tell you what to do. Take her to the zoo.
I hear retards like the zoo.

404
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:03,339
- This bum gotta say that?
- Who you calling a bum?

405
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:05,216
- Back it up, Buddy.
- I'm calling you a bum!

406
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,636
Relax, relax. Buddy's in a bad mood.
It's his prostate.

407
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:11,806
He's always in a bad mood.
You ought to count your blessings.

408
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:13,516
You're still a healthy person.

409
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,852
- I don't like your face.
- I don't like yours either!

410
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:17,979
- Kiss my ass!
- Come out here!

411
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:20,565
Relax! Relax. My ears.

412
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:23,318
Are you driving me crazy?
Both of you.

413
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:26,070
Look. Buddy doesn't like you.

414
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:29,449
Some guys, they just hate
for no reason. <i>Capisce?</i>

415
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:31,200
- Yeah.
- Come here.

416
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:36,039
Here's 50 bucks. You and your girl
Adrian, you have a nice time.

417
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,332
Thanks.

418
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,543
How'd you know her name?

419
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:42,879
You don't think I hear things?

420
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,006
Hey, Rock.
What?

421
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:46,549
- Remember what I told you?
- What'd you tell me?

422
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:47,592
Take her to the zoo.

423
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:49,636
Come on out of the car!

424
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,395
- Some more coffee, Mr. Creed?
- No, thanks, Shirley.

425
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,898
What do you think about Billy Snow?

426
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:03,149
Fouls.

427
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:06,527
How about Big Chuck Smith?

428
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:08,655
No, he's too old and dull.

429
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,740
Hey, that Bobby Judge,
he's a good boy.

430
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,533
No. I don't feel no
heat from that name.

431
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:14,744
Joe Zack's a good prospect.

432
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:18,790
Exactly what are you
looking for, Apollo?

433
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,126
This is what I'm looking for.

434
00:33:22,293 --> 00:33:24,420
The Italian Stallion.

435
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:27,256
Rocky Balboa?
Never heard of him.

436
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:29,759
Look, it's the name, man.

437
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:31,803
The Italian Stallion.

438
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:34,430
The media will eat it up.

439
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:37,308
Who discovered America?
An Italian, right?

440
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:41,145
What would be better than to get
it on with one of his descendants?

441
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:42,730
He's a southpaw.

442
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:44,524
I don't want you messing around
with southpaws.

443
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:46,651
- They do everything backwards.
- Southpaw nothing.

444
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,653
I'll drop him in three.

445
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:53,533
Apollo Creed meets
the Italian Stallion.

446
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:57,453
Sounds like a damn monster movie.

447
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,789
What are you doing with that bat?

448
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:01,499
I used to be deadly
at stickball.

449
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:04,460
- Your sister knows I'm coming?
- She's very excited.

450
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,921
- Look at these swollen hands.
- Yeah.

451
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:10,425
The joints from carrying meat
in and out of the freezer.

452
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:13,720
- Plays hell on the joints.
- Maybe you ought to see a doctor.

453
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,722
I don't need a doctor.
I need a different job.

454
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:18,224
Different job. What kind of turkey?
Big? Small?

455
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:21,644
Talk to Gazzo.
Tell him I'm a good man.

456
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:24,814
Nothing bothers me.
I'd make a great collector.

457
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:26,858
Busting bones don't bother me.

458
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:29,318
Don't bother you. Big turkey, right?

459
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:32,447
Gazzo's gotta give me...
Forget Gazzo. It's a bad job.

460
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:34,031
You got a match?

461
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:36,075
Go to him for me.
As a favor.

462
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,911
Yeah, yeah.
Last time I had a turkey

463
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:42,498
was when they had a two-dollar special
at Horn and Hardart's three years ago.

464
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,042
Last year, me and the
turtles had Spam.

465
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:57,263
- Your sister knows I'm coming?
- Yeah, yeah. She's very excited.

466
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:03,019
Will you forget about Gazzo?

467
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,188
I don't ask nobody twice.

468
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:07,190
Don't ask nobody twice.

469
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:14,655
You're sure your sister
knows I'm coming?

470
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:16,741
Yeah. She's very excited.

471
00:35:20,411 --> 00:35:22,205
Paulie, you're late.

472
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:24,540
You call the hospital?

473
00:35:24,582 --> 00:35:27,710
She calls the hospital
if I'm ten minutes late.

474
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:30,338
Yo, how you doing?

475
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,758
I told you, she's very excited.

476
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:38,721
Why didn't you tell me
you were bringing him here?

477
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:40,389
I'm not ready for this.

478
00:35:40,431 --> 00:35:42,892
Would it make
a difference if you were?

479
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:45,394
- He's taking you out.
- No, I can't.

480
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:49,482
I want you out of
the kitchen right now.

481
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:51,400
I won't.

482
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:58,825
I want you out of
here instamatically!

483
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:01,536
I'm sick of seeing you hanging
around like a freaking spider.

484
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:03,746
Go out and live. Enjoy life!

485
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:05,581
I can't go!

486
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,583
Don't get wise with me now.

487
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:09,418
I'm tired of you being a loser.

488
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,671
Don't call me that, Paulie!

489
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:14,632
<i>Apollo Creed says
he'll be shopping for another victim</i>

490
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:18,511
<i>to fill Green's vacancy for the
Bicentennial championship fight...</i>

491
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:20,263
Why didn't you tell me
you were bringing him home?

492
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:21,639
How do you know I didn't?

493
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:24,600
I can't go, Paulie. I won't go!

494
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:25,768
Why?

495
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:30,231
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.
I got a turkey in the oven.

496
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,942
Oh, a turkey in the oven.

497
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:41,450
Turkey in the oven.

498
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:52,253
You want the bird?
Go in the alley and eat the bird!

499
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:54,297
Aw, Paulie!

500
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:58,301
I want you out of here!
Get out of the house!

501
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:01,095
Go out and enjoy your freaking life!

502
00:37:05,308 --> 00:37:06,976
You hungry, Rock?

503
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:17,320
Hey, yo, Paulie, maybe we better
forget all this, you know?

504
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,990
Forget nothing. Go ahead.
Tell her something funny.

505
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:24,201
Ain't nothing to talk about.
She's in a bad mood. I'm in a bad mood.

506
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:27,079
You can do funny things.
You wanna go out with my sister?

507
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:28,664
- Yeah.
- Well...

508
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,503
I don't know what to say.

509
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:35,796
Funny.

510
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:49,518
Yo, Adrian. It's me, Rocky.

511
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:51,562
Rocky, you know?

512
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:53,481
Listen,

513
00:37:55,775 --> 00:38:00,196
I don't know what to say, 'cause I ain't
never talked to no door before.

514
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:04,617
What do I say to a door?
We better forget this.

515
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:06,118
You're doing fine.

516
00:38:06,202 --> 00:38:08,537
I ain't doing fine.
I look like an idiot.

517
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,623
Keep doing what you're doing. Funny.

518
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:12,875
I know all about these things.

519
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:14,710
I feel like a jerk.

520
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:23,177
Yo, Adrian, it's Rocky again.

521
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:27,848
Listen, I know you ain't too happy
at this moment.

522
00:38:28,391 --> 00:38:30,059
But could you do me a favor?

523
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:33,062
I ain't got nobody
to spend Thanksgiving with.

524
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,565
So, how about maybe you and I

525
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:38,484
go out together,
get something to eat.

526
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:41,112
Maybe laugh a little bit.
Who knows, you know?

527
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:42,947
Would you like to...

528
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,576
Would you like to, maybe,
you and me go out together?

529
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,287
What do you think?
Would you like to?

530
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:57,503
We're gonna have a good time.

531
00:38:57,878 --> 00:39:00,047
We'll have a real good time.

532
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:06,387
Thanks for the bird.

533
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:12,935
I'm gonna turn the TV off.
I got a headache.

534
00:39:25,281 --> 00:39:27,700
- What's your sister like to do?
- Ice-skate.

535
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,785
Adrian, come on.
You're letting the heat out.

536
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:32,163
Who pays the bills around here?

537
00:39:37,752 --> 00:39:40,880
Listen, I don't want no
turkey anyway, you know?

538
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:44,467
But it was Thanksgiving.

539
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:46,427
What?

540
00:39:46,469 --> 00:39:48,471
- It was Thanksgiving.
- Yeah, to you.

541
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:50,848
But to me it's Thursday, right?

542
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:17,875
- It looks kind of quiet.
- I think it's closed.

543
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:21,087
No, I think we're just early
or something like that.

544
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:24,340
- We're closed.
- What?

545
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:27,635
- I said we're closed.
- Yeah. Hey, listen.

546
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:31,055
I'm gonna smooth this guy out.
Wait here. I'll be right back.

547
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:33,057
- We could go someplace else.
- No, it's okay.

548
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:37,103
Are you closed to the general public,
or are you just closed to everybody?

549
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:41,357
It's after 6:00. It's Thanksgiving.
That's why there's nobody here.

550
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,734
Besides, you ain't
supposed to be in here.

551
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:46,320
So do me a favor
and not stay here.

552
00:40:46,362 --> 00:40:49,949
- Could you do me a favor?
- Come on. We're not operating.

553
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:53,035
Look. This girl here
ain't feeling well.

554
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,663
Doctors say she should go out
and exercise.

555
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,873
Ice-skating's probably
the best thing.

556
00:40:57,957 --> 00:40:59,208
So what do you want from me?

557
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,168
Well, hey,
I want you to do me a favor.

558
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,837
You can see she ain't
feeling too good.

559
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:05,923
If you can let her on the ice
for a few minutes, I'd appreciate it.

560
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:07,800
Ten minutes, ten bucks.

561
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:10,052
Ten bucks?
How about eight bucks?

562
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:12,263
Come on. It's Thanksgiving.

563
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:14,390
All right.
Nine bucks, you got a deal.

564
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:17,226
You have the ice to yourself.
Ten bucks.

565
00:41:19,353 --> 00:41:21,105
Give her the blades.

566
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:23,190
Aren't you skating?

567
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:25,234
No,
I ain't skated since I was 15.

568
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,611
That's when I started fighting.

569
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:30,573
Skating's kind of bad for
the ankles, you know?

570
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:34,285
You're a pretty good
skater, aren't you?

571
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:37,580
Like I was saying
before on the way over here,

572
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:40,833
fighting used to be tops with me,
but no more.

573
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:43,419
All I wanted to do out of fighting
was prove I was no bum,

574
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:45,921
that I had the stuff
to make a good pro.

575
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:49,008
- You never got the chance?
- I ain't crying about it.

576
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:51,343
I still fight. I do it like a hobby.

577
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:53,596
The trouble is I'm a southpaw.

578
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:56,599
- What's a southpaw?
- A southpaw means you're left-handed.

579
00:41:56,682 --> 00:41:59,059
A southpaw throws
your timing off.

580
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:01,437
It throws other guys' timing off,
makes them look awkward.

581
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,105
Nobody wants to look awkward.

582
00:42:03,147 --> 00:42:06,358
- You know where "southpaw" came from?
- Nine minutes!

583
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:09,486
A long time ago, there was this guy,
maybe a couple hundred years ago,

584
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:13,032
he was fighting in the...
I think it was around Philadelphia.

585
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:17,077
His arm... He was left-handed.
His arm was facing towards New Jersey.

586
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,998
And that's south. So naturally
they called him "south paw." You see?

587
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:24,376
Southpaw, South Jersey,
South Camden.

588
00:42:24,835 --> 00:42:26,670
Southpaw.
You know what I mean?

589
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,299
Things probably worked out for
the best, don't you think?

590
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:33,052
Never got a chance
because you're left-handed, huh?

591
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:35,221
That's absolutely true,
you know?

592
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:36,555
Watch out.

593
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:41,602
Ah! Ah!
I just dislocated my finger.

594
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:43,479
Ah! Look at that.

595
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,023
Wait. It ain't your fault. Look.

596
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:48,484
See? I had it... It's an old wound.

597
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:50,819
You see that? Look. See?

598
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:52,321
Nothing. It bends like that.

599
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:55,366
I originally done it... Push the button.
Bong. It works.

600
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:58,327
- It ain't your fault. Look.
- Seven minutes!

601
00:42:59,078 --> 00:43:02,081
I originally done it...
I carry pictures of all my fights.

602
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:04,917
I originally done it
in the Baby Crenshaw fight.

603
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,045
Baby's about the size of an
airplane. I broke both hands on his face.

604
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:11,507
I lost that fight, but that's a
nice picture, don't you think?

605
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:12,925
Real nice.

606
00:43:14,385 --> 00:43:16,762
Come on. You having a good time?

607
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:19,390
You can see I ain't too graceful.

608
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:23,852
I don't move well, but I can really swat.
I can really hit hard.

609
00:43:23,936 --> 00:43:27,606
But I'm a southpaw, and nobody
wants to fight no southpaw.

610
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,572
You know how I got
started in fighting?

611
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:36,657
No.

612
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:39,451
Am I talking too loud?

613
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:41,328
Three minutes!

614
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:45,958
My father, he's a...
My old man, he was never too smart.

615
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:48,127
He says to me, "You weren't
born with much of a brain,

616
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:50,713
"so you better start
using your body."

617
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:52,715
So I become a fighter.

618
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:55,134
You know what I mean?

619
00:43:55,217 --> 00:43:57,052
Why you laughing?

620
00:43:58,387 --> 00:44:01,307
My mother, she said
the opposite thing.

621
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,642
What did she say the opposite?

622
00:44:04,268 --> 00:44:06,562
She said, "You weren't
born with much of a body,

623
00:44:06,645 --> 00:44:08,397
"so you better develop your brain."

624
00:44:08,439 --> 00:44:11,233
- Did she say that?
- Yo, time!

625
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:15,404
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely.

626
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:20,075
- Why do you wanna fight?
- 'Cause I can't sing or dance.

627
00:44:20,117 --> 00:44:21,118
Hey, yo.

628
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:23,454
Don't fall!

629
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:27,124
That was terrific.
I'm pretty good at this.

630
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:28,459
You like the way I skate?

631
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:31,587
Last fight I had, I had with
this guy named Spider Rico.

632
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:34,381
He busted my head up there.
You see that scar?

633
00:44:34,465 --> 00:44:37,468
I'll tell you,
things get pretty rough in the ring.

634
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:49,897
You know,
some people are very shy by nature.

635
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:52,191
I suppose.

636
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,988
I say you're very shy
by nature, you know?

637
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:00,616
I suppose.

638
00:45:03,285 --> 00:45:05,037
The bum from the dark.

639
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,789
Get a job, you bum!

640
00:45:07,623 --> 00:45:10,501
Some people think
that being shy is a disease,

641
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:12,544
but it don't bother me none.

642
00:45:12,628 --> 00:45:14,546
Don't bother me either.

643
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:18,008
So Why'd I bother bringing it up?

644
00:45:18,092 --> 00:45:20,260
'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.

645
00:45:21,512 --> 00:45:23,555
I think we make
a sharp couple of coconuts.

646
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:26,475
I'm dumb and you're shy.
What do you think?

647
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:32,314
I don't understand
why anybody would wanna be a fighter.

648
00:45:32,648 --> 00:45:37,945
You gotta be a moron to wanna
be a fighter, you know what I mean?

649
00:45:38,487 --> 00:45:41,990
It's a racket where you're
almost guaranteed to end up a bum.

650
00:45:42,032 --> 00:45:45,494
- I don't think you're a bum.
- I'm at least half a bum.

651
00:45:45,702 --> 00:45:47,871
But I'll tell you something.

652
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:51,333
Worst thing about fighting
is the morning after.

653
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:52,793
- You know?
- Morning after.

654
00:45:52,835 --> 00:45:54,753
Yeah, the morning after a fight,

655
00:45:54,837 --> 00:45:57,381
you're like a large wound,
you know what I mean?

656
00:45:57,464 --> 00:45:59,508
Sometimes I got pains all over me.

657
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:03,303
I feel like calling a taxi to take me
from the bed into the bathroom.

658
00:46:03,345 --> 00:46:05,264
Your hair hurts,
your eyes hurt.

659
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:08,225
Your face is busted up.
Your hands are swollen.

660
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:11,395
Look at this face. Sixty-four fights.
Look at that nose.

661
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:14,231
You see that nose?
That nose ain't never been broken.

662
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:16,650
I had guys busting on it.

663
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:19,778
I had guys chewing on it,
twisting and punching it.

664
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:21,447
I mean, whack, boom.

665
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:24,032
These guys are hitting my nose
all the time.

666
00:46:24,116 --> 00:46:26,076
Never broke it.
I'm very proud of that.

667
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,744
That's rare.

668
00:46:27,828 --> 00:46:30,873
- Why do you do it if it hurts?
- Why you think?

669
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:34,918
'Cause you can't
sing and dance?

670
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,713
Yeah, something like that.

671
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:39,923
Hey, you wanna come inside?

672
00:46:42,259 --> 00:46:43,510
No, I gotta go.

673
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:45,554
Hey, come on.
I got some animals.

674
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:48,056
I got these very rare
animals inside.

675
00:46:48,098 --> 00:46:49,725
Come on in.

676
00:46:49,766 --> 00:46:51,226
No, I gotta go.

677
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:54,146
I gotta go, too,
to the bathroom. Come on.

678
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:55,898
Come on.

679
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:57,733
No, I gotta go.

680
00:46:57,774 --> 00:47:01,445
Look at this face.
Is that a face you could trust or what?

681
00:47:01,737 --> 00:47:05,908
Is it? They ought to stick this face
on a stamp. What do you think?

682
00:47:06,492 --> 00:47:08,076
Come on in.

683
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:15,083
Yo, come on.

684
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:37,022
Click.

685
00:47:42,653 --> 00:47:44,446
Yo, Adrian, you hungry?

686
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:45,906
No.

687
00:47:45,948 --> 00:47:47,658
I got some things in there.

688
00:47:47,741 --> 00:47:50,619
If you like sodas,
doughnuts or something.

689
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:52,955
Got a couple cupcakes.
Huh?

690
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:54,248
No?

691
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:57,125
I got some chocolate in there. No?

692
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:07,719
Hot in here, you know?

693
00:48:09,805 --> 00:48:11,932
I could go for some music.

694
00:48:17,563 --> 00:48:18,981
Yo, Adrian.

695
00:48:19,398 --> 00:48:22,234
These are the exotic animals
I was telling you about.

696
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:24,444
These are my friends, Cuff and Link.

697
00:48:24,486 --> 00:48:27,322
- I sold them to you.
- I know you sold them to me.

698
00:48:27,364 --> 00:48:29,866
Remember you were working
at that pet shop?

699
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:33,412
First day you was there, and I came in
and bought both these animals?

700
00:48:33,495 --> 00:48:34,621
I remember that.

701
00:48:34,663 --> 00:48:38,417
I bought this bowl
and the animals themselves.

702
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,086
Some food, the marbles that
go on the bottom there.

703
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:43,130
Remember that mountain?

704
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:47,384
I had to get rid of that mountain.
They kept fall over and flipping.

705
00:48:50,846 --> 00:48:53,682
Why don't you come over here
and sit down?

706
00:48:55,851 --> 00:48:58,228
It's a nice couch. I don't know.

707
00:49:00,397 --> 00:49:03,525
There's big bugs in there.
It's safer over here.

708
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:07,863
You wanna sit down?

709
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:16,079
These your parents?

710
00:49:16,163 --> 00:49:18,415
Yeah, that's both of them there.

711
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:21,168
- Is this you?
- Yeah. I was eight years old.

712
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:24,379
That's the Italian Stallion
when he was a baby.

713
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:29,718
Come on over.
Make yourself comfortable. Relax.

714
00:49:35,182 --> 00:49:36,475
Do you have a phone?

715
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:38,435
No, I had it pulled.

716
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:40,354
'Cause people calling all the time,

717
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:43,148
and who needs the aggravation, right?

718
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:44,733
Interruptions.

719
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:46,860
Who'd you wanna call?

720
00:49:46,902 --> 00:49:49,655
I wanna let my brother
know where I am.

721
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:51,573
Why?

722
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:54,868
I think he might be worried.

723
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:58,038
I'll call your brother,
if that's the problem.

724
00:50:00,499 --> 00:50:02,751
Yo, Paulie!
Your sister's with me!

725
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:05,462
I'll call you back later!
See you!

726
00:50:12,094 --> 00:50:14,388
You don't like the room,
do you?

727
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:17,432
- It's fine.
- It's only temporary.

728
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,601
It's not that.

729
00:50:24,523 --> 00:50:27,609
What's the problem?
You don't like me?

730
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:29,861
You don't like the turtles?
What's the problem?

731
00:50:29,945 --> 00:50:32,698
- I don't think I belong here.
- It's okay.

732
00:50:35,492 --> 00:50:37,285
I don't belong here.

733
00:50:37,953 --> 00:50:41,248
Well, you know, it's okay,
'cause you're my guest.

734
00:50:42,374 --> 00:50:45,377
I don't know you well enough.

735
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,797
I've never been
in a man's apartment alone.

736
00:50:50,632 --> 00:50:53,468
Well, they're all
the same, you know?

737
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,184
I'm not sure I know you well enough.

738
00:51:02,561 --> 00:51:04,604
I don't feel comfortable.

739
00:51:04,813 --> 00:51:07,649
Yo, Adrian,
I ain't so comfortable either.

740
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:11,611
I should go.

741
00:51:11,653 --> 00:51:13,989
Don't go, please. Don't go.

742
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:17,325
Don't go.

743
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:22,539
Do me a favor.

744
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:23,832
What?

745
00:51:23,915 --> 00:51:25,834
Take off these glasses.

746
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:31,798
You have nice eyes, you know?

747
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:35,427
Do me another favor?

748
00:51:36,428 --> 00:51:38,805
Why don't you take off that hat?

749
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:47,355
I always knew you was pretty.

750
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:51,526
- Don't tease me.
- I'm not teasing you.

751
00:51:54,863 --> 00:51:56,698
I ain't teasing you.

752
00:51:57,741 --> 00:52:00,368
I just wanna...
I wanna kiss you.

753
00:52:03,038 --> 00:52:06,041
You don't have to kiss me back
if you don't wanna,

754
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:07,959
but I wanna kiss you.

755
00:53:20,282 --> 00:53:23,410
- Heard you had a fight coming up.
- Next month.

756
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:25,245
January 27, right?

757
00:53:25,287 --> 00:53:27,289
That's good. Come down to the gym.

758
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:29,624
We'll get you in shape.
How's your weight?

759
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:32,586
- 175.
- Hey, Rock. How you doing?

760
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:34,838
Mick was looking for
you up there, man.

761
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:37,132
- For me? You're sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

762
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:39,342
He's looking for you.
Get up there and see him.

763
00:53:39,426 --> 00:53:41,845
- He wanted me?
- Yeah. Your name's Rock, right?

764
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:43,847
- Yeah.
- All right. Go on, babe.

765
00:53:58,153 --> 00:53:59,988
You got something for me?

766
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:02,908
Yeah, there was some guy
from Miles Jergens looking for you.

767
00:54:02,991 --> 00:54:06,494
They need sparring partners
for Apollo Creed. There's the card.

768
00:54:06,536 --> 00:54:08,246
- When was he here?
- About an hour ago.

769
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:11,625
They're probably looking
for sparring partners for Creed.

770
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:14,169
I said that before,
you dumb Dago!

771
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:18,882
I been coming here for six years, and
six years you been sticking it to me.

772
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:21,509
- How come?
- You don't wanna know!

773
00:54:21,551 --> 00:54:23,345
Yeah, I wanna know how come.

774
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:25,430
- You wanna know?
- I wanna know now!

775
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:27,557
Okay, I'm gonna tell you!

776
00:54:27,641 --> 00:54:31,686
You had the talent to become
a good fighter, and instead of that,

777
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:35,899
you became a leg breaker
for some cheap, second-rate loan shark!

778
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:38,026
It's a living.

779
00:54:38,068 --> 00:54:39,903
It's a waste of life!

780
00:54:58,505 --> 00:55:00,298
Yes. May I help you?

781
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:08,098
Oh, you must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.

782
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:11,059
Mr. Jergens's expecting you.
Just a moment.

783
00:55:16,189 --> 00:55:18,608
Mr. Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.

784
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,276
Fine.

785
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:23,571
- Please go in, Mr. Balboa.
- Can I have that?

786
00:55:23,613 --> 00:55:26,074
- Oh, certainly.
- Thanks.

787
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:32,247
Mr. Balboa.

788
00:55:32,956 --> 00:55:34,749
How are you?
George Jergens.

789
00:55:34,833 --> 00:55:36,459
Take a chair, please.

790
00:55:36,543 --> 00:55:37,752
Thanks.

791
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:41,006
Mr. Balboa.

792
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:43,425
Call me Rocky.

793
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:45,593
Rocky, you got any representation?

794
00:55:45,635 --> 00:55:47,137
You have a manager?

795
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,638
No, just me.

796
00:55:50,265 --> 00:55:54,102
Rocky, I've got a proposition
I'd like to make to you.

797
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:57,689
- About sparring?
- Beg your pardon?

798
00:55:57,772 --> 00:56:02,277
I know you're looking for sparring
partners, and I'm very available.

799
00:56:02,444 --> 00:56:04,279
- I'm sure you are.
- Absolutely.

800
00:56:04,362 --> 00:56:05,864
Sparring with the champ
would be an honor,

801
00:56:05,947 --> 00:56:07,198
and you know what, Mr. Jergens?

802
00:56:07,282 --> 00:56:09,159
- What?
- I wouldn't take no cheap shots.

803
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:11,411
I'd really be a good
sparring partner.

804
00:56:11,453 --> 00:56:13,788
You don't understand me, Rocky.

805
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:16,124
My proposition's this.

806
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:19,335
Would you be interested
in fighting Apollo Creed

807
00:56:19,419 --> 00:56:22,130
for the world heavyweight
championship?

808
00:56:26,718 --> 00:56:27,802
No.

809
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:29,512
Listen, Rocky.

810
00:56:30,472 --> 00:56:32,474
Apollo's seen you fight.

811
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:34,893
He likes you.

812
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:36,728
He wants to fight you.

813
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:38,605
Well, it's just that, you see,

814
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:41,816
I fight in clubs, you know,
and I'm really a ham-and-egger.

815
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,777
This guy, he's the best, and

816
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:47,489
it wouldn't be such a good fight,
but thank you very much.

817
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:49,407
I appreciate it.

818
00:56:49,491 --> 00:56:53,828
Rocky, do you believe that America
is the land of opportunity?

819
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:56,331
Yeah.

820
00:56:57,207 --> 00:56:58,917
Apollo Creed does,

821
00:56:59,292 --> 00:57:01,252
and he's gonna prove
it to the whole world

822
00:57:01,336 --> 00:57:04,047
by giving an unknown
a shot at the title.

823
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:06,549
And that unknown is you.

824
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,135
He picked you, Rocky.

825
00:57:10,345 --> 00:57:12,597
It's the chance of a lifetime.

826
00:57:13,723 --> 00:57:15,683
You can't pass it by.

827
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:17,852
What do you say?

828
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:25,527
<i>All right, fellas.
That's enough pictures.</i>

829
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,487
<i>We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.</i>

830
00:57:27,529 --> 00:57:30,073
<i>Apollo, how do you like
the City of Brotherly Love?</i>

831
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:33,576
<i>Well, just being in
Philadelphia makes me feel patriotic.</i>

832
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,371
<i>Beautiful people in a beautiful city
coming up to me on the street,</i>

833
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:37,664
<i>wishing me the best.</i>

834
00:57:37,705 --> 00:57:40,500
<i>I love my Philadelphia brothers,
and I'm proud to be an American.</i>

835
00:57:40,542 --> 00:57:42,085
<i>Apollo? Champ?</i>

836
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:46,047
<i>Why did you agree to fight a man
who has virtually no chance of winning?</i>

837
00:57:46,089 --> 00:57:48,383
<i>If history proves one thing,</i>

838
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:52,220
<i>American history proves that</i>
<i>everybody's got</i> a <i>chance to win.</i>

839
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:55,431
<i>Didn't you guys ever hear
of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?</i>

840
00:57:55,515 --> 00:57:57,058
<i>Apollo?</i>

841
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,686
<i>It is a coincidence
that you're fighting a white man</i>

842
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:01,729
<i>on the most celebrated day
in the country's history?</i>

843
00:58:01,771 --> 00:58:05,024
<i>I don't know. Is it a coincidence
that he's fighting a black man</i>

844
00:58:05,066 --> 00:58:07,402
<i>on the most celebrated day
in the country's history?</i>

845
00:58:07,485 --> 00:58:09,487
<i>- Right on, Apollo!
- Tell the truth, brother!</i>

846
00:58:09,571 --> 00:58:12,157
<i>Listen, Apollo. How
do you feel about your challenger?</i>

847
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,993
<i>How do I feel about him?
Come here, Rock.</i>

848
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:16,786
<i>My main man.</i>

849
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:19,581
<i>- Rocky, ain't you Italian?
- Yeah, I'm Italian.</i>

850
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:21,374
<i>Now what does that mean?</i>

851
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:24,294
<i>That means, if he can't fight,
I'll bet he can cook.</i>

852
00:58:26,004 --> 00:58:28,590
Do me a favor. His lungs, punch out.

853
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:30,091
Paulie.

854
00:58:30,133 --> 00:58:33,386
<i>Rocky, how do you expect
to fight Apollo Creed?</i>

855
00:58:33,928 --> 00:58:36,139
<i>Oh, jeez, you know,
Creed's the best.</i>

856
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:37,932
<i>I guess I'll have to do
the best I can.</i>

857
00:58:37,974 --> 00:58:40,643
<i>Tell me, Rocky, just between us,</i>

858
00:58:40,727 --> 00:58:43,771
<i>where did you get
the name "Italian Stallion"?</i>

859
00:58:43,855 --> 00:58:48,276
<i>Oh, I invented that about eight
years ago when I was eating dinner.</i>

860
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:53,156
<i>Rocky, now your payday
will be $150, 000.</i>

861
00:58:53,281 --> 00:58:54,699
<i>Any comment?</i>

862
00:58:56,951 --> 00:58:59,829
<i>- You got no comment, Rocky, right?
- No.</i>

863
00:58:59,913 --> 00:59:01,372
<i>- Thank you, Rocky.
- Wait a minute.</i>

864
00:59:01,456 --> 00:59:04,375
<i>I just wanna say hi to
my girlfriend, okay?</i>

865
00:59:04,459 --> 00:59:06,586
<i>Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky.</i>

866
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:10,465
<i>You believe all this?
Microphones and all that stuff.</i>

867
00:59:10,506 --> 00:59:11,633
You didn't.

868
00:59:11,716 --> 00:59:14,052
<i>- Thank you, Rocky.
- Who you pushing, man?</i>

869
00:59:14,135 --> 00:59:16,471
<i>- Smack you in the mouth!
- Thank you, Rocky.</i>

870
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:18,473
Don't it matter he making
you out a fool?

871
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:20,141
I'd break his lips.

872
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:23,853
- He's taking cheap shots.
- Don't bother me none.

873
00:59:23,937 --> 00:59:28,775
Yo, Rocky, I guess you'll be looking
for people to help you out.

874
00:59:28,816 --> 00:59:30,151
Help what?

875
00:59:30,193 --> 00:59:31,444
You know,

876
00:59:31,486 --> 00:59:33,446
keep you living the clean life.

877
00:59:33,488 --> 00:59:35,782
I do okay, you know.

878
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:37,825
You need someone
to help with the exercise

879
00:59:37,867 --> 00:59:41,746
and someone standing by with a towel
or running errands?

880
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:44,582
Hey, yo, Paulie,
who cared about me yesterday? Nobody.

881
00:59:44,666 --> 00:59:47,252
So I just think I'm gonna
train myself, you know?

882
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:49,504
Without such good people around
to help you,

883
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:52,006
you don't have such a good chance.

884
00:59:52,173 --> 00:59:54,717
Einstein flunked out
of school twice.

885
00:59:55,051 --> 00:59:56,302
That so?

886
00:59:56,469 --> 01:00:00,348
Yeah. Beethoven was deaf.
Helen Keller was blind.

887
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:03,351
I think Rocky's got a good chance.

888
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:11,150
Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?

889
01:00:11,192 --> 01:00:14,988
You looking to do a good deed?
Keep out of my freaking life!

890
01:00:15,863 --> 01:00:17,740
- What'd I do?
- Nothing.

891
01:00:17,824 --> 01:00:19,409
Did I say something wrong?

892
01:00:19,492 --> 01:00:21,244
You didn't say nothing.
It's all right.

893
01:00:21,327 --> 01:00:23,371
That's right!
You didn't say nothing!

894
01:00:23,413 --> 01:00:24,998
Nothing at all!

895
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,376
I gotta go.

896
01:00:29,544 --> 01:00:31,921
Where are the freaking pretzels?

897
01:00:35,008 --> 01:00:36,926
I'd like to have a pretzel.

898
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:39,137
Hey, we ain't got any beer?

899
01:00:40,013 --> 01:00:43,182
I thought you were supposed to
pick up some beer!

900
01:00:51,024 --> 01:00:53,609
How'd you like hearing your name
on TV tonight?

901
01:00:55,403 --> 01:00:56,904
I was shocked.

902
01:00:56,946 --> 01:00:58,406
Why'd you do that?

903
01:00:58,448 --> 01:01:00,241
You're putting me on, right?

904
01:01:00,283 --> 01:01:01,701
Absolutely.

905
01:01:02,452 --> 01:01:05,246
- What time should I expect you?
- About 7:00.

906
01:01:05,288 --> 01:01:07,248
- Okay.
- Hey.

907
01:01:24,766 --> 01:01:28,227
You know how I said
that stuff on TV didn't bother me?

908
01:01:28,603 --> 01:01:29,604
Yeah.

909
01:01:32,231 --> 01:01:33,483
It did.

910
01:01:44,118 --> 01:01:47,747
Listen, the reason I brought
you here is because

911
01:01:47,789 --> 01:01:50,124
I wanna know if you got any money
for training expenses.

912
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:51,959
I got a few dollars.

913
01:01:52,043 --> 01:01:54,295
A few bucks? Here.
Put this in your glove.

914
01:01:54,379 --> 01:01:57,465
- What's this?
- $500. Don't worry about it.

915
01:01:58,674 --> 01:02:00,635
You know, you ain't
never had any luck,

916
01:02:00,676 --> 01:02:03,179
but I think this time Lady Luck
may be in your corner.

917
01:02:03,262 --> 01:02:06,224
- What do you think?
- Maybe.

918
01:02:06,307 --> 01:02:08,226
Thanks for the money, Tony.

919
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:11,396
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
I'll see you.

920
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:13,481
- Wait a minute.
- What?

921
01:02:13,523 --> 01:02:15,650
You're in training.
Come on.

922
01:02:23,825 --> 01:02:25,451
- Yo, Tony.
- What?

923
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:28,579
You gonna show up at the fight?

924
01:02:28,663 --> 01:02:29,956
Ringside.

925
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:33,835
I'll see you.

926
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,121
Yeah.

927
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:19,213
Hello, kid. I seen your light.
Can I come in?

928
01:03:19,297 --> 01:03:21,591
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah. Good.

929
01:03:21,674 --> 01:03:23,801
Hey, it's a nice place here.

930
01:03:24,594 --> 01:03:27,388
Anyway, what I come
to tell you is that,

931
01:03:28,764 --> 01:03:32,059
that what happened to
you is freak luck.

932
01:03:32,101 --> 01:03:34,061
- Yeah, freak luck.
- Ain't it true?

933
01:03:34,103 --> 01:03:36,647
Look at the other guys.
They're good fighters, right?

934
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:39,400
They're colorful.
They got good records.

935
01:03:39,484 --> 01:03:41,819
They fight their guts
out for peanuts.

936
01:03:41,903 --> 01:03:45,865
But you, you got
a shot at the title!

937
01:03:45,907 --> 01:03:48,409
Freak luck is a strange thing,
you know?

938
01:03:48,451 --> 01:03:50,995
- Sure is. Can I sit down?
- Yeah, sure.

939
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:55,708
- What the hell are those?
- Domestic turtles.

940
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:58,294
The one on the top is Cuff
and the other guy's Link.

941
01:03:58,377 --> 01:03:59,587
The rest are marbles.

942
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:02,048
Yeah?
They make good soup.

943
01:04:02,757 --> 01:04:03,925
Anyway.

944
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:06,928
Look, I'm here to warn you.

945
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:11,516
You gotta be very careful about this
shot that you got at the title.

946
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,393
Because, like the Bible says,

947
01:04:14,435 --> 01:04:16,604
you ain't gonna get a second chance.

948
01:04:16,687 --> 01:04:18,814
Yeah. All right.

949
01:04:18,898 --> 01:04:20,816
You thought of that, huh?

950
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:24,320
Well, what you need is a manager.

951
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:27,365
A manager. Listen to me.

952
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:31,160
I know, because I been
in this racket for 50 years.

953
01:04:31,244 --> 01:04:34,539
- 50 years, huh?
- 50 years. I've seen it all.

954
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:37,959
- All of it. You know what I done?
- What?

955
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,002
I have done it all.

956
01:04:40,086 --> 01:04:43,881
You should've seen me when I knocked
Ginny Russell out of the ring.

957
01:04:43,965 --> 01:04:45,883
Out of the goddamn ring, I tell you.

958
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:47,969
September 14, 1923,

959
01:04:48,052 --> 01:04:52,431
and it was the same night that Firpo
knocks Dempsey out of the ring.

960
01:04:52,473 --> 01:04:54,892
So who gets the publicity?
Figure that out.

961
01:04:54,976 --> 01:04:56,894
- Dempsey.
- That's right. But why?

962
01:04:56,978 --> 01:05:00,815
- 'Cause he was champ.
- No! Because he had a manager.

963
01:05:00,982 --> 01:05:02,483
I had nothing.

964
01:05:03,859 --> 01:05:06,362
I wanna show you something.
I want you to look at my face.

965
01:05:06,445 --> 01:05:09,782
Look at this. I got 21
stitches over this left eye.

966
01:05:09,824 --> 01:05:12,326
I got 34 stitches over this eye.

967
01:05:12,368 --> 01:05:15,830
You know I had my
nose busted 17 times.

968
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:20,501
The last time
was in that fight with Sailor Mike.

969
01:05:20,543 --> 01:05:23,504
I got that clipping here.
It was a good fight.

970
01:05:23,546 --> 01:05:25,506
Wanna read that?

971
01:05:25,548 --> 01:05:27,675
Well, it doesn't matter.

972
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:31,262
Anyway, he put this
vegetation on my ear.

973
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:40,688
You kind of remind me of the Rock,
you know that?

974
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:42,815
- You really think so?
- That's right.

975
01:05:42,857 --> 01:05:46,277
You move like him,
and you got heart like he did.

976
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,947
Yeah, I got heart, but I ain't
got no locker, do I, Mick?

977
01:05:53,784 --> 01:05:55,536
Anyway.

978
01:05:55,578 --> 01:05:58,706
You know, when I begun
in this business, kid...

979
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:04,962
I wanna make a suggestion.
Don't drink that piss before a fight.

980
01:06:05,046 --> 01:06:07,173
It's no good for you.

981
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,634
If you don't mind my saying.

982
01:06:09,717 --> 01:06:11,927
Anyway, you know,
when I started in this racket,

983
01:06:12,011 --> 01:06:14,221
pugs like us, we was
treated like dogs.

984
01:06:14,305 --> 01:06:16,724
For $10, you got to
tear somebody's throat out.

985
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:19,060
But I never had no management.

986
01:06:20,436 --> 01:06:23,439
One time, this son of a
bitch that I fought,

987
01:06:23,522 --> 01:06:25,483
he put a nail right there.

988
01:06:25,566 --> 01:06:27,902
- In his thumb.
- In the thumb of the glove.

989
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:33,074
He punched so many holes in my face,
I had spit shooting out of my cheeks.

990
01:06:33,658 --> 01:06:35,451
Can you imagine that?

991
01:06:35,534 --> 01:06:39,080
Anyway, when I tell you what I
looked like when I was in my prime.

992
01:06:39,163 --> 01:06:40,915
I want you to look at something.

993
01:06:40,998 --> 01:06:43,626
Look at that.
That's the way I looked

994
01:06:44,585 --> 01:06:46,712
before these guys got at me.

995
01:06:46,754 --> 01:06:50,549
That's nice. You didn't take very
good care of the picture, though.

996
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:53,844
Well, I never had no management.

997
01:06:53,928 --> 01:06:56,138
That's the trouble,
but now I got all this knowledge.

998
01:06:56,222 --> 01:06:58,974
I got it up here.
Now I wanna give it to you.

999
01:06:59,058 --> 01:07:01,769
I wanna give you this knowledge.
I wanna take care of you.

1000
01:07:01,811 --> 01:07:05,064
I wanna make sure that what happened
to me doesn't happen to you.

1001
01:07:05,106 --> 01:07:06,941
You know what I mean?

1002
01:07:06,982 --> 01:07:08,818
Mick, the fight's set.

1003
01:07:08,901 --> 01:07:11,529
Listen to me.
I wanna be your manager.

1004
01:07:11,612 --> 01:07:12,988
You follow that?

1005
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:15,282
Fight's set.
I don't need no manager.

1006
01:07:15,366 --> 01:07:17,743
But you can't buy
what I'm gonna give you.

1007
01:07:17,785 --> 01:07:20,204
I got pain and I got experience.

1008
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:22,790
I got pain and I got experience too.

1009
01:07:23,499 --> 01:07:24,959
Listen, kid.

1010
01:07:25,126 --> 01:07:26,669
Hey, Mick.

1011
01:07:26,752 --> 01:07:29,380
I needed your help
about 10 years ago, right?

1012
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:32,466
Ten years ago. You never helped me none.
You didn't care.

1013
01:07:32,508 --> 01:07:34,343
If you wanted help...

1014
01:07:34,969 --> 01:07:39,014
I say, if you wanted help,
why didn't you just ask me, kid?

1015
01:07:39,098 --> 01:07:41,684
I asked,
but you never heard nothing!

1016
01:07:42,643 --> 01:07:43,978
Well, I...

1017
01:07:47,273 --> 01:07:48,649
know I..

1018
01:07:48,691 --> 01:07:50,359
I'm 76 years old.

1019
01:07:55,114 --> 01:07:56,323
And...

1020
01:08:31,817 --> 01:08:34,236
Took you long enough to get here.

1021
01:08:34,987 --> 01:08:37,198
Took 10 years to
come to my house.

1022
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:39,241
You don't like my house?

1023
01:08:39,992 --> 01:08:41,535
My house stink?

1024
01:08:42,703 --> 01:08:44,705
That's right, it stinks!

1025
01:08:44,789 --> 01:08:47,124
I didn't
ask no favors from you!

1026
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:52,046
Talk about your prime.

1027
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:54,423
What about my prime, Mick?

1028
01:08:54,715 --> 01:08:56,675
At least you had a prime!

1029
01:08:57,384 --> 01:08:59,595
I ain't had no prime.
I ain't had nothing.

1030
01:08:59,678 --> 01:09:02,681
Legs are going, everything is going.
Nobody's giving me nothing.

1031
01:09:02,723 --> 01:09:04,934
Guy comes up, offers me a fight.
Big deal.

1032
01:09:05,017 --> 01:09:07,520
Wanna fight the fight?
Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.

1033
01:09:07,561 --> 01:09:11,190
I'm gonna go fight that big fight
and I'm gonna get that!

1034
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:13,359
I'm gonna get that!

1035
01:09:14,568 --> 01:09:16,695
And you wanna be
ringside and see?

1036
01:09:16,737 --> 01:09:18,823
Do you?
You wanna help me out?

1037
01:09:18,906 --> 01:09:21,659
Do you wanna see me
get my face kicked in?

1038
01:09:21,742 --> 01:09:23,744
Legs ain't working,
nothing's working.

1039
01:09:23,786 --> 01:09:26,247
Think I'll go and fight the champ.

1040
01:09:26,747 --> 01:09:28,541
Yeah, I'll fight him.

1041
01:09:30,918 --> 01:09:32,837
Get my face kicked in.

1042
01:09:33,712 --> 01:09:36,257
And you come around here.
You wanna move in with me?

1043
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,592
Come on in.
It's a nice house!

1044
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:41,929
Real nice! Come on in! It stinks!

1045
01:09:43,222 --> 01:09:45,224
This whole place stinks.

1046
01:09:45,641 --> 01:09:47,560
You wanna help me out?

1047
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:51,772
Well, help me out! Come on.
Help me out. I'm standing here!

1048
01:10:51,498 --> 01:10:54,501
<i>It's only about
28 degrees. We'll check that forecast.</i>

1049
01:10:54,585 --> 01:10:57,504
<i>I feel very mischievous,
very weird, very...</i>

1050
01:10:58,839 --> 01:11:01,133
<i>I got vinyl seats in my car.</i>

1051
01:11:01,175 --> 01:11:04,303
<i>When I hit those seats this morning,
I just went, "Whoo!"</i>

1052
01:11:04,345 --> 01:11:08,641
<i>I figure if I'm up, everybody
in the Delaware Valley should be up.</i>

1053
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:10,017
<i>You agree with me?</i>

1054
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:13,979
<i>At three minutes past 4:00 in
the morning, what else you gonna do?</i>

1055
01:11:15,481 --> 01:11:16,649
<i>Hello?</i>

1056
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:20,277
<i>Good morning, Mrs. Kramer. This
is Don Cabot, VINBG Philadelphia?</i>

1057
01:11:20,361 --> 01:11:22,571
<i>- How are you this morning?
- What?</i>

1058
01:11:22,655 --> 01:11:26,533
<i>You have a lot of nerve calling
me at this hour of the morning!</i>

1059
01:11:26,617 --> 01:11:27,910
<i>Good-bye!</i>

1060
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:43,759
<i>Me and Mrs. Kramer are up,
and it's a good morning.</i>

1061
01:11:43,842 --> 01:11:46,512
<i>I tell you, I need someone
to snuggle with. 28 degrees.</i>

1062
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:48,639
<i>It's cold out there.
We deserve it.</i>

1063
01:11:48,722 --> 01:11:51,183
<i>We've been getting away with
murder the last couple of weeks.</i>

1064
01:11:51,225 --> 01:11:53,352
<i>Our high today could be...</i>

1065
01:11:53,394 --> 01:11:56,271
<i>Tonight we 're back down
in the 20-degree range.</i>

1066
01:11:56,355 --> 01:11:57,898
<i>A little colder in the suburbs.</i>

1067
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:01,151
<i>Tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,
we may hit 40.</i>

1068
01:12:01,235 --> 01:12:03,195
<i>But it's 28.
It's awfully chilly.</i>

1069
01:12:03,237 --> 01:12:05,990
<i>Make sure you have it bundled up
before you bring it out.</i>

1070
01:14:28,132 --> 01:14:29,383
Come on.

1071
01:14:30,384 --> 01:14:32,928
It stinks in here, you know?

1072
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:34,847
Yeah. I know.

1073
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,892
Did you kill all these things?

1074
01:14:39,518 --> 01:14:41,395
No, across the street.

1075
01:14:43,397 --> 01:14:46,191
It's like an animal morgue.

1076
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:48,485
It's a little cold in here, ain't it?

1077
01:14:48,569 --> 01:14:49,695
Yeah.

1078
01:14:54,199 --> 01:14:56,368
Who killed all these things?

1079
01:14:56,827 --> 01:14:58,495
Are you crazy, Paulie?

1080
01:14:58,579 --> 01:15:00,831
If you don't pay Gazzo,
you end up on a hook.

1081
01:15:00,914 --> 01:15:03,083
Gazzo's a good man.
You know that.

1082
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:04,960
Don't get excited.
I know that.

1083
01:15:05,043 --> 01:15:08,964
That's why I wanted you to talk to
him about me and the collecting job.

1084
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:11,592
I can get me out of
this stinking freezer.

1085
01:15:11,633 --> 01:15:15,637
Why don't you do yourself a favor?
Keep this job. You eat better.

1086
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:18,098
Moo.

1087
01:15:18,724 --> 01:15:20,809
Does it ever snow in here?

1088
01:15:21,602 --> 01:15:25,772
You and my sister,
how you getting along together?

1089
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:28,358
How do you think?

1090
01:15:28,942 --> 01:15:31,528
I'm not sure, Rock.
What's the story?

1091
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:33,947
About what?

1092
01:15:34,156 --> 01:15:35,824
What's happening?

1093
01:15:36,658 --> 01:15:38,368
You really like her?

1094
01:15:38,452 --> 01:15:40,120
Sure, I like her.

1095
01:15:42,164 --> 01:15:44,833
I don't see it.
What's the attraction?

1096
01:15:45,876 --> 01:15:48,670
I don't know.
Fills gaps, I guess.

1097
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:50,923
What's "gaps"?

1098
01:15:51,256 --> 01:15:55,260
I don't know. She's got gaps.
I got gaps. Together we fill gaps.

1099
01:15:57,721 --> 01:15:59,348
You balling her?

1100
01:15:59,806 --> 01:16:00,807
Hey.

1101
01:16:01,516 --> 01:16:04,269
You don't talk dirty
about your sister.

1102
01:16:06,104 --> 01:16:08,232
Are you screwing my sister?

1103
01:16:10,692 --> 01:16:14,154
You see? That's why I can't
connect you with Gazzo.

1104
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:17,574
Because you got a big mouth.
You just talk too much.

1105
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:21,495
- It's cold in here. I'm going home.
- Cold in here?

1106
01:16:21,578 --> 01:16:23,163
It is cold in here!

1107
01:16:23,247 --> 01:16:25,666
It stinks in here,
and you stink!

1108
01:16:54,236 --> 01:16:56,280
You're breaking the ribs.

1109
01:17:15,674 --> 01:17:19,720
If you do that to Apollo Creed,
they'll put us in jail for murder.

1110
01:17:21,513 --> 01:17:24,057
I'll see you tomorrow
morning, okay?

1111
01:17:36,778 --> 01:17:39,072
- I turned the heat up.
- Thanks.

1112
01:17:39,448 --> 01:17:43,410
Your brother's a good man,
but he's awful pushy, you know?

1113
01:17:53,712 --> 01:17:56,757
- You want me to rub you down?
- No, I'm just sore, okay?

1114
01:17:56,798 --> 01:17:59,092
- I'm gonna just sit here.
- You sure?

1115
01:17:59,134 --> 01:18:00,594
Yeah, I'm sure.

1116
01:18:04,264 --> 01:18:07,100
Hey, come on.
No fooling around, all right?

1117
01:18:07,434 --> 01:18:08,769
I'm tired.

1118
01:18:09,686 --> 01:18:11,605
Adrian, I'm serious now.

1119
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:13,607
There's no fooling
around during training.

1120
01:18:13,648 --> 01:18:15,442
I wanna stay strong.

1121
01:18:15,776 --> 01:18:18,612
- You're not kidding.
- No, I ain't kidding.

1122
01:18:21,615 --> 01:18:23,575
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1123
01:18:23,617 --> 01:18:26,328
Why don't you just
make the meat, okay?

1124
01:18:28,205 --> 01:18:30,248
Okay, I'll make the meat.

1125
01:18:56,817 --> 01:18:58,735
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

1126
01:18:59,778 --> 01:19:00,779
Hey.

1127
01:19:31,476 --> 01:19:34,396
Underneath! Underneath!
Knock him out! Come on!

1128
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:36,565
Hold it. Hold it, Rock!

1129
01:19:36,648 --> 01:19:40,694
You're driving me crazy. You're so
sloppy because you're off balance.

1130
01:19:40,735 --> 01:19:42,696
Let's try this. Take this string.

1131
01:19:42,737 --> 01:19:44,364
Tie it to both ankles.

1132
01:19:44,406 --> 01:19:47,534
- Leave about two feet of slack.
- I never had good footwork.

1133
01:19:47,576 --> 01:19:50,203
Never mind footwork.
Now you're all balanced.

1134
01:19:50,245 --> 01:19:52,747
Marciano had the same problem

1135
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:55,041
and this string cured it.

1136
01:19:55,542 --> 01:20:00,422
If you can move and hit without
breaking the string, you got balance!

1137
01:20:00,505 --> 01:20:02,799
You become a dangerous person.

1138
01:20:02,883 --> 01:20:04,885
- You follow me?
- Looking good, Rock.

1139
01:20:04,926 --> 01:20:07,012
- Thanks.
- Let's go. That's it.

1140
01:20:07,053 --> 01:20:09,014
- Underneath it.
- Hey, Rock.

1141
01:20:09,055 --> 01:20:11,183
- What?
- How about an autograph?

1142
01:20:11,224 --> 01:20:12,684
Get out of here!

1143
01:20:12,726 --> 01:20:15,562
Don't interrupt me
while I'm conducting business.

1144
01:20:15,604 --> 01:20:17,898
Move your little chicken asses out.

1145
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:22,194
Hey, listen, kid.
You lay off that pet shop dame.

1146
01:20:22,569 --> 01:20:24,946
Women weaken legs.

1147
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:28,533
Yeah, but I really like
this girl, you know?

1148
01:20:28,575 --> 01:20:30,494
Then let her train you!

1149
01:20:33,121 --> 01:20:35,081
Okay, no more fooling around.

1150
01:20:35,165 --> 01:20:36,833
Okay. Now hit it.

1151
01:20:38,502 --> 01:20:40,754
Women weaken legs, huh?

1152
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:47,052
- Yo, Rock.
- Yo, Rocky.

1153
01:20:57,562 --> 01:20:59,105
You look great.

1154
01:21:00,232 --> 01:21:02,067
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

1155
01:21:02,275 --> 01:21:04,778
Terrific.
I mean, you could be a heartbreak.

1156
01:21:04,819 --> 01:21:07,614
You'll walk down the street
breaking hearts the way you're looking.

1157
01:21:07,697 --> 01:21:08,782
Very sharp.

1158
01:21:09,366 --> 01:21:11,451
I got another surprise for you.

1159
01:21:11,535 --> 01:21:12,619
What?

1160
01:21:13,328 --> 01:21:15,914
Butkus! Hey, Butkus.

1161
01:21:15,956 --> 01:21:17,916
Come here, kid.

1162
01:21:17,958 --> 01:21:20,335
To keep you company when you run.

1163
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:28,343
Come in and meet the family.
The owner never come back?

1164
01:21:28,426 --> 01:21:30,387
Gloria says he's yours
if you want him.

1165
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:33,181
Do I want him? What's he eat?

1166
01:21:33,265 --> 01:21:35,141
He eats little turtles.

1167
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:01,543
What's that, Butkus?

1168
01:22:01,626 --> 01:22:03,712
Whose truck is this? Come on.

1169
01:22:06,047 --> 01:22:08,675
One call from me, you're a celebrity.

1170
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,220
You got... Need exposure.

1171
01:22:12,304 --> 01:22:14,556
- Don't breathe on me.
- That's the big time.

1172
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,266
Don't I know about these things?

1173
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:18,518
You don't know nothing.
What do they want from me?

1174
01:22:18,602 --> 01:22:20,270
To watch you train.

1175
01:22:20,353 --> 01:22:23,064
What is the matter with you?
This is supposed to be private.

1176
01:22:23,148 --> 01:22:25,567
- I'm doing you a favor.
- You ain't doing me no favors!

1177
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:27,569
You're embarrassing me
in front of everybody.

1178
01:22:27,652 --> 01:22:29,654
You'll make me look bad
in front of your sis...

1179
01:22:29,696 --> 01:22:32,032
See this cigar?
I'm gonna stick it in your ear.

1180
01:22:32,073 --> 01:22:35,201
Don't do these things to me.
You should've called me.

1181
01:22:35,285 --> 01:22:37,621
Leave a message.
Don't do that.

1182
01:22:38,288 --> 01:22:40,415
My sister really likes you.

1183
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:43,960
I'm gonna kill you one
of these days!

1184
01:22:44,044 --> 01:22:45,295
Come on.

1185
01:22:45,378 --> 01:22:47,088
- Baby!
- Baby.

1186
01:22:47,714 --> 01:22:51,426
Here he is, the next heavyweight
champion of the world, Rocky Balboa!

1187
01:22:51,509 --> 01:22:53,428
Hello there. Rocky Balboa.

1188
01:22:53,511 --> 01:22:55,430
We wanna get a brief
interview with you.

1189
01:22:55,513 --> 01:22:57,390
- What about me?
- What about you?

1190
01:22:57,432 --> 01:22:59,768
- I'm in charge of the meat.
- Fine. Stand behind it.

1191
01:22:59,851 --> 01:23:01,895
Settle yourself down.
Relax.

1192
01:23:01,936 --> 01:23:04,814
What we're going to do
is ask you a few questions.

1193
01:23:04,898 --> 01:23:07,442
Just a few questions
about your unique training method.

1194
01:23:07,525 --> 01:23:09,361
Talk to the folks at home.

1195
01:23:09,402 --> 01:23:11,446
They really wanna know
how you got into this.

1196
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:14,199
This isn't an everyday thing.
Jimmy, you guys ready?

1197
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,409
Let's roll it.
Rocky, turn around here.

1198
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:18,328
Just don't take no
cheap shots, you know?

1199
01:23:18,411 --> 01:23:20,372
No, I won't do that.
Just relax.

1200
01:23:20,413 --> 01:23:23,917
Today we're here with
heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.

1201
01:23:23,958 --> 01:23:25,627
The reason we're standing in this...

1202
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:28,254
The meat guy's sticking his face in.

1203
01:23:28,296 --> 01:23:30,382
Let's try it again, Rocky.

1204
01:23:31,216 --> 01:23:34,260
<i>Today we 're here with
heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.</i>

1205
01:23:34,344 --> 01:23:36,930
<i>The reason we 're standing
in this refrigerated box</i>

1206
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:40,183
<i>is that Mr. Balboa
has an unusual method of training.</i>

1207
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:43,770
<i>In a moment, he'll demonstrate that
for the viewing audience at home.</i>

1208
01:23:43,812 --> 01:23:47,440
<i>But first, Rocky, how did you
come to train in an Icebox?</i>

1209
01:23:48,066 --> 01:23:50,860
<i>Well, my friend,
the guy over there,</i>

1210
01:23:50,944 --> 01:23:53,780
<i>he let me in one day,
and I hit the beef here and liked it,</i>

1211
01:23:53,863 --> 01:23:57,283
<i>and since I've become a challenger,
the owner don't mind that I come in.</i>

1212
01:23:57,325 --> 01:24:01,246
<i>Is this a common training method?
Do other fighters pound raw meat?</i>

1213
01:24:01,287 --> 01:24:03,289
<i>No, I think I invented it.</i>

1214
01:24:03,331 --> 01:24:06,084
<i>- Would you give us a demonstration?
- Confirm the reservation</i>

1215
01:24:06,126 --> 01:24:09,629
for my people at ringside,
and fly my barber to Philly.

1216
01:24:13,049 --> 01:24:16,094
How much is being channeled into
West Coast closed-circuit advertising?

1217
01:24:16,136 --> 01:24:18,471
- 300,000.
- Make it 450.

1218
01:24:18,513 --> 01:24:20,974
And send the mayor's wife
200 roses from me,

1219
01:24:21,015 --> 01:24:23,810
and make sure we get a picture of it
for all the newspapers.

1220
01:24:23,852 --> 01:24:26,938
Do you want to run the 15
radio spots in the Midwest?

1221
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:29,607
You can spend your money better
in Canadian publicity.

1222
01:24:29,649 --> 01:24:32,402
By the way, Apollo,
I've got friends in Toronto

1223
01:24:32,485 --> 01:24:34,446
who can get you a good tax break.

1224
01:24:34,487 --> 01:24:36,656
George, I like your friends.

1225
01:24:44,664 --> 01:24:49,043
Hey, Champ. You ought to come look at
this boy you're gonna fight on TV.

1226
01:24:49,711 --> 01:24:52,922
- Looks like he means business.
- Yeah, I mean business too.

1227
01:24:53,006 --> 01:24:55,175
Shirley,
we got any more coffee out there?

1228
01:24:55,216 --> 01:24:57,844
Certainly, Mr. Creed.
I'll get you some right away.

1229
01:24:57,927 --> 01:25:01,181
After the fight,
I may retire and run for emperor.

1230

<i>Diana Lewis in the meat house</i>

1231
01:25:18,072 --> 01:25:20,533
<i>with southpaw Rocky Balboa.</i>

1232
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,998
And he called the reporters?

1233
01:26:09,082 --> 01:26:11,668
Yeah. Threw my
training schedule off.

1234
01:26:11,751 --> 01:26:13,878
Don't be mad at him.
He's trying to help.

1235
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,755
Adrian, I ain't mad,

1236
01:26:15,839 --> 01:26:19,092
it's just that when reporters are
around, I get out of joint

1237
01:26:19,133 --> 01:26:22,428
'cause they take cheap shots,
and Paulie knows that.

1238
01:26:22,762 --> 01:26:25,849
And Paulie keeps asking me
for a job all the time

1239
01:26:25,932 --> 01:26:28,685
but he don't know nothing
about fighting.

1240
01:26:28,768 --> 01:26:31,229
Are you gonna say
anything to him?

1241
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:35,483
What's to say? I just don't
know what he wants from me.

1242
01:26:37,777 --> 01:26:39,988
I don't want nothing from you.

1243
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:43,032
I don't want nothing from you.

1244
01:26:43,908 --> 01:26:47,787
This ain't no charity case.
Get out of my house.

1245
01:26:47,829 --> 01:26:49,831
It's not just your house.

1246
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:52,792
You're no friend no more.

1247
01:26:53,167 --> 01:26:56,296
- Get out of my house, I just says.
- Don't talk to him like that.

1248
01:26:56,337 --> 01:26:58,631
Both of you get out of my house!

1249
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:02,677
It's cold outside, Paulie.

1250
01:27:12,687 --> 01:27:14,814
I don't want you messing her

1251
01:27:14,856 --> 01:27:17,442
and I don't raise you
to go with this scum bum!

1252
01:27:17,483 --> 01:27:19,319
Yeah? Come on!
You wanna hit on me?

1253
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:23,197
Come on! I'll break both your arms
so they don't work for you.

1254
01:27:25,533 --> 01:27:26,659
Stop it!

1255
01:27:26,701 --> 01:27:29,996
I'm not good enough to meet with Gazzo?
That's what I think of Gazzo!

1256
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:34,667
Now you're a big shot fighter, you don't
even throw a crumb to your friend.

1257
01:27:34,709 --> 01:27:36,961
When I go and get your meat
every morning!

1258
01:27:37,003 --> 01:27:39,547
You forgot that? And then I
even give you my sister too!

1259
01:27:39,631 --> 01:27:42,258
- Only a pig would say that!
- I'm a pig?

1260
01:27:43,009 --> 01:27:45,011
A pig gets you the best?

1261
01:27:45,845 --> 01:27:49,015
You're such a loser!
I don't get married because of you!

1262
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:51,517
You can't live by yourself!

1263
01:27:51,935 --> 01:27:55,605
I put you two together,
and don't you forget it!

1264
01:27:55,688 --> 01:27:57,065
You owe me!

1265
01:27:59,567 --> 01:28:01,694
- You owe me!
- What do I owe you?

1266
01:28:01,778 --> 01:28:04,197
You're supposed to be good to me!

1267
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,825
What do I owe you, Paulie?

1268
01:28:07,867 --> 01:28:09,535
I treat you good!

1269
01:28:09,577 --> 01:28:12,997
I cook for you, I clean for you,
I pick up your dirty clothes!

1270
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:16,376
I take care of you, Paulie!
I don't owe you nothing!

1271
01:28:17,085 --> 01:28:19,545
And you made me
feel like a loser!

1272
01:28:20,713 --> 01:28:22,382
I'm not a loser!

1273
01:28:22,465 --> 01:28:24,300
- You're busted!
- What?

1274
01:28:24,384 --> 01:28:26,177
You're not a virgin!

1275
01:28:26,594 --> 01:28:28,888
You let a man take
down your pants!

1276
01:28:28,972 --> 01:28:30,431
She's busted!

1277
01:28:33,559 --> 01:28:35,603
I can't haul meat no more!

1278
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:07,844
You want a roommate?

1279
01:29:12,807 --> 01:29:14,142
Absolutely.

1280
01:29:16,019 --> 01:29:18,312
Okay, now
when you walk into the ring

1281
01:29:18,396 --> 01:29:21,149
with the number one
heavyweight of the world

1282
01:29:21,232 --> 01:29:22,900
you'll be ready, won't you?

1283
01:29:22,942 --> 01:29:26,404
Why? Because I waited for 50 years

1284
01:29:26,446 --> 01:29:28,114
to make you ready.

1285
01:29:28,197 --> 01:29:30,616
You'll be able to spit nails, kid!

1286
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:33,327
Like the guy says,
you're gonna eat lightning

1287
01:29:33,411 --> 01:29:35,288
and you're gonna crap thunder!

1288
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:38,124
You're gonna become
a very dangerous person.

1289
01:29:38,207 --> 01:29:39,500
Yo, Mickey.

1290
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:41,669
Hey, how are you? Oh, Rock.

1291
01:29:41,753 --> 01:29:44,839
I want you to meet our cut man here.
Al Salvani.

1292
01:29:44,922 --> 01:29:46,924
- Take a look at his eye.
- How you doing, Al?

1293
01:29:46,966 --> 01:29:49,427
- That's right.
- It ain't bad. Seen worse.

1294
01:29:49,469 --> 01:29:52,305
- You ain't so bad yourself.
- Cover up. Things will be okay.

1295
01:29:52,388 --> 01:29:53,598
You cover up.

1296
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:55,433
Go and take a shower.

1297
01:29:55,475 --> 01:29:57,935
Okay, Mick. I'll see you tomorrow.

1298
01:29:58,978 --> 01:30:02,065
You covered that Whitmore fight?

1299
01:30:02,148 --> 01:30:04,901
- That's why he won.
- Listen. We got a winner here.

1300
01:30:04,984 --> 01:30:09,030
We got a chance. He goes to the body
like nobody you've ever seen.

1301
01:30:09,113 --> 01:30:11,991
You just stand by. We're gonna win.

1302
01:30:18,956 --> 01:30:21,459
Hey, Rock. It's okay I talk to you?

1303
01:30:22,043 --> 01:30:24,796
Okay you talk to me? Sure.

1304
01:30:25,588 --> 01:30:28,466
I figured some angle
to make some money off your name.

1305
01:30:28,508 --> 01:30:31,177
My name? How's that?

1306
01:30:31,344 --> 01:30:34,013
Advertising.
I know about that stuff.

1307
01:30:35,807 --> 01:30:38,309
What do you know about advertising?

1308
01:30:41,604 --> 01:30:44,524
Hey, you can make money off my name,
make it, okay?

1309
01:30:44,607 --> 01:30:46,609
I'm gonna take a shower.

1310
01:30:47,568 --> 01:30:50,113
- Wanna help me off with these?
- Sure.

1311
01:32:25,458 --> 01:32:27,293
You're gonna kill him!

1312
01:35:18,172 --> 01:35:21,675
Rocky. What brings you here tonight?

1313
01:35:23,302 --> 01:35:25,221
Mr. Jergens, the poster's wrong.

1314
01:35:25,763 --> 01:35:27,431
What do you mean?

1315
01:35:27,598 --> 01:35:30,434
I'm wearing white pants
with a red stripe.

1316
01:35:34,271 --> 01:35:36,690
It doesn't really matter, does it?

1317
01:35:36,774 --> 01:35:39,610
I'm sure you're gonna give us
a great show.

1318
01:35:40,653 --> 01:35:42,696
Try to get some rest, kid.

1319
01:35:43,531 --> 01:35:44,907
Good night.

1320
01:37:16,248 --> 01:37:17,791
I can't do it.

1321
01:37:20,878 --> 01:37:21,962
What?

1322
01:37:23,088 --> 01:37:24,715
I can't beat him.

1323
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:27,551
Apollo?

1324
01:37:28,260 --> 01:37:29,428
Yeah.

1325
01:37:30,846 --> 01:37:33,766
I been out there, walking
around, thinking.

1326
01:37:35,684 --> 01:37:38,938
Who am I kidding?
I ain't even in the guy's league.

1327
01:37:44,318 --> 01:37:46,153
What are we gonna do?

1328
01:37:57,748 --> 01:37:59,166
I don't know.

1329
01:38:05,548 --> 01:38:07,299
You worked so hard.

1330
01:38:09,176 --> 01:38:12,388
Yeah, it don't matter,
'cause I was nobody before.

1331
01:38:14,723 --> 01:38:16,308
Don't say that.

1332
01:38:17,017 --> 01:38:19,311
Oh, come on, Adrian. It's true.

1333
01:38:19,395 --> 01:38:20,896
I was nobody.

1334
01:38:22,815 --> 01:38:25,484
But that don't matter
either, you know?

1335
01:38:26,527 --> 01:38:28,445
'Cause I was thinking,

1336
01:38:29,697 --> 01:38:32,616
it really don't matter
if I lose this fight.

1337
01:38:34,702 --> 01:38:38,289
It really don't matter
if this guy opens my head either.

1338
01:38:39,582 --> 01:38:42,376
'Cause all I wanna do
is go the distance.

1339
01:38:47,298 --> 01:38:50,175
Nobody's ever gone the distance
with Creed,

1340
01:38:51,010 --> 01:38:53,262
and if I can go that distance,

1341
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:57,683
and that bell rings,
and I'm still standing,

1342
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:06,317
I'm gonna know
for the first time in my life, see,

1343
01:39:08,193 --> 01:39:11,697
that I weren't just another bum
from the neighborhood.

1344
01:40:19,181 --> 01:40:20,974
Time, kid. Let's go.

1345
01:40:24,019 --> 01:40:25,938
I'll wait for you here.

1346
01:40:28,273 --> 01:40:31,068
How about I wait here
and you fight, huh?

1347
01:40:31,944 --> 01:40:35,030
You're looking very great today,
you know that?

1348
01:40:37,032 --> 01:40:40,119
I gotta go now,
but don't you leave town, huh?

1349
01:40:41,537 --> 01:40:43,914
Wish me luck. I'm gonna need it.

1350
01:40:44,665 --> 01:40:45,999
Good luck.

1351
01:40:46,792 --> 01:40:50,087
Adrian, you don't think
this robe is too baggy, huh?

1352
01:40:50,295 --> 01:40:51,630
Good luck.

1353
01:40:51,672 --> 01:40:53,340
Don't leave town.

1354
01:40:55,718 --> 01:40:59,346
<i>I'd like you to meet
my colleague, Stu Nahan.</i>

1355
01:40:59,430 --> 01:41:00,806
<i>Thank you, Bill Baldwin.</i>

1356

<i>The electricity is all over the
place tonight, as Rocky Balboa...</i>

1357
01:41:05,561 --> 01:41:07,396
What is that?

1358
01:41:07,479 --> 01:41:09,815
I trained you to be a fighter,
not a billboard.

1359
01:41:09,857 --> 01:41:12,484
- I'm doing it for a friend.
- What do you get out of it?

1360
01:41:12,568 --> 01:41:14,486
Paulie gets $3,000. I get the robe.

1361
01:41:14,528 --> 01:41:15,779
Shrewd.

1362
01:41:16,363 --> 01:41:19,032
<i>The story about tonight's fight,
their difference in style,</i>

1363
01:41:19,116 --> 01:41:21,368
<i>you can quote
a recent sports magazine which said,</i>

1364
01:41:21,452 --> 01:41:23,495
<i>it could be
"the caveman against the cavalier."</i>

1365
01:41:23,579 --> 01:41:25,497
<i>I notice a buzzing
in the background.</i>

1366
01:41:25,539 --> 01:41:28,167
<i>Could be the challenger is getting
ready to get into the ring.</i>

1367
01:41:28,208 --> 01:41:30,419
Rocky, look at my date.

1368
01:41:30,502 --> 01:41:32,504
- Cost me $200.
- $250.

1369
01:41:32,588 --> 01:41:34,256
I gotta go. I gotta work.

1370
01:41:34,339 --> 01:41:36,675
- How's the robe?
- A little baggy.

1371
01:41:36,717 --> 01:41:39,678
<i>A 50-to-1 underdog
living a Cinderella story,</i>

1372
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:43,474

imaginations all over the world.</i>

1373
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:49,772
We love you, Rocky!

1374
01:41:50,105 --> 01:41:52,941
- Good luck, champ.
- Thanks for showing up.

1375
01:41:53,442 --> 01:41:55,360
<i>And his record, 44 victories.</i>

1376
01:41:55,444 --> 01:41:58,030
<i>He's had 38 by knockout,
and he's lost 20 fights.</i>

1377
01:41:58,071 --> 01:42:00,491
<i>Which makes me wonder,
can he stand it?</i>

1378

<i>You know, the stamina and the skill
to last three rounds.</i>

1379
01:42:03,285 --> 01:42:05,245
<i>Because Las Vegas odds say no.</i>

1380
01:42:05,329 --> 01:42:08,165
<i>Rocky Balboa,
climbing into the ring now.</i>

1381
01:42:08,874 --> 01:42:10,375
<i>"The Italian Stallion."</i>

1382
01:42:10,459 --> 01:42:14,379
<i>Some meat sign on the back of his robe.
You seen what that was?</i>

1383
01:42:14,421 --> 01:42:16,465
<i>Shamrock Meat...</i>

1384
01:42:16,548 --> 01:42:19,718
<i>There's a lot of noise
coming from the background.</i>

1385
01:42:20,219 --> 01:42:22,888
<i>- They have spotlights.
- I see right back there.</i>

1386
01:42:22,930 --> 01:42:26,433
<i>Is that the world heavyweight
champion, Apollo Creed?</i>

1387
01:42:26,517 --> 01:42:30,562
<i>He's riding in a boat. Is he
supposed to be George Washington?</i>

1388
01:42:30,604 --> 01:42:33,899
<i>Obviously so.
He's got the hat on, the whole thing.</i>

1389
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,986
<i>The world champion, Apollo Creed</i>

1390
01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:40,906
<i>is doing an imitation
of George Washington.</i>

1391
01:42:41,865 --> 01:42:43,575
<i>He's throwing money.</i>

1392
01:42:43,617 --> 01:42:47,079
<i>Remember when we were growing up,
we were taught about George Washington</i>

1393
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:48,580
<i>throwing a dollar.</i>

1394
01:42:48,664 --> 01:42:51,416
<i>If you threw a dollar in those days,
it went a lot farther.</i>

1395
01:42:51,458 --> 01:42:54,211
<i>Now he's taking his...
Blonde wig came off.</i>

1396
01:42:54,253 --> 01:42:55,921
<i>The hat came off.</i>

1397
01:42:57,256 --> 01:42:58,674
I want you!

1398
01:42:59,925 --> 01:43:02,427
<i>The crowd is loving
every minute of it.</i>

1399
01:43:02,469 --> 01:43:05,556
<i>- Here is the world heavyweight champion.
- Apollo Creed.</i>

1400
01:43:05,597 --> 01:43:07,057
<i>For you around the world</i>

1401
01:43:07,099 --> 01:43:10,060
<i>he was dressed as George Washington,
the father of our country.</i>

1402
01:43:10,102 --> 01:43:11,520
I want you!

1403
01:43:14,273 --> 01:43:17,776
<i>I don't believe what I'm seeing.
Uncle Sam himself!</i>

1404
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:19,403
I want you!

1405
01:43:19,444 --> 01:43:22,322
I want all of you!

1406
01:43:22,906 --> 01:43:24,783
He looks like a big flag.

1407
01:43:24,825 --> 01:43:26,910
I want you!

1408
01:43:28,078 --> 01:43:30,372
- Is he talking to me?
- He's talking to you.

1409
01:43:30,455 --> 01:43:32,624
- Is he talking to me?
- Let him talk.

1410
01:43:32,708 --> 01:43:34,501
I want the Stallion!

1411
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:37,462
<i>He says, "I want the Stallion."</i>

1412
01:43:38,964 --> 01:43:41,967
<i>For you in foreign countries,
during World War I,</i>

1413
01:43:42,050 --> 01:43:44,970
<i>the picture of Uncle Sam
with his finger pointed like that</i>

1414
01:43:45,012 --> 01:43:47,472
<i>was a recruiting poster
for our fellows in the service,</i>

1415
01:43:47,514 --> 01:43:49,766
<i>the army and the navy.
"I want you."</i>

1416
01:43:49,808 --> 01:43:51,935
<i>That's what he's doing a take on.</i>

1417
01:43:51,977 --> 01:43:55,272
<i>He's yelling, "Creed in three."</i>

1418
01:43:55,314 --> 01:43:57,482
What do you think
that outfit cost?

1419
01:44:07,868 --> 01:44:10,037
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1420
01:44:10,746 --> 01:44:14,625
<i>Good evening.
A very Happy New Year.</i>

1421
01:44:14,666 --> 01:44:16,710
<i>Welcome to Philadelphia.</i>

1422
01:44:16,793 --> 01:44:19,546
<i>Everybody who's anybody
is here tonight.</i>

1423
01:44:21,757 --> 01:44:25,177
<i>Time does not
permit me to introduce</i>

1424
01:44:25,510 --> 01:44:28,680
<i>the many luminaries of politics,</i>

1425
01:44:28,722 --> 01:44:33,185
<i>show business and the sporting world
who are with us tonight</i>

1426
01:44:33,518 --> 01:44:35,687
<i>but I would like to present</i>

1427
01:44:35,729 --> 01:44:38,815
<i>one of the immortals of pugilism,</i>

1428
01:44:38,857 --> 01:44:42,527
<i>a champion in and out of the ring,</i>

1429
01:44:42,611 --> 01:44:45,364
<i>Philadelphia's own "Smoking Joe,"</i>

1430
01:44:45,447 --> 01:44:48,283
<i>the beloved Mr. Joe Frazier!</i>

1431
01:44:59,044 --> 01:45:00,337
How you doing?

1432
01:45:00,379 --> 01:45:01,838
Don't hurt him, okay?

1433
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:03,548
I'll try not to.

1434
01:45:03,590 --> 01:45:06,009
<i>What a credit he's been
in his career as a fighter</i>

1435
01:45:06,051 --> 01:45:08,220
<i>Now he's coming over
to talk to the champ.</i>

1436
01:45:08,261 --> 01:45:10,722
- Hey, Joe.
- You been ducking me a long time.

1437
01:45:10,806 --> 01:45:12,474
No, Joe. You're next.

1438
01:45:12,557 --> 01:45:14,768
- You're next.
- You understand?

1439
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:16,895
They must be friends.

1440
01:45:25,278 --> 01:45:27,114
Joe Frazier!

1441
01:45:27,197 --> 01:45:29,408
<i>- Fight fans, get settled down.
- Go home!</i>

1442
01:45:29,449 --> 01:45:32,619
<i>- Don't stay in the arena!
- It won't be long now.</i>

1443
01:45:34,079 --> 01:45:37,541
<i>Now for the main event.</i>

1444
01:45:41,253 --> 01:45:42,879
<i>On my left</i>

1445
01:45:42,921 --> 01:45:46,091
<i>the challenger, in white trunks,</i>

1446
01:45:46,133 --> 01:45:49,302
<i>weighing 190 pounds.</i>

1447
01:45:49,386 --> 01:45:51,888
<i>Philadelphia's favorite son,</i>

1448
01:45:51,930 --> 01:45:54,808
<i>The Italian Stallion,</i>

1449
01:45:54,891 --> 01:45:56,977
<i>Rocky Balboa.</i>

1450
01:46:03,942 --> 01:46:06,278
<i>And on my right</i>

1451
01:46:06,319 --> 01:46:08,780
<i>wearing red, white and blue,</i>

1452
01:46:08,864 --> 01:46:11,992
<i>weighing 210 pounds,</i>

1453
01:46:12,075 --> 01:46:15,495
<i>undefeated in 46 fights,</i>

1454
01:46:15,787 --> 01:46:18,290
<i>The Master of Disaster,</i>

1455
01:46:18,790 --> 01:46:22,502
<i>the undisputed heavyweight champion
of the world,</i>

1456
01:46:22,586 --> 01:46:24,379
<i>Apollo Creed!</i>

1457
01:46:26,173 --> 01:46:28,717
I want you! You!

1458
01:46:31,428 --> 01:46:34,264
You, chump. I want you!

1459
01:46:34,306 --> 01:46:37,309
You've both fought in
Philadelphia before. You know the rules.

1460
01:46:37,392 --> 01:46:40,562
No low blows,
watch your heads, no butting.

1461
01:46:40,645 --> 01:46:42,397
Shake hands and come out fighting.

1462
01:46:42,481 --> 01:46:44,149
Put your hands up there, chump.

1463
01:46:44,191 --> 01:46:46,318
- Come out fighting.
- Come on!

1464
01:46:48,361 --> 01:46:53,241
<i>Rocky's just going over and
being calm, it looks like from here.</i>

1465
01:46:54,367 --> 01:46:56,286
<i>There goes the big hat.</i>

1466
01:46:59,748 --> 01:47:03,335
<i>I've never seen a fighter
that concerned about his hair.</i>

1467
01:47:11,384 --> 01:47:13,678
<i>There's the bell for round one.</i>

1468
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:19,309
<i>The fighters come in the center of
the ring, looking at each other.</i>

1469
01:47:19,351 --> 01:47:22,854
<i>Creed, the champion,
zipping in those left-handed jabs.</i>

1470
01:47:22,896 --> 01:47:24,856
<i>Right there. Bang.</i>

1471
01:47:26,483 --> 01:47:29,694
<i>The champ stinging the slower
challenger with jabs at will.</i>

1472
01:47:29,736 --> 01:47:33,740
<i>In fact, it looks like Rocky
is blocking the blows with his face.</i>

1473
01:47:33,824 --> 01:47:38,203
<i>The champion doesn't look the best
he's ever been, but he's moving now.</i>

1474
01:47:38,286 --> 01:47:42,249
<i>The champion's smiling now.
He's toying with him.</i>

1475
01:47:43,041 --> 01:47:46,002
<i>Trying to give the fans
their money's worth.</i>

1476
01:47:47,671 --> 01:47:51,133
<i>He's very clearly outclassed
the challenger right now.</i>

1477
01:47:53,301 --> 01:47:57,222
<i>He's trying to make his
man miss like that.</i>

1478
01:47:58,723 --> 01:48:01,393
<i>The champ is just taunting him.</i>

1479
01:48:04,271 --> 01:48:06,064
<i>Creed dancing around.</i>

1480
01:48:07,524 --> 01:48:09,359
<i>I don't believe this!</i>

1481
01:48:09,401 --> 01:48:11,820
<i>The champ is down!</i>

1482
01:48:17,951 --> 01:48:19,161
<i>Creed is down!</i>

1483
01:48:19,244 --> 01:48:21,204
<i>What a surprise this is!</i>

1484
01:48:22,372 --> 01:48:25,709
<i>This is the first time the champion
has ever been knocked down.</i>

1485
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:27,961
<i>The referee is giving
him the count.</i>

1486
01:48:28,044 --> 01:48:30,922
Six, seven, eight.

1487
01:48:31,164 --> 01:48:34,250
<i>He appears to be all right.
Glassy-eyed but okay.</i>

1488
01:48:34,259 --> 01:48:37,429
Go to the ribs!
Go to work, Rock!

1489
01:48:37,512 --> 01:48:39,055
Come on!

1490
01:48:40,307 --> 01:48:43,560
<i>Rocky coming back out, and he's
like a bull in a china closet.</i>

1491
01:48:43,602 --> 01:48:46,563
<i>He really wants it.
Apollo, left to the head.</i>

1492
01:48:46,646 --> 01:48:50,358
<i>The champion's coming off the floor</i>

1493
01:48:50,442 --> 01:48:52,527
<i>and he's trying to put him away.</i>

1494
01:48:52,611 --> 01:48:54,112
<i>A left, a right.</i>

1495
01:48:54,196 --> 01:48:57,657
<i>Combinations into the face!
That's the Apollo we know.</i>

1496
01:49:01,786 --> 01:49:05,123
<i>Now the champ is taunting Rocky
to come and get some more.</i>

1497
01:49:05,207 --> 01:49:06,833
<i>A left. Another.</i>

1498
01:49:07,375 --> 01:49:08,877
<i>Another left.</i>

1499
01:49:10,295 --> 01:49:12,130
<i>Rocky's coming back!</i>

1500
01:49:13,590 --> 01:49:16,468
<i>Rocky's got him on the ropes!</i>

1501
01:49:17,302 --> 01:49:18,803
Let's break it.

1502
01:49:20,305 --> 01:49:21,806
You're holding.

1503
01:49:21,890 --> 01:49:23,683
You're posing as a boxer.

1504
01:49:23,767 --> 01:49:26,853
<i>There's no way we expected
this kind of hitting.</i>

1505
01:49:34,444 --> 01:49:38,156
<i>Apollo unloading a left.
He's got him up against the ropes.</i>

1506
01:49:45,914 --> 01:49:50,001
<i>They're leading him to his corner.
Rocky can't find his way.</i>

1507
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:52,128
I called it!

1508
01:49:52,170 --> 01:49:54,714
- Your nose is broke.
- How's it look?

1509
01:49:54,798 --> 01:49:56,341
It's an improvement.

1510
01:49:56,383 --> 01:49:59,678
Quit shucking and jiving!
Stick and move!

1511
01:49:59,719 --> 01:50:03,223
Go for the ribs.
Don't let that bastard breathe.

1512
01:50:03,306 --> 01:50:04,724
The guy's quick.

1513
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:08,645
He doesn't know it's a damn show.
He thinks it's a damn fight.

1514
01:50:08,687 --> 01:50:11,398
Finish this bum, and let's go home.

1515
01:50:12,399 --> 01:50:14,818
Stay to the body.
You're doing great!

1516
01:50:14,859 --> 01:50:18,113
<i>Round two. Creed predicted
he'd win it in three.</i>

1517
01:50:18,196 --> 01:50:21,741
<i>Creed got knocked down in the first.
He came back strong.</i>

1518
01:50:22,117 --> 01:50:23,785
<i>He's working hard.</i>

1519
01:50:24,202 --> 01:50:26,955
<i>A sharp left.
Again, a hard right.</i>

1520
01:50:27,038 --> 01:50:29,541
<i>Now coming in.
He's knocked him into the corner again.</i>

1521
01:50:29,582 --> 01:50:32,127
<i>The champion's got him
backed into the corner.</i>

1522
01:50:32,210 --> 01:50:36,131
<i>Pummeling him left and right,
his head bouncing against the ropes.</i>

1523
01:50:37,007 --> 01:50:40,051
<i>Balboa's taking
a tremendous beating here.</i>

1524
01:50:40,135 --> 01:50:43,722
<i>Battering him like a punching bag.
What's keeping him up?</i>

1525
01:50:46,057 --> 01:50:47,559
Can't you fight?

1526
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:50,895
Stop clowning around
and give the people something!

1527
01:50:51,563 --> 01:50:53,898

of there, but he can't do it.</i>

1532

<i>He can't even get his gloves up
to protect himself.</i>

1543

Down! Stay down!

1544
01:52:56,604 --> 01:52:58,940
<i>Apollo has his arms in the air!</i>

<i>This has been a tremendous...</i>

1554

Okay, champ?

1555
01:53:59,042 --> 01:54:00,376
Yeah, I'm okay.

1556
01:54:00,418 --> 01:54:03,087
I may have broke my ribs.

1557
01:54:03,129 --> 01:54:05,590
I can't see nothing.
Gotta open my eye.

1558
01:54:05,673 --> 01:54:07,592
- Cut me.
- Don't wanna do it.

1559
01:54:07,675 --> 01:54:10,220
- Go ahead. Cut me.
- Okay.

1560
01:54:10,261 --> 01:54:11,804
Try it. Cut it.

1561
01:54:12,263 --> 01:54:14,140
Creed! Creed!

1562

Oh, God.

1563
01:54:17,435 --> 01:54:20,230
You're bleeding inside.
I'm gonna stop the fight.

1564
01:54:20,271 --> 01:54:23,608
You ain't stopping
nothing, man.

1565
01:54:23,775 --> 01:54:26,277
You stop this fight,
I'll kill you!

1566
01:54:27,612 --> 01:54:29,781
- I'm going.
- If you wanna go.

1567
01:54:31,032 --> 01:54:33,368
You gotta give it all!

1568
01:54:33,451 --> 01:54:35,411
You gotta get him!

<i>The 15th and final round.</i>

1570

Ain't gonna be no rematch.

01:55:45,607 --> 01:55:47,150
Don't want one.

1585
01:55:57,660 --> 01:56:00,622
Rocky, you went the distance,
15 rounds. How do you feel?
