1
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:58,579
Born of cold and Winter air And mountain rain combining,

2
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:03,369
This icy force both foul and fair.

3
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:06,879
Has a frozen heart worth mining.

4
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:10,879
Cut through the heart, Cold and Clear.

5
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,169
Strike for love And Strike for fear.

6
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:17,049
See the beauty Sharp and Sheer.

7
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:19,969
Split the ice apart.

8
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:23,349
And break the frozen heart.

9
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:26,679
Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

10
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:30,809
Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

11
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:33,189
Beautiful! Powerful!

12
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:34,399
Dangerous! Cold!

13
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:36,769
Ice has a magic Can't be controlled.

14
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:39,029
Stronger than one, Stronger than ten.

15
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:41,279
Stronger than a hundred men!

16
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:49,659
Born of cold and winter air And mountain rain combining.

17
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:51,829
This icy force both Foul and Fair.

18
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,999
Has a frozen heart worth mining.

19
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:56,919
Cut through the heart, Cold and Clear.

20
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:59,459
Strike for love and strike for fear.

21
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,789
There's beauty and there's Danger here.

22
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:04,129
Split the ice apart!

23
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:09,549
Beware the frozen heart.

24
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:15,719
Come on, Sven!

25
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:43,199
Elsa. Psst

26
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:46,329
Elsa!

27
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,789
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

28
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,829
Anna, go back to sleep.

29
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:57,249
I just can't. The sky's awake, so I'm awake,

30
00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:59,759
so we have to play.

31
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,259
...Go play by yourself.

32
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:10,639
Do you want to build a snowman?

33
00:04:11,929 --> 00:04:14,139
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

34
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:20,939
Do the magic! Do the magic!

35
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:26,939
Ready? Uhhm...

36
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,659
This is amazing!

37
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,739
Watch this!

38
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:48,749
Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

39
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:51,089
I love you, Olaf.

40
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:05,349
Al'right. Catch me! - Gotcha!

41
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:08,939
Again! Wait!

42
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,019
Slow down!

43
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,149
Anna!

44
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,109
Anna?

45
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:26,489
Mama! Papa!

46
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:37,329
You Ok, Anna. I Got you.

47
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:42,169
Elsa, what have you done?
This is getting out of hand!

48
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:45,549
It was an accident. I'm sorry, Anna.

49
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:49,679
- She's ice cold.
- I know where we have to go.

50
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,979
Ice?

51
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,029
Faster, Sven!

52
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:16,609
Sven!

53
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,619
Please... Help!

54
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:23,909
My daughter!

55
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:36,549
He is the King!

56
00:06:38,549 --> 00:06:40,379
Trolls...?

57
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,839
Shush. I'm trying to listen.

58
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,509
Cuties. I'm gonna keep you.

59
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:48,719
Your Majesty!

60
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:51,179
Born with the powers or cursed?

61
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:53,639
Born. And they're getting stronger.

62
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:59,399
You are lucky it wasn't her heart.

63
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,189
The heart is not so easily changed,

64
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,859
But the head can be persuaded.

65
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:06,649
Do what you must.

66
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:09,489
I recommend we remove all magic,

67
00:07:09,489 --> 00:07:13,119
even memories of magic to be safe...

68
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:18,159
But don't worry, I'll leave the fun.

69
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:24,829
She will be okay.

70
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:27,789
But she won't remember I have powers?

71
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:30,709
- It's for the best.
- Listen to me, Elsa,

72
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:33,969
your power will only grow.

73
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:37,299
There is beauty in it...

74
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:41,089
But also great danger.

75
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:43,889
You must learn to control it.

76
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:47,139
Fear will be your enemy.

77
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:53,269
No. We'll protect her. She can learn to control it. I'm sure.

78
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,269
Until then,

79
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:58,609
we'll lock the gates. We'll reduce the staff.

80
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:01,989
We will limit her contact with people

81
00:08:02,109 --> 00:08:05,029
and keep her powers hidden from everyone...

82
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:10,039
including Anna.

83
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,999
Elsa?

84
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:27,219
Do you want to build a snowman?

85
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,379
Come on let's go and play.

86
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:34,179
I never see you anymore. Come out the door.

87
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,219
It's like you've gone away.

88
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:39,519
We used to be best buddies.

89
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:44,809
And now we're not. I wish you would tell me why.

90
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:48,399
Do you want to build a snowman?

91
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,399
It doesn't have to be a snowman.

92
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:52,439
Go away, Anna.

93
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:55,489
...Okay bye.

94
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:04,449
The gloves will help. See...

95
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:07,199
- Conceal it.
- Don't feel it.

96
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:09,249
Don't let it show.

97
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:14,709
Do you want to build a snowman?

98
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:17,509
Or ride our bike around the hall?

99
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:20,169
I think some company is overdue...

100
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:23,259
I've started talking to the pictures on the walls.

101
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:24,379
Hang in there, Joan.

102
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:28,009
It gets a little lonely all these empty rooms.

103
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:31,679
Just watching the hours tick by.

104
00:09:36,849 --> 00:09:39,559
I'm scared. It's getting stronger.

105
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,819
Getting upset only makes it worse.

106
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:42,149
Calm down.

107
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:46,319
No. Don't touch me. Please. I don't want to hurt you.

108
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:55,909
See you in two weeks.

109
00:09:57,869 --> 00:10:01,579
- Do you have to go?
- You'll be fine, Elsa.

110
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:42,359
Elsa?

111
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:45,569
Please, I know you're in there.

112
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,989
People are asking where you've been,

113
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,579
They say have courage and I'm trying to...

114
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:58,129
I'm right out here for you. Just let me in.

115
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:01,209
We only have each other.

116
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:03,419
It's just you and me.

117
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:06,879
What are we gonna do?

118
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,469
Do you want to build a snowman?

119
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:42,949
Three Years Later.

120
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:53,169
Welcome to Arendelle! Thank you, Sir!

121
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:55,919
Watch your Steps please. The Gates Will opening Soon.

122
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:57,879
Why do I have to wear this?

123
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,879
Because the Queen has come of age.

124
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,879
It's Coronation Day!

125
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:04,179
That's not my fault.

126
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:13,849
- What do you want, Sven?
- Give me a snack!

127
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:16,979
What's the magic word? Please!

128
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:19,149
A..a... a... a! Share!

129
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,569
I can't believe they're finally opening up the gates!

130
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:24,729
And for a whole day!

131
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:26,529
Faster, Persi!

132
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:31,529
Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious trade partner.

133
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:34,489
Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets

134
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:36,409
and exploit your riches.

135
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,199
...Did I just say that out loud?

136
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:39,829
Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to.

137
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:41,499
See the Queen and the Princess.

138
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:43,709
I bet they're absolutely lovely.

139
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:46,379
I bet they are beautiful.

140
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:52,089
Princess Anna...?

141
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:54,839
...Huh? Yeah?

142
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:57,889
- Sorry to wake you, ma'am but...
- No, no, no. You didn't.

143
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:00,469
I've been up for hours.

144
00:13:04,849 --> 00:13:06,139
Who is it?

145
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:09,349
It's still me, ma'am. The gates will open soon.

146
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:12,019
Time to get ready. Of course!

147
00:13:12,849 --> 00:13:14,229
Ready for what?

148
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:16,649
Your sister's coronation, ma'am.

149
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:19,649
My sister's cor-neration...

150
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,449
It's coronation day!

151
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:28,039
It's coronation day!

152
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:31,659
The window is open! So's that door!

153
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:34,249
I didn't know they did that anymore.

154
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:38,289
Who knew we owned 8000 salad plates...?

155
00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:41,289
For years I have roamed these empty halls.

156
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:43,509
Why have a ballroom with no balls?

157
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:47,679
Finally, they're opening up the gates!

158
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:50,799
There'll be real, actual people

159
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,099
It'll be totally strange.

160
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:57,099
But wow am I so ready for this change!

161
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:01,809
For the first time in forever,

162
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:06,229
There'll be music, there'll be light.

163
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:10,899
For the first time in forever,

164
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:15,699
I'll be dancing through the night.

165
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:17,989
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy,

166
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:21,079
But I'm somewhere in that zone.

167
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:26,459
'Cause for the first time in forever,

168
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:32,209
I won't be alone. I can't wait to meet everyone...

169
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,959
What if I meet "the one"?

170
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,299
Tonight, imagine me gown and all.

171
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:40,589
Fetchingly draped against the wall.

172
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:44,839
The picture of sophisticated Grace.

173
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:47,639
I suddenly see him standing there,

174
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,179
a beautiful stranger tall and fair.

175
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:54,479
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face!

176
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,149
But then we laugh and talk all evening,

177
00:14:57,149 --> 00:14:59,729
Which is totally bizarre.

178
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:03,609
Nothing like the life I've led so far.

179
00:15:03,979 --> 00:15:07,899
For the first time in forever,

180
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,819
There'll be magic, There'll be fun.

181
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:17,159
For the first time in forever,

182
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:22,119
I could be noticed by someone.

183
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:24,789
And I know it is totally crazy.

184
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,879
To dream I'd find romance.

185
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:33,049
But for the first time in forever,

186
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:36,879
At least I've got a chance!

187
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:47,099
Don't let them in. Don't let them see.

188
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:51,309
Be the good girl You always have to be.

189
00:15:52,729 --> 00:15:56,189
Conceal. Don't feel.

190
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:58,819
Put on a show.

191
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:02,859
Make one wrong move and everyone will know.

192
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:05,659
But it's only for today.

193
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:08,079
It's only for today! It's agony to wait.

194
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,869
It's agony to wait.

195
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:13,249
Tell the guards to open up the...

196
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:15,959
The gate!

197
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:19,919
For the first time in forever.

198
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,089
Don't let them in don't let them see

199
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:25,509
I'm getting what I'm dreaming of.

200
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:27,629
Be the good girl you always have to be.

201
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:31,219
A chance to change my Only world.

202
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:33,059
Conceal. Conceal. Don't feel.

203
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:37,849
- A chance to find true love
- Don't See, Don't Feel, Don't Let them know.

204
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:41,019
I know it all ends tomorrow,

205
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:43,939
So it has to be today!

206
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:49,189
'Cause for the first time in forever...

207
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:54,909
For the first time in forever!

208
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:01,069
Nothing's in my way!

209
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:08,709
Hey! I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

210
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:10,079
Hey!

211
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:14,129
I-ya, no. No. I'm okay. Are you sure?

212
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,009
Yeah, I just wasn't looking where I was going.

213
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:21,259
- But I'm great, actually.
- Oh, thank goodness.

214
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:26,389
Oh... Umm...

215
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:28,599
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

216
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:31,769
Princess Anna of Arendelle. Princess...?

217
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:33,559
My Lady.

218
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:38,769
Hi... again.

219
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:40,769
Oh boy.

220
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,779
Ha. This is awkward. Not you're awkward,

221
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:44,859
but just because we're...I'm awkward.

222
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:46,319
You're gorgeous. Wait, what?

223
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,609
I'd like to formally apologize for

224
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,199
hitting the Princess of Arendelle with my horse...

225
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,409
And for every moment after.

226
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:55,279
No. No-no. It's fine. I'm not THAT Princess.

227
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,119
I mean, if you'd hit my sister Elsa, that would be...

228
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,619
'Cuz, you know...

229
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:01,659
Hello.

230
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:05,379
But, lucky you, it's-it's just me.

231
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:07,499
Just you?

232
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,339
...The bells. The coronation.

233
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:17,639
I... I...

234
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,139
I better go. I have to...I better go.

235
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,059
Bye!

236
00:19:08,469 --> 00:19:11,429
Your Majesty, The gloves.

237
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:33,949
(formal, in Old Norse) Sehm hon hell drr in-um hell-gum Ayg-num Ok

238
00:19:33,949 --> 00:19:41,409
krund ee thes-um hellgah Stahth, ehk teh frahm fur-ear Uthear...

239
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:44,789
...Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

240
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:47,999
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

241
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:07,639
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

242
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:12,889
Princess Anna of Arendelle!

243
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:21,189
Here? Are you sure? I do not think I suppose to...Okay.

244
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:31,619
Hi.

245
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:34,989
Hi me...? Oh. Um. Hi.

246
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,459
You look beautiful...Thank you.

247
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,669
You look beautifuller. I mean, not Fuller.

248
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:43,669
You don't look Fuller, but more beautiful.

249
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:45,669
Thank you.

250
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:49,459
So, this is what a party looks like?

251
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:52,009
It's warmer than I thought.

252
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:55,719
And what is that amazing smell?

253
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,469
... Chocolate.

254
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,979
Your Majesty. The Duke of Weaseltown.

255
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:07,599
Weselton. The Duke of Weselton..

256
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,229
Your Majesty,

257
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:11,899
As your closest partner in trade,

258
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:13,149
It seems only fitting that I offer you.

259
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:15,609
Your first dance as Queen.

260
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,329
Thank you... Only I don't dance.

261
00:21:25,329 --> 00:21:27,659
But my sister does.

262
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,699
Lucky you...Oh, I don't think...

263
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:33,459
If you swoon, let me know, I'll catch you.

264
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,959
Sorry.

265
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:37,629
Like an agile peacock...

266
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:41,539
Speaking of, so great to have the gates open.

267
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:44,089
Why did they shut them in the first place?

268
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:46,049
Do you know the reason? Hmm?

269
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:48,509
No. No...

270
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:50,139
Oh, all right. Hang on.

271
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:52,599
They don't call me "the little dipper" for nothing.

272
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:57,979
Like a chicken...with the face of a monkey... I fly.

273
00:21:59,349 --> 00:22:01,729
Let me know when you're ready for another round, M'Lady.

274
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:05,109
Well, he was sprightly.

275
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:07,319
Especially for a man in heels.

276
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:11,569
Are you okay? I've never been better.

277
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:13,739
This is so nice.

278
00:22:13,739 --> 00:22:16,319
I wish it could be like this all the time.

279
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:18,329
Me too...

280
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:22,659
But it can't.

281
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:25,579
Why not? If...It just can't.

282
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:31,629
Excuse me for a minute.

283
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:42,889
Glad I caught you. Hans!

284
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:58,729
I often had the whole parlor to myself to slide...Oops. Sorry.

285
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:01,359
... Your physique helps I'm sure too.

286
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:08,989
What's this? I was born with it,

287
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:11,409
Although I dreamt I was kissed by a troll.

288
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:12,869
I like it.

289
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:15,489
Yeah, The whole thing! You got it.

290
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,869
Okay wait, wait. So you have how many brothers?

291
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:21,039
Twelve older brothers.

292
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,539
Three of them pretended I was invisible...

293
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:25,879
literally... for two years.

294
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:28,669
- That's horrible.
- It's what brothers do.

295
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:30,379
... And sisters.

296
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:32,339
Elsa and I were really close when we were little.

297
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:36,929
But then, one day she just shut me out, and...

298
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:38,929
And I never knew why.

299
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:41,429
I would never shut you out.

300
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,559
Okay, can I just say something crazy?

301
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,059
I love crazy.

302
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:52,519
All my life has been a series of doors in my face.

303
00:23:52,689 --> 00:23:55,859
And then suddenly I bump into you.

304
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:58,029
I was thinking the same thing, because like...

305
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:02,159
I've been searching my whole life to find my own place.

306
00:24:02,489 --> 00:24:04,619
And maybe it's the party talking,

307
00:24:04,619 --> 00:24:06,779
Or the chocolate fondue.

308
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,909
But with you...

309
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:10,539
I found my place.

310
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:11,869
I see your face.

311
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:15,959
And it's nothing like I've ever known before.

312
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,999
Love is an open... door!

313
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:25,379
Love is an open... door...Door...

314
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,469
Love is an open... door...

315
00:24:27,469 --> 00:24:30,429
With you! With you!

316
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:34,179
Love is an open door.

317
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:42,439
I mean it's crazy. What?

318
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,559
We finish each other's...Sandwiches!

319
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,939
That's what I was gonna say!

320
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:48,979
I've never met someone...Who thinks so much like me.

321
00:24:48,979 --> 00:24:50,609
Jinx... jinx again.

322
00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:55,449
Our Mental Synchronization Can have but one explanation,

323
00:24:55,609 --> 00:24:59,579
You and I were just meant to be.

324
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:02,199
Say goodbye.

325
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:05,209
To the pain of the past.

326
00:25:05,209 --> 00:25:08,829
We don't have to feel it anymore!

327
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:11,879
Love is an open... door!

328
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:18,129
Love is an open door!

329
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:23,339
Life can be so much more...with you! With you!

330
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:27,139
Love is an open... door.

331
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,559
Can I say something crazy...?

332
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:32,889
Will you marry me?

333
00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:35,059
Can I just say something even crazier?

334
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:36,559
Yes.

335
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:45,359
Oops! Pardon. Sorry. Can we just get around you there?

336
00:25:45,649 --> 00:25:47,659
Thank you. Oh, there she is.

337
00:25:47,699 --> 00:25:50,279
Elsa! I mean... Queen...

338
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:53,079
Me again. May I present,

339
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:55,579
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

340
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:57,409
Your Majesty.

341
00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:00,039
We would like...your blessing...

342
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,999
of... our marriage!

343
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:05,669
Marriage...? Yes!

344
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:07,089
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

345
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:09,259
Well, We haven't worked out all the details ourselves.

346
00:26:09,259 --> 00:26:11,089
We'll need a few days to plan the ceremony.

347
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:12,169
Of course we'll have soup,

348
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:13,259
roast, and ice cream and then...

349
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:14,969
Wait. Would we live here?

350
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:16,679
Here? Absolutely!

351
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:17,349
Anna...

352
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:19,639
Oh, we can invite all twelve of your brothers to stay with us...

353
00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:20,969
What? No, no, no, no, no.

354
00:26:20,969 --> 00:26:22,219
Of course we have the room. I don't know. Some of them must...

355
00:26:22,219 --> 00:26:23,479
Wait. Slow down.

356
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:25,269
No one's brothers are staying here.

357
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:26,939
No one is getting married.

358
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:28,559
Wait, what?

359
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,649
May I talk to you, please. Alone.

360
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:33,899
No. Whatever you have to say, you...

361
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:35,689
you can say to both of us.

362
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:39,449
Fine. You can't marry a man you just met.

363
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:41,359
You Can if it's true love.

364
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,279
Anna, what do you know about true love?

365
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,869
More than you. All you know is how to shut people out.

366
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:51,159
You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no.

367
00:26:51,499 --> 00:26:53,709
Now, Excuse me.

368
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:55,459
Your Majesty, if I may ease your...

369
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:57,799
No, you may not. And I-I think you should go.

370
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:00,049
The party is over. Close the gates.

371
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:01,169
Yes, Your Majesty.

372
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:02,629
What? Elsa, no. No, wait!

373
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:04,049
Give me my glove!

374
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:07,679
Elsa, please. Please. I can't live like this anymore.

375
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:10,799
... Then leave.

376
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:17,679
... What did I ever do to you?!

377
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,439
Enough, Anna.

378
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:21,189
No. Why? Why do you shut me out?!

379
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:23,019
Why do you shut the world out?!

380
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:24,859
What are you so afraid of?!

381
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:27,109
I said, enough!

382
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:36,989
Sorcery. I knew there was

383
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,279
something dubious going on here.

384
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,949
Elsa...?

385
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,039
There she is.

386
00:27:53,249 --> 00:27:55,259
Your Majesty! Long live the Queen! Queen Elsa...

387
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:57,219
Come drink with us.

388
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,219
Queen Elsa.

389
00:28:01,589 --> 00:28:04,599
Your Majesty? Are you all right?

390
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,229
There she is! Stop her!

391
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:18,729
Please, just stay away from me.

392
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:20,229
Stay away!

393
00:28:22,739 --> 00:28:25,279
Monster... Monster!

394
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:34,789
Elsa!

395
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:41,709
Elsa...

396
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:49,049
Wait, Please!

397
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:02,929
Elsa, Stop!

398
00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:04,769
Anna! No.

399
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:13,019
The Fjord.

400
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,039
Snow?

401
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:34,209
Yes, snow!

402
00:29:34,209 --> 00:29:36,209
Are you all right? No.

403
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:39,419
Did you know? No.

404
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:41,719
Look! It's snowing! It's snowing!

405
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:43,419
The Queen has cursed this land!

406
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:45,129
She must be stopped!

407
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:47,089
You have to go after her...Wait, no!

408
00:29:47,339 --> 00:29:49,349
You! Is there sorcery in you, too?

409
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:51,389
Are you a monster, too?

410
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:54,429
No. No. I'm completely ordinary.

411
00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:56,429
That's right she is.

412
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:58,439
... In the best way.

413
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:00,189
And my sister's not a monster.

414
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:01,859
She nearly killed me.

415
00:30:01,939 --> 00:30:03,399
You slipped on ice...Her ice!

416
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:06,069
It was an accident. She was scared.

417
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:09,149
She didn't mean it. She didn't mean any of this...

418
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:11,399
Tonight was my fault. I pushed her.

419
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:14,119
So I'm the one that needs to go after her.

420
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:16,029
What? Yeah. Bring me my horse, please.

421
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:18,239
Anna, no. It's too dangerous.

422
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:20,239
Elsa's not dangerous.

423
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:22,329
I'll bring her back, And I'll make this right.

424
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:24,079
I'm coming with you...No.

425
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,869
I need you here to take care of Arendelle.

426
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:28,879
On my honor.

427
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:33,459
I leave Prince Hans in charge!

428
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:36,339
Are you sure you can trust her?

429
00:30:36,629 --> 00:30:38,379
I don't want you getting hurt.

430
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:40,219
She's my sister,

431
00:30:40,219 --> 00:30:42,219
She would never hurt me.

432
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:25,799
The Snow glows white on the mountain tonight,

433
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,379
Not a footprint to be seen.

434
00:31:29,629 --> 00:31:32,719
A kingdom of isolation.

435
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:36,179
And it looks like I'm the Queen.

436
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:43,269
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside.

437
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:49,269
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I tried...

438
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:54,739
Don't let them in, Don't let them see,

439
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:58,239
Be the good girl you always have to be.

440
00:31:58,239 --> 00:32:02,909
Conceal, Don't feel, Don't let them know.

441
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:07,449
Well, Now they know.

442
00:32:07,749 --> 00:32:11,419
Let it go. Let it go.

443
00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:14,919
Can't hold it back anymore.

444
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:18,289
Let it go. Let it go.

445
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:22,009
Turn away and Slam the door.

446
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:28,049
I don't care what they're going to say.

447
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:32,639
Let the storm rage on.

448
00:32:32,969 --> 00:32:36,429
The cold never bothered me anyway.

449
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:46,029
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small.

450
00:32:46,569 --> 00:32:50,029
And the fears that once controlled me.

451
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:54,409
Can't get to me at all.

452
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:57,949
It's time to see what I can do,

453
00:32:57,949 --> 00:33:01,499
To test the limits and Break through.

454
00:33:01,499 --> 00:33:05,709
No right, No wrong, No rules for me...

455
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:08,079
I'm free!

456
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:12,709
Let it go! Let it go!

457
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:16,259
I am one with the wind and sky.

458
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:19,839
Let it go! Let it go!

459
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,349
You'll never see me cry.

460
00:33:23,849 --> 00:33:27,219
Here I Stand And...

461
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:30,519
Here I'll stay.

462
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:34,269
Let the storm rage on...

463
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:48,119
My power flurries through the air into the ground.

464
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:55,199
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around.

465
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:02,129
And one thought crystallizes like An icy blast...

466
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:05,669
I'm never going back,

467
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:10,379
The Past is in the Past!

468
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:14,049
Let it go! Let it go!

469
00:34:14,049 --> 00:34:17,639
And I'll rise like the break of Dawn.

470
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:21,139
Let it go! Let it go!

471
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:24,939
That perfect girl is gone.

472
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:31,019
Here I stand in the light of day.

473
00:34:33,569 --> 00:34:38,569
Let the storm rage on!

474
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:42,739
The cold never bothered me anyway.

475
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:52,039
Elsa! Elsa!

476
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:56,629
Elsa, It's me, Anna...

477
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:59,709
Your sister who didn't mean to make you freeze the summer.

478
00:35:00,169 --> 00:35:03,469
I'm sorry. It's all my f-f-fault.

479
00:35:05,429 --> 00:35:07,429
Of course, none of this would have happened

480
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:09,389
if she'd just told me her secret... ha...

481
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,929
She's a stinker.

482
00:35:16,729 --> 00:35:19,189
Oh no. No. No. No. Come back. No.

483
00:35:20,229 --> 00:35:22,559
Oooo-Kay.

484
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,649
Snow, it had to be snow,

485
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:33,659
She couldn't have had tr-tr-tropical magic

486
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:37,529
that covered the f-f-fjords in white sand and warm...

487
00:35:38,529 --> 00:35:40,199
Fire! Whoa!

488
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:07,639
Wandering Oaken's Trading Post.

489
00:36:07,889 --> 00:36:09,639
Ooh! And Sauna...

490
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:19,319
Big summer blow out.

491
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:21,609
Half off swimming suits, clogs,

492
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:24,449
And a sun balm of my own invention, yah?

493
00:36:25,279 --> 00:36:26,869
Oh, great.

494
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:29,319
For now, how about boots,

495
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:31,739
Winter boots... and dresses?

496
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:34,199
That would be in our winter department.

497
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:42,709
Oh. Um, I was just wondering; Has another young woman,

498
00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:46,049
The Queen perhaps, I don't know, passed through here?

499
00:36:46,049 --> 00:36:49,299
Only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you, dear.

500
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:57,809
You and this fellow... Hoo hoo.

501
00:36:57,809 --> 00:36:59,559
Big summer blow out.

502
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:06,269
Carrots. Hah?

503
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,559
Behind you.

504
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:12,189
Oh, right. Excuse me.

505
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:15,399
A real howler in July, Yes?

506
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,239
Where ever could it be coming from?

507
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:19,779
The North Mountain.

508
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:21,409
North Mountain.

509
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,329
That'll be forty.

510
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:24,869
Forty? No, ten.

511
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:26,499
Oh dear, that's no good. See.

512
00:37:26,499 --> 00:37:28,159
These are from our winter stock,

513
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:30,159
where supply and demand have a big problem.

514
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:32,459
You want to talk about a supply and demand problem?

515
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,129
I sell ice for a living.

516
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:36,089
Ooh, that's a rough business to be in right now.

517
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:38,049
I mean, that is really...

518
00:37:38,379 --> 00:37:39,709
Ahem. That's unfortunate.

519
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:41,589
Still forty. But I will throw in a

520
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:43,429
visit to Oaken's sauna. Hoo hoo!

521
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:45,719
Hi, family.

522
00:37:47,379 --> 00:37:50,099
Ten's all I got. Help me out.

523
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,719
Ten will get you this and no more.

524
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:54,389
Okay, just tell me one thing...What was

525
00:37:54,389 --> 00:37:56,019
...happening on the North Mountain?

526
00:37:56,019 --> 00:37:58,019
Did it seem magical?

527
00:37:58,939 --> 00:38:01,359
Yes! Now, back up

528
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,269
while I deal with this crook here.

529
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:08,359
What did you call me?

530
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:10,989
Okay. Okay, I'm-Ow! Whoa!

531
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:13,529
Bye bye.

532
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:20,659
No Sven, I didn't get your carrots.

533
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:23,709
But I did find us a place to sleep.

534
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:25,709
And it's free.

535
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:28,629
I'm sorry about this violence.

536
00:38:28,629 --> 00:38:30,379
I will add a quart of lutefisk,

537
00:38:30,379 --> 00:38:32,169
So We'll have good feelings.

538
00:38:32,169 --> 00:38:34,339
Just the outfit and boots, yah?

539
00:38:44,759 --> 00:38:48,389
Reindeers are better than people.

540
00:38:48,389 --> 00:38:51,979
Sven, Don't you think that's true?

541
00:38:51,979 --> 00:38:55,269
Yeah, People will beat you & Curse you & Cheat you.

542
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:58,069
Every one of em's bad, Except you.

543
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,069
Oh, Thanks, Buddy.

544
00:39:00,149 --> 00:39:03,399
But People smell better than Reindeers.

545
00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:07,409
Sven, Don't you think I'm right?

546
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:11,369
That's once again true, For all Except you.

547
00:39:11,369 --> 00:39:14,449
You got me. Let's call it a night.

548
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:16,919
Good night.

549
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:21,079
Don't let the Frostbite bite.

550
00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:26,049
Nice duet.

551
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:27,419
Oh, it's just you.

552
00:39:27,709 --> 00:39:29,339
What do you want?

553
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:31,799
I want you to take me up the North Mountain.

554
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:37,059
I don't take people places.

555
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:38,679
Let me rephrase that...

556
00:39:40,969 --> 00:39:42,479
Take me up the North Mountain...

557
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:43,979
Please.

558
00:39:50,109 --> 00:39:52,189
Look, I know how to stop this winter.

559
00:39:54,689 --> 00:39:56,239
We leave at Dawn...

560
00:39:56,609 --> 00:39:58,949
And you forgot the carrots for Sven.

561
00:40:00,449 --> 00:40:02,569
Oops. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...

562
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:06,659
We leave now. Right now.

563
00:40:18,299 --> 00:40:20,379
Hang on! We like to go fast!

564
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:21,419
I like fast!

565
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,679
Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down. This is fresh lacquer.

566
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:26,429
Seriously, were you raised in a barn?

567
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,549
Ew. No, I was raised in a castle.

568
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:35,679
So tell me, what made the Queen go all ice-crazy?

569
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:38,849
Oh well, it was all my fault.

570
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:41,309
I got engaged but then she freaked out because...

571
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:43,649
I'd only just met him, you know, that day.

572
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,649
And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage...

573
00:40:45,649 --> 00:40:49,489
Wait. You got engaged to someone you just met?

574
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,109
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she got mad.

575
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:53,369
And then she tried to walk away,

576
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:54,659
and I grabbed her glove...

577
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:56,409
Hang on. You mean to tell me.

578
00:40:56,409 --> 00:41:00,789
You got engaged to someone you just met?!

579
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:02,999
Yes. Pay attention. But the thing is...

580
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:05,209
she wore the gloves all the time,

581
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:07,329
So I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt.

582
00:41:07,459 --> 00:41:10,959
Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?

583
00:41:11,459 --> 00:41:13,379
Yes, they did...

584
00:41:13,549 --> 00:41:15,969
But Hans is not a stranger.

585
00:41:15,969 --> 00:41:18,339
Oh yeah? What's his last name?

586
00:41:18,629 --> 00:41:20,509
...Of-the-Southern-Isles?

587
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:21,969
What's his favorite food? Sandwiches.

588
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:23,429
Best friend's name? Probably John.

589
00:41:23,429 --> 00:41:24,639
Eye color...Dreamy.

590
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:26,269
Foot size? Foot size doesn't matter.

591
00:41:26,269 --> 00:41:27,599
Have you had a meal with him yet?

592
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,979
What if you hate the way he eats?

593
00:41:28,979 --> 00:41:30,689
What if you hate the way he picks his nose?

594
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:31,889
Picks his nose?

595
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:32,979
And eats it.

596
00:41:32,979 --> 00:41:35,649
Excuse me, Sir. He's a Prince.

597
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:37,649
All men do it.

598
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,569
Ew. Look it doesn't matter, it's true love.

599
00:41:41,569 --> 00:41:43,659
Doesn't sound like true love.

600
00:41:43,659 --> 00:41:45,699
Are you some sort of love expert?

601
00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:48,869
No. But I have friends who are.

602
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:51,199
You have friends who are love experts?

603
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:53,329
I'm not buying it...Stop talking.

604
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:54,829
No, no, no. I'd like to meet these...

605
00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:56,329
No, I mean it.

606
00:41:57,369 --> 00:41:58,209
SHHH.

607
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:12,719
Sven, go. Go!

608
00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:15,309
What are they? Wolves.

609
00:42:15,389 --> 00:42:16,219
Wolves?

610
00:42:19,059 --> 00:42:20,599
What do we do? I've got this.

611
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:22,849
You just... don't fall off and don't get eaten.

612
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:24,349
But I wanna help...No.

613
00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:25,229
Why not?

614
00:42:25,229 --> 00:42:26,099
Because I don't trust your judgment.

615
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:27,559
Excuse me?!

616
00:42:27,649 --> 00:42:29,229
Who marries a man she just met?

617
00:42:29,229 --> 00:42:30,979
It's true love!

618
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:35,029
Christopher!

619
00:42:35,029 --> 00:42:36,699
It's Kristoff!

620
00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:42,449
Duck!

621
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:48,749
- You almost set me on fire!
- But I didn't.

622
00:42:55,419 --> 00:42:56,789
Get ready to jump, Sven!

623
00:42:56,789 --> 00:42:58,169
You don't tell him what to do!

624
00:42:58,879 --> 00:43:01,629
I do! Jump, Sven!

625
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:18,649
But I just paid it off.

626
00:43:18,979 --> 00:43:23,269
Uh-oh. No, no, no.

627
00:43:23,439 --> 00:43:25,109
Grab on!

628
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:27,109
Pull, Sven! Pull!

629
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:41,699
I'll replace your sled and everything in it.

630
00:43:43,419 --> 00:43:47,329
And I understand if you don't want to help me anymore.

631
00:43:52,759 --> 00:43:54,839
Of course I don't want to help her anymore.

632
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:57,179
In fact, this whole thing has ruined me.

633
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:59,509
For helping anyone ever again.

634
00:44:00,009 --> 00:44:03,599
- But she'll die on her own.
- I can live with that.

635
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:08,389
But you won't get your new sled if she's dead.

636
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,729
You know sometimes I really don't like you.

637
00:44:10,979 --> 00:44:13,109
Hold up. We're coming.

638
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:14,359
You are?!

639
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:18,439
I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along.

640
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:32,499
Arendelle...It's completely frozen.

641
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:37,289
But it'll be fine. Elsa will thaw it.

642
00:44:37,289 --> 00:44:39,329
Will she? Yeah.

643
00:44:39,329 --> 00:44:41,709
Now come on. This way to the North Mountain?

644
00:44:43,299 --> 00:44:45,959
More like this way.

645
00:45:17,489 --> 00:45:21,319
I never knew winter could be so beautiful.

646
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:25,579
YEAH... It really is beautiful, isn't it?

647
00:45:25,749 --> 00:45:27,789
But it's so white.

648
00:45:27,789 --> 00:45:29,499
You know, how about a little color?

649
00:45:29,499 --> 00:45:33,039
I'm thinking like maybe some crimson, chartreuse...

650
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:35,839
How 'bout yellow...no, not yellow.

651
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,549
Yellow and snow? Brrrr... no go.

652
00:45:42,129 --> 00:45:44,049
Am I right?

653
00:45:44,049 --> 00:45:45,429
Hi! You're creepy.

654
00:45:45,759 --> 00:45:47,429
I don't want it! Backatchya!

655
00:45:47,509 --> 00:45:49,099
- Please don't drop me.
- Come on, it's just a head.

656
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:50,099
Don't!

657
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:51,099
All right, we got off to a bad start.

658
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:53,059
Ew, ew, the body!

659
00:45:56,189 --> 00:45:57,649
Wait, what am I looking at right now?

660
00:45:57,649 --> 00:45:59,519
Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?

661
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:02,609
...Al'right. Wait one second.

662
00:46:03,899 --> 00:46:06,489
Oooh! Thank you! You're welcome.

663
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:08,819
Now I'm perfect.

664
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:10,239
Well, almost.

665
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:12,239
It was like my whole life got upside down.

666
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:14,869
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry! I was just...

667
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:16,409
Woo! Head Rush! Are you okay?

668
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:19,869
Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!

669
00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:21,619
I've always wanted a nose.

670
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:24,869
So cute. It's like a little baby unicorn.

671
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:26,999
What? Hey! Whoa.

672
00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:29,169
Oh, I love it even more! Hah...

673
00:46:29,959 --> 00:46:32,209
All right, let's start this thing over.

674
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:36,799
Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I like warm hugs.

675
00:46:37,259 --> 00:46:38,429
Olaf?

676
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:43,639
That's right, Olaf.

677
00:46:44,389 --> 00:46:47,389
And you are?

678
00:46:47,929 --> 00:46:49,309
Oh, um... I'm Anna.

679
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:51,649
And who's the funky-looking donkey over there?

680
00:46:51,649 --> 00:46:53,309
That's Sven.

681
00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:54,979
Uh-huh. And who's the reindeer?

682
00:46:55,189 --> 00:46:56,439
Sven.

683
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:59,109
They're...oh, okay...Makes things easier for me.

684
00:47:00,399 --> 00:47:01,859
Ha. Aw, look at him tryin' to kiss my nose.

685
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:03,359
I like you, too!

686
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,609
Olaf, Did Elsa build you?

687
00:47:05,609 --> 00:47:06,819
Yeah. Why?

688
00:47:06,819 --> 00:47:08,819
You know where she is? Yeah. Why?

689
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,449
Do you think you could show us the way?

690
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:12,619
Yeah. Why? How does this work?

691
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,289
Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus here.

692
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:17,869
Yeah, Why? I'll tell you Why.

693
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:19,879
We need Elsa to Bring back Summer.

694
00:47:19,959 --> 00:47:21,499
Summer? Uhum.

695
00:47:21,669 --> 00:47:23,339
Oh, I don't know why but.

696
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:26,459
I've always loved the idea of summer,

697
00:47:26,709 --> 00:47:30,219
And Sun, and all things hot.

698
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:31,389
Really?

699
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:33,509
I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.

700
00:47:33,889 --> 00:47:35,259
Nope!

701
00:47:35,259 --> 00:47:38,139
But sometimes I like to close my eyes

702
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:41,639
and imagine what it'd be like when summer does come.

703
00:47:44,769 --> 00:47:49,029
Bees'll Buzz, Kids'll blow dandelion fuzz.

704
00:47:49,029 --> 00:47:53,859
And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer.

705
00:47:55,649 --> 00:48:00,199
A drink in my hand, My snow up against the burning sand.

706
00:48:00,279 --> 00:48:04,329
Prob'ly getting gorgeously tanned in Summer.

707
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:06,749
I'll finally see a summer breeze,

708
00:48:06,749 --> 00:48:08,659
blow away a winter storm.

709
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:10,709
And find out what happens to

710
00:48:10,709 --> 00:48:14,169
solid water, When it gets warm.

711
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:20,009
And I can't wait to see, what my buddies all think of me.

712
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:24,969
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summer!

713
00:48:29,889 --> 00:48:31,809
The hot and the cold are both so intense,

714
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:34,389
Put 'em together, It just makes sense!

715
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:40,559
Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle,

716
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,569
But put me in summer and I'll be a...

717
00:48:43,899 --> 00:48:45,649
Happy Snowman!

718
00:48:45,649 --> 00:48:49,279
When life gets rough I like to hold on to my dream

719
00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:54,329
of relaxing in the summer sun just letting off steam!

720
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,659
Oh the sky will be Blue...

721
00:48:59,659 --> 00:49:03,289
And you guys'll be there too.

722
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:08,709
When I finally do what frozen things do in Summer!

723
00:49:08,959 --> 00:49:11,049
- I'm gonna tell him.
- Don't you dare.

724
00:49:12,009 --> 00:49:12,719
In Summer!

725
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:22,059
So, Come on! Elsa's this way.

726
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,809
Let's go bring back summer!

727
00:49:24,809 --> 00:49:26,389
I'm coming!

728
00:49:27,729 --> 00:49:29,439
Somebody's got to tell him.

729
00:49:34,649 --> 00:49:37,029
No. No. You've got the bark facing down.

730
00:49:37,029 --> 00:49:38,819
The bark needs to be face-up.

731
00:49:39,149 --> 00:49:40,699
Bark down is drier.

732
00:49:40,699 --> 00:49:42,149
Bark up...Bark down.

733
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:44,199
Cloak. Does anyone need a cloak?

734
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:47,279
Arendelle is indebted to you, Your Highness.

735
00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:49,579
The castle is open. There's soup

736
00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:51,869
and hot glogg in the Great Hall.

737
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:53,159
Here. Pass these out.

738
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:54,869
Prince Hans, are we just

739
00:49:54,869 --> 00:49:56,629
expected to sit here and freeze

740
00:49:56,629 --> 00:49:59,999
while you give away all of Arendelle's Tradable goods?

741
00:49:59,999 --> 00:50:01,589
Princess Anna has given her orders and...

742
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:03,209
And that's another thing,

743
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:05,129
has it dawned on you that your Princess

744
00:50:05,129 --> 00:50:07,049
may be conspiring with a wicked sorceress...

745
00:50:07,049 --> 00:50:08,259
to destroy us all?

746
00:50:08,259 --> 00:50:11,759
Do not question the Princess. She left me in charge,

747
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,259
and I will not hesitate to

748
00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:14,719
protect Arendelle from treason.

749
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:17,009
Treason?!

750
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:24,939
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy.

751
00:50:27,189 --> 00:50:30,359
Princess Anna's horse. What happened to her? Where is she?

752
00:50:31,189 --> 00:50:33,399
Princess Anna is in trouble.

753
00:50:33,399 --> 00:50:36,239
I need volunteers to go with me to find her!

754
00:50:36,279 --> 00:50:39,659
I volunteer two men, my Lord!

755
00:50:39,779 --> 00:50:41,659
Be prepared for anything,

756
00:50:41,659 --> 00:50:43,989
And should you encounter the Queen,

757
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:47,539
You are to put an end to this winter.

758
00:50:47,539 --> 00:50:49,499
Do you understand?

759
00:50:53,289 --> 00:50:56,419
So how exactly are you planning to stop this weather?

760
00:50:56,669 --> 00:50:59,299
Oh, I am gonna talk to my sister.

761
00:50:59,299 --> 00:51:01,339
That's your plan? My ice business is

762
00:51:01,339 --> 00:51:03,429
riding on you talking to your sister.

763
00:51:03,469 --> 00:51:05,099
Yup.

764
00:51:05,139 --> 00:51:07,139
So you're not at all afraid of her?

765
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:08,969
Why would I be? Yeah.

766
00:51:08,969 --> 00:51:12,059
I bet Elsa's the nicest, gentlest,

767
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:14,059
Warmest person ever.

768
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:15,809
Oh, look at that.

769
00:51:15,809 --> 00:51:17,439
I've been impaled.

770
00:51:22,269 --> 00:51:23,899
What now?

771
00:51:26,779 --> 00:51:28,529
It's too steep. I've only got one rope,

772
00:51:28,529 --> 00:51:30,279
And you don't know how to climb mountains.

773
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:32,119
Says who?

774
00:51:33,409 --> 00:51:34,739
What are you doing?

775
00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:38,739
I'm going to see my sister.

776
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:42,869
You're going to kill yourself. I wouldn't put my foot there.

777
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:44,749
You're distracting me...Or there.

778
00:51:44,749 --> 00:51:46,919
How do you know Elsa even wants to see you?

779
00:51:46,919 --> 00:51:48,629
I'm just blocking you out 'cause

780
00:51:48,629 --> 00:51:50,669
I gotta concentrate here.

781
00:51:51,459 --> 00:51:53,089
You know, most people who disappear

782
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:54,799
into the mountains want to be alone.

783
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:58,349
Nobody wants to be alone. Except maybe you...

784
00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:01,889
I'm not alone...I have friends, remember?

785
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:04,599
You mean the love experts?

786
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:06,729
Yes, the love experts!

787
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:11,229
Please tell me I'm almost there.

788
00:52:12,189 --> 00:52:14,649
Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here?

789
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:18,439
Hang on...Hey, Sven?

790
00:52:18,439 --> 00:52:20,989
Not sure if this is going to solve the problem, but I found

791
00:52:21,029 --> 00:52:23,449
a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go.

792
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:26,619
Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!

793
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:30,489
Thanks! That was like a crazy trust exercise.

794
00:52:44,879 --> 00:52:48,429
Now that's ice. I might cry.

795
00:52:48,429 --> 00:52:51,839
Go ahead. I won't judge.

796
00:52:59,019 --> 00:53:02,389
All right, take it easy. Come here, I gotcha.

797
00:53:02,809 --> 00:53:05,349
Okay. You stay right here, buddy.

798
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:08,569
Flawless.

799
00:53:13,529 --> 00:53:16,319
Knock... Just knock...

800
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:19,779
Why isn't she knocking...?

801
00:53:20,529 --> 00:53:22,989
Do you think she knows how to knock?

802
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:30,579
It opened. That's a first.

803
00:53:31,789 --> 00:53:33,589
You should probably wait out here.

804
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:34,129
What?

805
00:53:34,129 --> 00:53:36,089
Last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything.

806
00:53:36,089 --> 00:53:40,669
But. But...Oh come on, It's a palace made of ice.

807
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:42,969
Ice is my life...Bye, Sven.

808
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,929
You too, Olaf.

809
00:53:44,929 --> 00:53:47,219
Me? Just give us a minute.

810
00:53:47,219 --> 00:53:48,599
Okay.

811
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,979
One... two... Three... four...

812
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:09,739
Elsa? It's me... Anna.

813
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:14,779
Anna?

814
00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:22,209
Wow... Elsa, you look different...

815
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:25,959
It's a good different...And this place.

816
00:54:25,959 --> 00:54:28,379
Is amazing...Thank you.

817
00:54:28,919 --> 00:54:31,169
I never knew what I was capable of.

818
00:54:31,799 --> 00:54:34,509
I'm so sorry about what happened. If I'd known...

819
00:54:34,509 --> 00:54:35,969
No, it's okay.

820
00:54:36,589 --> 00:54:38,719
You don't have to apologize.

821
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:41,469
But you should probably go, please.

822
00:54:41,929 --> 00:54:43,849
But I just got here.

823
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:45,729
You belong in Arendelle.

824
00:54:45,769 --> 00:54:49,059
So do you...No, Anna. I belong here.

825
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:51,359
Alone.

826
00:54:51,609 --> 00:54:53,769
Where I can be who I am,

827
00:54:54,229 --> 00:54:55,899
Without hurting anybody.

828
00:54:55,979 --> 00:54:58,529
Actually, about that...58... 59... 60.

829
00:54:59,069 --> 00:55:00,949
Wait. What is that?

830
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:03,819
Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

831
00:55:04,109 --> 00:55:05,819
Olaf?

832
00:55:06,109 --> 00:55:08,949
You Built me. You remember that?

833
00:55:09,449 --> 00:55:11,079
And You're alive?

834
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,539
Um... I think so?

835
00:55:15,169 --> 00:55:17,539
He's just like the one we built as kids.

836
00:55:18,749 --> 00:55:20,129
Yeah!

837
00:55:20,339 --> 00:55:22,459
So we were so close.

838
00:55:22,709 --> 00:55:24,709
We can be like that again.

839
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:28,469
Slow Down...

840
00:55:30,929 --> 00:55:32,679
Anna!

841
00:55:35,309 --> 00:55:37,349
No, We can't.

842
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,269
Goodbye, Anna...Elsa, wait...

843
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:41,769
No, I'm just trying to protect you.

844
00:55:41,769 --> 00:55:44,439
You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid.

845
00:55:45,229 --> 00:55:47,439
Please don't shut me out again.

846
00:55:47,439 --> 00:55:49,439
Please don't slam the door.

847
00:55:49,439 --> 00:55:53,359
You don't have to keep your distance anymore.

848
00:55:53,609 --> 00:55:56,489
'Cause for the first time in forever,

849
00:55:56,659 --> 00:55:58,829
I finally understand.

850
00:55:58,829 --> 00:56:03,289
For the first time in forever, We can fix this hand in hand.

851
00:56:03,289 --> 00:56:05,539
We can head down this mountain Together.

852
00:56:05,539 --> 00:56:08,579
You don't have to live in fear.

853
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:12,459
'Cause for the first time in forever,

854
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:16,049
I will be right here.

855
00:56:16,049 --> 00:56:19,009
Anna, Please go back home.

856
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:21,049
Your life awaits.

857
00:56:21,629 --> 00:56:25,219
Go enjoy the sun And open up the gates.

858
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:28,799
Yeah, But...I know! You mean well,

859
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,269
But leave me be.

860
00:56:31,269 --> 00:56:35,349
Yes, I'm alone. But I'm alone and Free.

861
00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:40,399
Just stay away and you'll be safe from me.

862
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:43,359
- Actually, We're not.
- What do you mean You're not?

863
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:44,989
I get the feeling you don't know?

864
00:56:44,989 --> 00:56:46,739
What do I not know?

865
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:51,989
Arendelle's in deep deep deep deep snow.

866
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,199
What?

867
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:58,289
You kind of set off an eternal winter...everywhere.

868
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,699
Everywhere?

869
00:56:59,699 --> 00:57:00,869
It's okay, you can just unfreeze it.

870
00:57:00,869 --> 00:57:02,039
No, I can't.

871
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:04,829
I don't know how...Sure you can.

872
00:57:04,829 --> 00:57:06,209
I know you can!

873
00:57:06,209 --> 00:57:10,339
'Cause for the first time in forever,

874
00:57:10,339 --> 00:57:12,879
I'm such a Fool! I can't be Free!

875
00:57:13,089 --> 00:57:15,429
You don't have to be afraid.

876
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:17,929
No escape From the storm inside of me!

877
00:57:17,929 --> 00:57:20,099
We can work this out together.

878
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:21,969
I can't control the curse!

879
00:57:21,969 --> 00:57:25,689
We'll reverse the storm you've made.

880
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:28,389
Anna, Please, You'll only make it worse!

881
00:57:28,389 --> 00:57:29,309
Don't panic.

882
00:57:29,309 --> 00:57:30,599
There's so much fear!

883
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:32,309
We'll make the sun shine bright.

884
00:57:32,399 --> 00:57:33,399
You're not safe here!

885
00:57:33,399 --> 00:57:35,319
We can face this thing together...

886
00:57:41,489 --> 00:57:44,909
I can't!

887
00:57:52,209 --> 00:57:54,869
Anna. Are you okay?

888
00:57:55,329 --> 00:57:59,039
I'm okay... I'm fine...Who's this?

889
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,129
Wait, it doesn't matter. Just...You have to go.

890
00:58:02,129 --> 00:58:05,129
No, I know we can figure this out together...

891
00:58:05,129 --> 00:58:08,469
How? What power do you have to stop this winter?

892
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:09,839
To stop me?

893
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,219
Anna, I think we should go.

894
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:13,549
No. I'm not leaving without you, Elsa.

895
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:15,929
Yes, you are.

896
00:58:24,019 --> 00:58:25,899
Stop. Put us down!

897
00:58:26,059 --> 00:58:27,569
Go away!

898
00:58:31,069 --> 00:58:32,609
Heads up!

899
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:35,449
Watch out for my butt!

900
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:39,069
It is not nice to throw people!

901
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:40,909
Wow, Wow, Wow Feisty pants. Ok, Relax.

902
00:58:40,909 --> 00:58:42,659
Just Calm down. Calm down.

903
00:58:42,659 --> 00:58:43,579
All Right. I'm Okay.

904
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:44,789
Just let the snow man be.

905
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:46,289
I'm Calm...Great.

906
00:58:46,579 --> 00:58:47,789
Oh... Come on!

907
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:53,669
Uh-oh. See. Now you made him mad!

908
00:58:53,669 --> 00:58:54,709
I'll distract him.

909
00:58:54,709 --> 00:58:56,709
You guys go.

910
00:58:56,709 --> 00:58:59,009
No, no, not you guys.

911
00:58:59,799 --> 00:59:01,549
This just got a whole lot harder.

912
00:59:19,729 --> 00:59:21,359
What are you doing?

913
00:59:24,819 --> 00:59:26,239
I got him!

914
00:59:27,899 --> 00:59:29,529
It's a hundred foot drop.

915
00:59:29,779 --> 00:59:31,159
It's two hundred.

916
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,079
- What's that for?
- I'm digging a snow anchor.

917
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:37,409
Okay. What if we fall?

918
00:59:37,409 --> 00:59:39,329
There's twenty feet of fresh powder down there.

919
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:41,249
It'll be like landing on a pillow...

920
00:59:41,249 --> 00:59:42,919
Hopefully.

921
00:59:45,379 --> 00:59:47,209
Okay, Anna. On three.

922
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:49,379
One...Okay. You tell me when...

923
00:59:49,379 --> 00:59:51,509
Two...I'm ready to go...I was born ready! Yes!

924
00:59:51,509 --> 00:59:52,969
Calm down.

925
00:59:55,299 --> 00:59:56,679
Tree!

926
00:59:56,679 --> 01:00:01,759
What the... Whoa! That happened.

927
01:00:03,269 --> 01:00:05,729
Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape.

928
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:12,479
There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven!

929
01:00:12,479 --> 01:00:15,569
Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost Marshmallow back there!

930
01:00:16,569 --> 01:00:18,989
Hey. We were just talking about you.

931
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:21,739
Ll good things, all good things.

932
01:00:21,739 --> 01:00:23,109
No!

933
01:00:25,949 --> 01:00:29,079
This is not making much of a difference! Is it?

934
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:31,869
Olaf!

935
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:35,619
Hang in there, guys! Go Faster!

936
01:00:36,169 --> 01:00:37,999
Wait, what?

937
01:00:44,379 --> 01:00:45,719
Kristoff!

938
01:00:47,549 --> 01:00:50,259
Don't come back!

939
01:00:50,259 --> 01:00:52,009
We won't.

940
01:00:59,309 --> 01:01:02,019
Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow.

941
01:01:02,809 --> 01:01:04,019
Olaf!

942
01:01:04,399 --> 01:01:07,479
I can't feel my legs!

943
01:01:08,689 --> 01:01:10,319
Those are my legs.

944
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,239
Ooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt.

945
01:01:12,689 --> 01:01:14,449
Oh, That feels better.

946
01:01:14,699 --> 01:01:17,069
Hey, Sven! He found us.

947
01:01:17,069 --> 01:01:19,159
Who's my cute little reindeer?

948
01:01:19,159 --> 01:01:21,199
Don't talk to him like that.

949
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:25,579
Here.

950
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:28,579
You okay? Thank you.

951
01:01:30,249 --> 01:01:31,839
Um... How's your head?

952
01:01:33,129 --> 01:01:34,589
I mean, It's fine. Ah... I'm good.

953
01:01:34,589 --> 01:01:36,089
Ha. I've got a thick skull.

954
01:01:36,089 --> 01:01:39,839
I don't have a skull...Or bones.

955
01:01:40,089 --> 01:01:41,849
So...

956
01:01:41,929 --> 01:01:44,349
So Now what? Now what?

957
01:01:44,849 --> 01:01:46,309
Now what?!

958
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:49,519
Oooh! What am I gonna do?

959
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:51,519
She threw me out. I can't go back to.

960
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:53,519
Arendelle with the weather like this.

961
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:54,479
And then there's your ice business...

962
01:01:54,479 --> 01:01:57,019
Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice business...

963
01:01:57,769 --> 01:01:59,729
Worry about your hair? What?

964
01:01:59,729 --> 01:02:01,689
Just fell off a Cliff. You should see your hair.

965
01:02:01,689 --> 01:02:06,029
- No, yours is turning white.
- White? It's... what?

966
01:02:06,279 --> 01:02:08,739
It's because she struck you, isn't it?

967
01:02:08,909 --> 01:02:10,739
Does it look bad?

968
01:02:11,659 --> 01:02:13,119
No. You hesitated.

969
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:16,539
No, I didn't. Anna, you need help. Okay? Come on.

970
01:02:16,539 --> 01:02:19,919
Okay! Where are we going? To see my friends.

971
01:02:19,919 --> 01:02:22,749
The love experts? Love experts?!

972
01:02:22,749 --> 01:02:25,209
And don't worry, they'll be able to fix this.

973
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:27,169
How do you know?

974
01:02:27,709 --> 01:02:29,839
Because I've seen them do it before.

975
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:33,679
I like to consider myself a love expert.

976
01:02:37,889 --> 01:02:41,259
Get it together. Control it.

977
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:45,559
Don't feel. Don't feel.

978
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:47,639
Don't feel!

979
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:04,739
Look, Sven. The sky's awake.

980
01:03:07,539 --> 01:03:10,039
Are you cold? A little.

981
01:03:12,579 --> 01:03:14,539
Wait. Come here.

982
01:03:18,379 --> 01:03:21,419
So, About my friends...

983
01:03:21,959 --> 01:03:24,969
Well, I say friends, they're more like family...

984
01:03:25,419 --> 01:03:27,879
Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven

985
01:03:27,879 --> 01:03:30,299
until you know, they took us in.

986
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:32,719
They did? Yeah.

987
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:34,509
I don't want to scare you, they can be

988
01:03:34,509 --> 01:03:36,309
a little bit inappropriate...

989
01:03:36,309 --> 01:03:39,729
And loud... very loud...

990
01:03:39,729 --> 01:03:42,099
They're also stubborn at times, And a little.

991
01:03:42,099 --> 01:03:46,359
Overbearing. And heavy. Really, really heavy. Which you...

992
01:03:46,359 --> 01:03:48,359
But You know, you okay. They're fine. They mean well.

993
01:03:48,359 --> 01:03:50,779
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

994
01:03:52,399 --> 01:03:55,029
Okay then...

995
01:03:55,029 --> 01:03:57,579
Meet my family.

996
01:03:57,579 --> 01:03:59,239
Hey, guys!

997
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:00,829
They're rocks.

998
01:04:02,749 --> 01:04:06,539
He's crazy.

999
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:11,629
Hey, Wow...I pretty Recognize you, What's so much Weigh?

1000
01:04:12,039 --> 01:04:14,959
I'll distract them while you run.

1001
01:04:15,049 --> 01:04:19,719
Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to meet you!

1002
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:22,549
Anna, because I love you, I insist you run.

1003
01:04:22,549 --> 01:04:26,349
Understand you're love experts!

1004
01:04:26,849 --> 01:04:28,889
Why aren't you running?

1005
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:32,309
Okay. Um... I'm gonna go...

1006
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:34,769
No, no, no. Anna, wait!

1007
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:38,399
Kristoff!

1008
01:04:43,069 --> 01:04:44,899
Kristoff's home!

1009
01:04:44,899 --> 01:04:46,989
Kristoff! Kristoff's home! It's been too long!

1010
01:04:46,989 --> 01:04:49,069
Kristoff's home!

1011
01:04:49,069 --> 01:04:50,989
Wait? Kristoff?

1012
01:04:50,989 --> 01:04:52,869
Yeah...Oh, let me look at you!

1013
01:04:52,869 --> 01:04:54,619
Oh, take off your clothes, Kristoff, I wash them.

1014
01:04:54,619 --> 01:04:56,249
Ah! No. I'm gonna keep my clothes on, Look.

1015
01:04:56,249 --> 01:04:57,909
Great to see you all.

1016
01:04:57,909 --> 01:05:00,209
But where's grand Pabbie? He's napping.

1017
01:05:00,209 --> 01:05:01,959
But look, I grew a mushroom.

1018
01:05:01,959 --> 01:05:03,669
And I earned my fire Crystal.

1019
01:05:03,669 --> 01:05:05,129
I passed a kidney Stone.

1020
01:05:05,169 --> 01:05:06,549
Kristoff, Pick me up.

1021
01:05:06,549 --> 01:05:09,209
You're getting big...Good for you.

1022
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:11,719
Trolls? They're trolls.

1023
01:05:14,259 --> 01:05:19,009
He's brought a girl!

1024
01:05:21,889 --> 01:05:23,019
What's going on?

1025
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:24,349
I've learned to just roll with it.

1026
01:05:24,429 --> 01:05:27,979
Let me see. Bright eyes. Working nose. Strong teeth.

1027
01:05:27,979 --> 01:05:31,439
Yes, yes, yes. She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.

1028
01:05:31,439 --> 01:05:32,269
Wait. Oh. Um. No.

1029
01:05:32,269 --> 01:05:34,939
You've got the wrong idea. That's not why I brought her here.

1030
01:05:34,939 --> 01:05:37,239
Right. We're not. I'm not...

1031
01:05:37,239 --> 01:05:39,199
What's the issue, dear?

1032
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:42,359
Why are you holding back from such a man?

1033
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:43,449
Is it the clumpy way he walks?

1034
01:05:43,449 --> 01:05:44,569
What?

1035
01:05:44,569 --> 01:05:46,739
Or the Grumpy way he talks? No.

1036
01:05:46,739 --> 01:05:48,449
Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped

1037
01:05:48,449 --> 01:05:50,119
...weirdness of his feet? Hey!

1038
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:53,369
And though we know he washes well

1039
01:05:53,409 --> 01:05:55,749
he always ends up Sorta smelly.

1040
01:05:55,749 --> 01:05:59,749
But You'll never meet a fella who's as sensitive and sweet.

1041
01:05:59,749 --> 01:06:00,499
That's nice.

1042
01:06:00,499 --> 01:06:02,509
So he's a bit of a fixer upper,

1043
01:06:02,509 --> 01:06:04,589
So he's got a few flaws,

1044
01:06:04,589 --> 01:06:06,839
His peculiar brain, Dear. His thing for the reindeer.

1045
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:09,259
- That outside a few of nature's laws.
- This is not about me!

1046
01:06:09,259 --> 01:06:11,429
So he's a bit of a fixer upper,

1047
01:06:11,429 --> 01:06:13,679
But this we're certain of...

1048
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:18,019
You Can fix this fixer upper up with a little bit of love.

1049
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,519
Can we just stop talking about this?!

1050
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:22,729
We've got a real, actual problem here.

1051
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:27,439
I'll Say...So tell me dear, Is it
the way that he runs scared?

1052
01:06:27,439 --> 01:06:29,739
Or that he's Socially Impaired?

1053
01:06:29,739 --> 01:06:32,899
Or that he only likes to tinkle in the Woods?

1054
01:06:32,899 --> 01:06:34,029
I do not need to know that.

1055
01:06:34,029 --> 01:06:36,449
Are you holding back your fondness.

1056
01:06:36,449 --> 01:06:38,949
Due to his unmanly blondeness?

1057
01:06:38,949 --> 01:06:42,699
Or the way he covers up that he's the honest goods?

1058
01:06:43,659 --> 01:06:45,329
He's just a bit of a fixer upper.

1059
01:06:45,329 --> 01:06:47,039
He's got a couple a' bugs.

1060
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:48,039
No, I don't.

1061
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:50,209
His isolation is confirmation of

1062
01:06:50,209 --> 01:06:52,289
his desperation for healing hugs.

1063
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:57,009
So he's a bit of a fixer upper, But we know what to do.

1064
01:06:57,299 --> 01:06:59,169
The way to fix up this fixer

1065
01:06:59,169 --> 01:07:01,049
...upper is to fix him up with you.

1066
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:04,599
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Enough!

1067
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:07,469
She's engaged to someone else. Okay?!

1068
01:07:10,809 --> 01:07:13,389
So she's a bit of a fixer upper,

1069
01:07:13,389 --> 01:07:15,099
That's a minor thing.

1070
01:07:15,099 --> 01:07:17,559
This quote “engagement” Is a flex arrangement.

1071
01:07:17,559 --> 01:07:20,269
And by the way, I don't see no Ring.

1072
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:22,279
So she's a bit of a fixer upper,

1073
01:07:22,279 --> 01:07:24,279
Her brain's a bit betwixt.

1074
01:07:24,279 --> 01:07:26,529
Get the fiance out of the way And

1075
01:07:26,529 --> 01:07:28,739
the whole thing will be fixed!

1076
01:07:30,869 --> 01:07:32,829
We aren't saying you can change him.

1077
01:07:32,829 --> 01:07:34,909
'Cause people don't really change.

1078
01:07:35,699 --> 01:07:37,909
We're only saying that love's a force.

1079
01:07:37,909 --> 01:07:40,169
That's powerful and strange.

1080
01:07:40,459 --> 01:07:42,879
People make bad choices if they're

1081
01:07:42,879 --> 01:07:45,299
mad or scared or stressed.

1082
01:07:45,299 --> 01:07:47,709
But throw a little love their way...

1083
01:07:47,709 --> 01:07:50,169
throw a little love their way.

1084
01:07:50,169 --> 01:07:52,419
And you'll bring out their best!

1085
01:07:52,419 --> 01:07:54,679
True love brings out the best!

1086
01:07:54,679 --> 01:07:57,179
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper,

1087
01:07:57,179 --> 01:07:59,059
That's what it's all about.

1088
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:02,179
Father, Sister, Brother We need each other

1089
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:04,769
to raise us up and round us out.

1090
01:08:04,889 --> 01:08:07,599
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper,

1091
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:10,309
But when push comes to shove.

1092
01:08:10,479 --> 01:08:12,769
The only fixer upper fixer that can fix a fixer upper is.

1093
01:08:12,769 --> 01:08:18,109
True, True, True, True, Love.

1094
01:08:18,109 --> 01:08:23,029
Love, Love, Love, True Love...True-e-e-e-e-e.

1095
01:08:23,029 --> 01:08:26,989
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your trollfully wedded...

1096
01:08:26,989 --> 01:08:28,159
Wait, what?!

1097
01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:29,909
You're getting married.

1098
01:08:32,329 --> 01:08:34,039
She's as cold as ice.

1099
01:08:36,379 --> 01:08:38,709
There's strange magic here!

1100
01:08:38,709 --> 01:08:40,959
Grand Pabbie! Bring her to me.

1101
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:46,219
Anna, your life is in danger.

1102
01:08:46,219 --> 01:08:49,839
There is ice in your heart, put there by your sister.

1103
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:54,679
If not removed, to solid ice will you freeze, forever.

1104
01:08:54,889 --> 01:08:56,349
What ...? No.

1105
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:58,139
But you can remove it, Right?

1106
01:08:58,139 --> 01:08:59,849
I can not, I'm sorry Kristoff...

1107
01:08:59,849 --> 01:09:04,149
If it was her head that would be easy.

1108
01:09:04,149 --> 01:09:08,359
But only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart.

1109
01:09:09,069 --> 01:09:10,739
An act of true love?

1110
01:09:10,739 --> 01:09:13,529
A true love's kiss, perhaps?

1111
01:09:19,449 --> 01:09:21,949
Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans.

1112
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,079
Hans.

1113
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:24,709
Pull us out, Sven.

1114
01:09:27,249 --> 01:09:30,629
Olaf! Come on. I'm coming!

1115
01:09:30,629 --> 01:09:34,839
Let's go kiss Hans! Who is this Hans?!

1116
01:09:44,549 --> 01:09:46,429
We are here to find Princess Anna.

1117
01:09:46,429 --> 01:09:48,389
Be on guard,

1118
01:09:48,389 --> 01:09:51,059
but no harm is to come to the Queen.

1119
01:09:51,889 --> 01:09:54,019
Do you understand? Yes, Sir.

1120
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:17,869
The Queen.

1121
01:10:32,549 --> 01:10:34,889
Up there! Come on!

1122
01:10:38,549 --> 01:10:40,509
No, Please.

1123
01:10:46,559 --> 01:10:48,349
Stay away!

1124
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:51,559
Fire! Fire.

1125
01:10:51,649 --> 01:10:53,859
Get her! Get her!

1126
01:11:49,569 --> 01:11:51,319
Queen Elsa!

1127
01:11:51,319 --> 01:11:54,029
Don't be the monster they fear you are.

1128
01:12:41,609 --> 01:12:44,359
No... What have I done?

1129
01:12:50,909 --> 01:12:52,619
Why did you bring me here?

1130
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:54,659
I couldn't just let them kill you.

1131
01:12:54,659 --> 01:12:58,289
But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna.

1132
01:12:58,289 --> 01:13:00,629
Anna has not returned...

1133
01:13:01,829 --> 01:13:04,419
If you would just stop the winter,

1134
01:13:04,419 --> 01:13:07,049
bring back summer... please.

1135
01:13:07,879 --> 01:13:11,259
Don't you see... I can't.

1136
01:13:14,679 --> 01:13:17,719
You have to tell them to let me go.

1137
01:13:18,929 --> 01:13:21,099
I will do what I can.

1138
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:47,539
- Just hang in there.
- Come on, buddy, faster!

1139
01:13:55,129 --> 01:13:56,749
I'll meet you guys at the castle!

1140
01:13:56,749 --> 01:13:58,419
Stay out of sight, Olaf!

1141
01:13:58,419 --> 01:14:00,049
I will!

1142
01:14:12,059 --> 01:14:13,969
It's Princess Anna!

1143
01:14:21,899 --> 01:14:24,359
Are you g-gonna be okay?

1144
01:14:25,899 --> 01:14:27,939
Don't worry about me.

1145
01:14:27,939 --> 01:14:31,109
Anna! Oh, you had us worried sick...My Lady.

1146
01:14:31,109 --> 01:14:34,489
Get her warm and find Prince Hans, immediately.

1147
01:14:34,489 --> 01:14:36,529
We will. Thank you.

1148
01:14:36,529 --> 01:14:38,489
Make sure she's safe!

1149
01:14:56,629 --> 01:14:58,629
I'm going back out to look for Princess Anna.

1150
01:14:58,679 --> 01:15:00,679
You cannot risk going out there again.

1151
01:15:00,679 --> 01:15:01,799
If anything happens to her...

1152
01:15:01,799 --> 01:15:03,719
If anything happens to the Princess,

1153
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:05,679
you are all Arendelle has left.

1154
01:15:08,599 --> 01:15:10,729
He's in here. Prince Hans.

1155
01:15:10,729 --> 01:15:13,229
Anna. You're so cold.

1156
01:15:13,229 --> 01:15:14,519
Hans, you have to kiss me...What?

1157
01:15:14,519 --> 01:15:16,229
Now. Now.

1158
01:15:16,229 --> 01:15:18,439
We'll give you two some privacy.

1159
01:15:18,769 --> 01:15:20,479
What happened out there?

1160
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:22,239
Elsa struck me with her powers.

1161
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,529
You said she'd never hurt you.

1162
01:15:23,529 --> 01:15:24,819
I was wrong.

1163
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:26,819
Anna?

1164
01:15:28,869 --> 01:15:33,239
She froze my heart and only an act of true love can save me.

1165
01:15:34,909 --> 01:15:36,699
A true love's kiss.

1166
01:15:46,759 --> 01:15:48,629
Oh, Anna...

1167
01:15:49,459 --> 01:15:52,419
If only there was someone out there who loved you.

1168
01:15:52,679 --> 01:15:54,139
What?

1169
01:15:56,889 --> 01:15:59,389
You said you did.

1170
01:16:00,519 --> 01:16:03,019
As thirteenth in line in my own

1171
01:16:03,019 --> 01:16:05,559
...kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I knew...

1172
01:16:05,559 --> 01:16:08,269
I'd have to marry into the throne somewhere...

1173
01:16:08,269 --> 01:16:10,269
What are you talking about?

1174
01:16:10,269 --> 01:16:12,519
As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course.

1175
01:16:12,519 --> 01:16:14,859
But no one was getting anywhere with her.

1176
01:16:14,859 --> 01:16:16,279
But you...Hans?

1177
01:16:16,279 --> 01:16:17,819
You were so desperate for love,

1178
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:20,409
You were willing to marry me, just like that.

1179
01:16:21,869 --> 01:16:23,829
I figured, after we married, I'd have

1180
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:25,829
to stage a little accident for Elsa.

1181
01:16:25,829 --> 01:16:28,369
Hans. No, stop.

1182
01:16:28,369 --> 01:16:30,249
But then she doomed herself, and you were

1183
01:16:30,249 --> 01:16:32,209
...dumb enough to go after her.

1184
01:16:32,209 --> 01:16:33,459
Please.

1185
01:16:33,459 --> 01:16:38,209
All that's left now is to kill Elsa and bring back summer.

1186
01:16:38,209 --> 01:16:40,879
You're no match for Elsa.

1187
01:16:40,879 --> 01:16:43,509
No, you're no match for Elsa.

1188
01:16:43,509 --> 01:16:46,549
I, on the other hand, am the hero who is

1189
01:16:46,549 --> 01:16:49,509
going to save Arendelle from destruction.

1190
01:16:50,389 --> 01:16:52,679
You won't get away with this.

1191
01:16:54,219 --> 01:16:56,389
Oh, I already have.

1192
01:17:01,349 --> 01:17:04,149
Please, somebody help.

1193
01:17:07,069 --> 01:17:09,699
Please, please!

1194
01:17:12,029 --> 01:17:13,699
It's getting colder by the minute.

1195
01:17:13,699 --> 01:17:16,619
If we don't do something soon, We'll all freeze to death.

1196
01:17:17,739 --> 01:17:21,789
Prince Hans...Princess Anna is...

1197
01:17:22,499 --> 01:17:23,909
Dead. What...?

1198
01:17:24,289 --> 01:17:26,999
What happened to her?

1199
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:34,129
She was killed by Queen Elsa.

1200
01:17:35,469 --> 01:17:37,379
Her own sister.

1201
01:17:37,379 --> 01:17:40,259
At least we got to say our marriage vows...

1202
01:17:42,009 --> 01:17:44,179
before she died in my arms.

1203
01:17:45,969 --> 01:17:47,969
There can be no doubt now,

1204
01:17:47,969 --> 01:17:51,649
Queen Elsa is a monster and we are all in grave danger.

1205
01:17:51,649 --> 01:17:55,729
Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to you.

1206
01:17:56,939 --> 01:17:58,689
With a heavy heart,

1207
01:17:58,689 --> 01:18:03,359
I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason

1208
01:18:03,739 --> 01:18:06,529
and sentence her to death.

1209
01:18:18,829 --> 01:18:19,829
Hurry Up!

1210
01:18:19,829 --> 01:18:23,589
She's dangerous. Move quickly and be careful.

1211
01:18:23,589 --> 01:18:25,589
The Door not open!

1212
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:57,609
What is it, buddy? Hey, watch it.

1213
01:18:57,609 --> 01:18:59,199
What's wrong with you?

1214
01:19:02,119 --> 01:19:04,699
I don't understand you when you talk like that.

1215
01:19:05,489 --> 01:19:08,119
Ah! Stop it! Put me down!

1216
01:19:09,459 --> 01:19:11,869
No, Sven! We're not going back!

1217
01:19:11,869 --> 01:19:14,249
She's with her true love.

1218
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:22,219
What the...

1219
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,549
Anna!

1220
01:19:51,819 --> 01:19:53,569
Help.

1221
01:19:58,289 --> 01:20:00,909
Anna. Oh no.

1222
01:20:13,709 --> 01:20:18,049
Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there.

1223
01:20:19,509 --> 01:20:22,549
So this is heat... I love it.

1224
01:20:22,549 --> 01:20:25,509
Ooh! But don't touch it!

1225
01:20:33,399 --> 01:20:37,109
So, where's Hans? What happened to your kiss?

1226
01:20:37,109 --> 01:20:40,739
I was wrong about him. It wasn't true love.

1227
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:42,739
Huh. But we ran all the way here?

1228
01:20:42,739 --> 01:20:46,319
Please Olaf, you can't stay here, you'll melt.

1229
01:20:46,319 --> 01:20:47,819
I am not leaving here until we find

1230
01:20:47,819 --> 01:20:50,279
...some other act of true love to save you.

1231
01:20:50,409 --> 01:20:52,579
Do you happen to have any ideas?

1232
01:20:52,579 --> 01:20:55,579
I don't even know what love is.

1233
01:20:55,579 --> 01:20:58,499
That's okay, I do...Love is...

1234
01:20:59,079 --> 01:21:02,089
putting someone else's needs before yours, like, you know,

1235
01:21:02,089 --> 01:21:04,129
how Kristoff brought you back here

1236
01:21:04,129 --> 01:21:06,129
to Hans and left you forever.

1237
01:21:09,129 --> 01:21:11,839
Kristoff loves me?

1238
01:21:12,929 --> 01:21:17,049
Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you?

1239
01:21:17,099 --> 01:21:18,139
Olaf, you're melting.

1240
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:21,139
Some people are worth melting for.

1241
01:21:26,519 --> 01:21:28,979
Just maybe not right this second.

1242
01:21:30,689 --> 01:21:32,899
Don't worry, I've got it!

1243
01:21:34,819 --> 01:21:36,319
We're going to get through...

1244
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:39,109
Oh, wait. Hang on. I'm getting something.

1245
01:21:40,279 --> 01:21:44,329
It's Kristoff and Sven! They're coming back this way.

1246
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:46,199
They-they are?

1247
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:49,659
Wow, he's really moving fast. Huh...I guess I was wrong.

1248
01:21:49,659 --> 01:21:51,159
I guess Kristoff doesn't love

1249
01:21:51,159 --> 01:21:52,619
...you enough to leave you behind.

1250
01:21:52,869 --> 01:21:54,919
Help me up, Olaf. Please.

1251
01:21:54,919 --> 01:21:56,459
No, no, no, no, no. You need to

1252
01:21:56,459 --> 01:21:58,049
stay by the fire and keep warm.

1253
01:21:58,049 --> 01:22:00,959
I need to get to Kristoff. Why?

1254
01:22:01,339 --> 01:22:03,969
Oh, oh, oh, I know why.

1255
01:22:03,969 --> 01:22:06,299
There's your act of true love right there,

1256
01:22:06,299 --> 01:22:08,759
Riding across the fjords like a Valiant,

1257
01:22:08,759 --> 01:22:11,259
pungent reindeer King! Come on!

1258
01:22:14,019 --> 01:22:15,519
Look out!

1259
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:26,439
Back this way!

1260
01:22:27,319 --> 01:22:28,819
We're trapped.

1261
01:22:50,669 --> 01:22:52,589
Slide, Anna.

1262
01:23:01,219 --> 01:23:02,849
We made it!

1263
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,719
Go, Go, Go, Go...

1264
01:23:17,819 --> 01:23:20,069
Come on, buddy, faster.

1265
01:23:21,819 --> 01:23:23,909
Kristoff!

1266
01:23:32,869 --> 01:23:34,789
Kristoff!

1267
01:24:29,919 --> 01:24:32,039
Sven!

1268
01:24:41,419 --> 01:24:43,259
Good boy.

1269
01:24:54,269 --> 01:24:55,849
Kristoff.

1270
01:24:59,309 --> 01:25:00,939
Anna!

1271
01:25:03,609 --> 01:25:05,149
Elsa.

1272
01:25:05,319 --> 01:25:07,899
You can't run from this!

1273
01:25:09,449 --> 01:25:13,159
Just take care of my sister...Your sister?

1274
01:25:13,159 --> 01:25:15,739
She returned from the mountain weak and cold.

1275
01:25:15,779 --> 01:25:18,369
She said you froze her heart.

1276
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:22,329
I tried to save her, but it was too late.

1277
01:25:22,829 --> 01:25:26,209
Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white...

1278
01:25:26,829 --> 01:25:30,629
Your sister is dead... because of you.

1279
01:25:30,629 --> 01:25:31,629
No!

1280
01:25:54,559 --> 01:25:55,979
Kristoff?

1281
01:25:57,899 --> 01:25:59,649
Anna!

1282
01:26:10,989 --> 01:26:12,579
Elsa?

1283
01:26:20,289 --> 01:26:22,129
No!

1284
01:26:34,139 --> 01:26:35,849
Anna!

1285
01:26:36,969 --> 01:26:42,229
Oh, Anna... no... no, please no.

1286
01:26:47,519 --> 01:26:49,059
Anna.

1287
01:26:51,029 --> 01:26:52,649
Anna?

1288
01:27:33,229 --> 01:27:35,189
Anna?

1289
01:27:37,269 --> 01:27:39,479
Oh, Elsa.

1290
01:27:39,479 --> 01:27:41,689
You sacrificed yourself for me?

1291
01:27:42,979 --> 01:27:44,649
I love you.

1292
01:27:45,739 --> 01:27:49,949
An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart.

1293
01:27:50,909 --> 01:27:53,069
Love... will thaw...

1294
01:27:53,859 --> 01:27:56,529
Love... Of course.

1295
01:27:56,529 --> 01:27:59,579
Elsa? Love.

1296
01:28:46,199 --> 01:28:47,989
I knew you could do it.

1297
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:51,829
Hands down, this is the best day of my life...

1298
01:28:51,829 --> 01:28:54,409
and quite possibly the last.

1299
01:28:54,409 --> 01:28:56,919
Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy.

1300
01:29:00,039 --> 01:29:02,749
Hey, my own personal flurry.

1301
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:15,969
Anna? But she froze your heart.

1302
01:29:15,969 --> 01:29:19,429
The only frozen heart around here is yours.

1303
01:29:43,329 --> 01:29:45,999
I will return this scoundrel to his country.

1304
01:29:45,999 --> 01:29:47,959
We shall see what his twelve big

1305
01:29:47,959 --> 01:29:49,909
brothers think of his behavior.

1306
01:29:49,909 --> 01:29:51,579
Arendelle thanks you, my Lord.

1307
01:29:51,579 --> 01:29:53,289
This is unacceptable.

1308
01:29:53,289 --> 01:29:55,499
I am innocent. I'm a victim of fear.

1309
01:29:55,499 --> 01:29:58,419
I've been traumatized. Ow! My neck hurts.

1310
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:01,629
Is there a doctor I could... No?

1311
01:30:01,629 --> 01:30:04,379
I demand to see the Queen!

1312
01:30:04,379 --> 01:30:07,049
I have a message from the Queen.

1313
01:30:07,049 --> 01:30:09,559
Arendelle will henceforth and forever

1314
01:30:09,559 --> 01:30:11,389
...no longer do business of any sort

1315
01:30:11,389 --> 01:30:13,139
with Weaseltown.

1316
01:30:13,139 --> 01:30:15,809
Weselton. It's Weselton!

1317
01:30:15,809 --> 01:30:19,559
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on! Ow, Okay, Okay...

1318
01:30:19,559 --> 01:30:21,979
Pole...Oops. So Sorry.

1319
01:30:21,979 --> 01:30:24,319
Okay. Okay. Here we are.

1320
01:30:27,359 --> 01:30:29,779
I owe you a sled.

1321
01:30:32,319 --> 01:30:33,909
Are you serious?

1322
01:30:33,909 --> 01:30:35,529
Yes. And it's the latest model.

1323
01:30:36,079 --> 01:30:37,619
No. I can't accept this...

1324
01:30:37,619 --> 01:30:40,659
You have to. No returns. No exchanges. Queen's orders.

1325
01:30:40,709 --> 01:30:41,959
She's named you the official.

1326
01:30:41,959 --> 01:30:44,629
Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.

1327
01:30:44,789 --> 01:30:46,669
What? That's not a thing...Sure it is.

1328
01:30:46,669 --> 01:30:50,129
And it even has a cup holder...Do you like it?

1329
01:30:50,129 --> 01:30:52,629
Like it? I love it...

1330
01:30:53,169 --> 01:30:55,169
I could kiss you!

1331
01:30:56,049 --> 01:30:58,089
I could. I mean I'd like to. I'd...

1332
01:30:58,089 --> 01:31:00,179
may I? We me... I mean, may we?

1333
01:31:00,179 --> 01:31:01,969
Wait, what?

1334
01:31:02,309 --> 01:31:04,059
We may.

1335
01:31:07,479 --> 01:31:09,189
Summer!

1336
01:31:12,979 --> 01:31:14,899
Hello.

1337
01:31:31,409 --> 01:31:33,499
Are you ready?

1338
01:31:57,059 --> 01:31:58,679
I like the open gates.

1339
01:31:58,809 --> 01:32:01,059
We are never closing them again.

1340
01:32:03,519 --> 01:32:04,979
What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,

1341
01:32:04,979 --> 01:32:06,479
but you know I don't ska...

1342
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:08,439
Come on, you can do it!

1343
01:32:09,069 --> 01:32:09,649
Hey, girls!

1344
01:32:12,069 --> 01:32:13,569
Hey, Guys
