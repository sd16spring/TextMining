1
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:33,355
- Wow.
- Mmm.

2
00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:37,320
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,400
-Wow.
-Yes, Marlin.

4
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,447
No, I see it.
lt's beautiful.

5
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:43,910
So, Coral, when you said
you wanted an ocean view...

6
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:47,946
you didn't think you'd get
the whole ocean, did you?

7
00:00:47,984 --> 00:00:52,588
[Sighs] Oh, yeah.
A fish can breathe out here.

8
00:00:52,624 --> 00:00:54,479
Did your man deliver,
or did he deliver?

9
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,716
- My man delivered.
- And it wasn't so easy.

10
00:00:56,753 --> 00:00:59,916
Because a lot of other clownfish
had their eyes on this place.

11
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:02,286
You better believe they did--
every single one of them.

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,262
Mm-hmm. You did good.

13
00:01:04,304 --> 00:01:06,824
And the neighborhood
is awesome.

14
00:01:16,432 --> 00:01:18,025
So, you do like it, don't you?

15
00:01:18,064 --> 00:01:21,381
No, no. I do, I do.
I really do like it.

16
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:25,198
But, Marlin, I know that
the drop off is desirable...

17
00:01:24,272 --> 00:01:26,443
with the great schools
and the amazing view...

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,176
but do we really need
so much space?

19
00:01:28,176 --> 00:01:28,459
but do we really need
so much space?

20
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:31,179
Coral, honey, these are our kids
we're talking about.

21
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,289
They deserve the best.
Look, look, look.

22
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:35,467
They'lI wake up,
poke their little heads out...

23
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:36,336
and they see a whale!
Right by their bedroom window.

24
00:01:36,336 --> 00:01:38,441
and they see a whale!
Right by their bedroom window.

25
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,684
Shh. You'lI wake the kids.

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,443
Oh, right, right.

27
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:50,603
Aw, look. They're dreaming.

28
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,712
We stilI have to name them.

29
00:01:52,752 --> 00:01:54,442
You want to name
alI of them right now?

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,611
AlI right, we'lI name
this half Marlin Junior...

31
00:01:57,647 --> 00:01:59,687
and this half CoraI Junior.

32
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:02,183
- OK, we're done.
- I like Nemo.

33
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:04,875
Nemo. We'lI name one Nemo...

34
00:02:04,912 --> 00:02:07,367
but l'd like most of them
to be Marlin Junior.

35
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:08,717
Just think,
in a couple of days...

36
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:12,101
- We're going to be parents.
- Yeah.

37
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:13,704
What if they don't like me?

38
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:15,205
- Marlin.
- No, really.

39
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:20,004
There's over 400 eggs.
Odds are, one wilI like you.

40
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:24,169
What?

41
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:27,688
-You remember how we met?
-I try not to.

42
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:29,134
Well, I remember.
''Excuse me, miss...

43
00:02:29,168 --> 00:02:31,535
''can you check and see
if I have a hook in my lip?''

44
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,837
You got a little closer
because it was wiggling.

45
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:36,871
- Get away, get away!
- Here he is. Cutie's here.

46
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:40,678
Where did everybody go?

47
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:55,495
Coral, get inside the house.

48
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,973
No, Coral, don't.
They'lI be fine.

49
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:55,495
Just get inside... You, right now.

50
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,948
No! Ow!

51
00:02:59,984 --> 00:03:01,806
Oh!

52
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,432
Ooh! Ooh!

53
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,881
Coral!

54
00:03:24,207 --> 00:03:26,094
Coral?

55
00:03:29,134 --> 00:03:30,411
Coral?

56
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:37,257
Coral?

57
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,876
Coral?

58
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,264
Coral?

59
00:04:01,263 --> 00:04:02,408
Coral?

60
00:04:06,223 --> 00:04:08,111
Oh!

61
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:11,819
There, there, there.

62
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:14,244
lt's OK. Daddy's here.

63
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,031
Daddy's got you.

64
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,101
I promise, I wilI never
let anything happen to you...

65
00:04:24,143 --> 00:04:25,833
Nemo.

66
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:03,150
First day of school!

67
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,834
Wake up, wake up!
First day of school.

68
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,259
I don't want to go to school--
five more minutes.

69
00:05:08,302 --> 00:05:09,513
Not you, Dad, me.

70
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,892
-OK. Huh?
-Get up, get up.

71
00:05:10,926 --> 00:05:13,512
lt's time for school,
time for school.

72
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,044
AlI right, l'm up.

73
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:16,680
Whoa!

74
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:18,376
- Nemo!
- First day of school!

75
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:20,487
- Nemo, don't move.
- Unh! Unh!

76
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:21,868
You'lI never get out of there yourself.

77
00:05:21,902 --> 00:05:23,975
l'lI do it. Unh! [Pop]

78
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:25,902
- You feeI a break?
- No.

79
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:27,592
Sometimes you can't tell
'cause fluid rushes to the area.

80
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,735
-Are you woozy?
-No.

81
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:31,945
-How many stripes do I have?
-l'm fine.

82
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:33,705
- Answer the stripe question.
- Three.

83
00:05:33,742 --> 00:05:35,149
No! See?
Something's wrong with you.

84
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:37,866
I have one, two, three--
That's alI I have?

85
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:40,684
You're OK.
How's the lucky fin?

86
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:43,401
-Lucky.
-Let's see.

87
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:47,202
Are you sure you want to go
to schooI this year?

88
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:49,068
There's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.

89
00:05:49,102 --> 00:05:50,890
Come on, Dad, it's time for school.

90
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:53,479
-Forgot to brush.
-Ohh.

91
00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:55,427
Do you want this anemone
to sting you?

92
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,771
-Yes.
-Brush.

93
00:05:57,806 --> 00:05:59,399
-OK, l'm done.
-You missed a spot.

94
00:05:59,438 --> 00:05:59,726
- Where?
- There.

95
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,319
- Where?
- There.

96
00:06:01,358 --> 00:06:04,205
Ha ha! Right there.
And here and here.

97
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:12,814
AlI right, we're excited.

98
00:06:12,814 --> 00:06:13,926
AlI right, we're excited.

99
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:15,656
The first day of school.
Here we go.

100
00:06:15,694 --> 00:06:17,581
We're ready to learn
to get some knowledge.

101
00:06:17,614 --> 00:06:19,915
What's the one thing we have
to remember about the ocean?

102
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,284
-lt's not safe.
-That's my boy.

103
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:24,489
First, we check to see
that the coast is clear.

104
00:06:24,525 --> 00:06:26,827
We go out...and back in.

105
00:06:26,862 --> 00:06:29,065
And then we go out... and back in.

106
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:32,004
And then one more time... out and back in.

107
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:33,802
And sometimes, if you want
to do it four times--

108
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:36,107
- Dad...
- AlI right, come on, boy.

109
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:41,669
Maybe while l'm at school,
l'lI see a shark.

110
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:44,262
- I highly doubt that.
- Have you ever met a shark?

111
00:06:44,302 --> 00:06:45,895
No, and I don't plan to.

112
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:49,000
- How old are sea turtles?
- I don't know.

113
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:50,663
Sandy Plankton
from next door...

114
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,485
he says that sea turtles live
to be about 100 years old.

115
00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:55,820
he says that sea turtles live
to be about 100 years old.

116
00:06:55,853 --> 00:06:58,024
lf I ever meet a sea turtle,
l'lI ask him.

117
00:06:58,062 --> 00:06:59,917
After l'm done
talking to the shark, OK?

118
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:01,454
Whoa! Hold on.
Wait to cross.

119
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,396
Whoa! Hold on.
Wait to cross.

120
00:07:03,437 --> 00:07:05,542
Hold my fin.

121
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:06,858
Dad, you're not
going to freak out...

122
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,803
like you did at
the petting zoo, are you?

123
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,496
That snaiI was about to charge.

124
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:13,868
Hmm. I wonder where
we're supposed to go.

125
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,330
ALL: Bye, Mom!

126
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:17,381
l'lI pick you up after school.

127
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:19,046
Ha ha!

128
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:22,020
Come on, you guys, stop it!
Give it back!

129
00:07:22,062 --> 00:07:24,931
Come on, we'lI try over there.

130
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:28,196
Excuse me, is this where
we meet his teacher?

131
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:30,658
Well, look who's out
of the anemone.

132
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:31,373
Yes. Shocking, I know.

133
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:31,842
Yes. Shocking, I know.

134
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,576
-Marty, right?
-Marlin.

135
00:07:33,613 --> 00:07:34,726
- Bob.
- Ted.

136
00:07:34,765 --> 00:07:36,674
Bill.
Hey, you're a clownfish.

137
00:07:36,718 --> 00:07:39,173
You're funny, right?
TelI us a joke.

138
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:40,457
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

139
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,275
Well, actually,
that's a common misconception.

140
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:45,731
Clownfish are no funnier
than any other fish.

141
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:47,682
- Come on, clownie.
- Do something funny.

142
00:07:47,725 --> 00:07:50,092
AlI right, I know one joke.

143
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:54,020
There's a mollusk, see?
And he walks up to a sea--

144
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:56,035
He doesn't walk up,
he swims up.

145
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:57,865
Actually, the mollusk isn't moving.

146
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:01,316
He's in one place,
and then the sea cucumber...

147
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:02,764
Well, they... l'm mixed up.

148
00:08:02,797 --> 00:08:05,415
There was a mollusk
and a sea cucumber.

149
00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:06,413
None of them were walking,
so forget that l--

150
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:06,947
None of them were walking,
so forget that l--

151
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:10,087
Sheldon! Get out of
Mr. Johannsen's yard now!

152
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,394
-Whoa!
-AlI right, you kids!

153
00:08:13,388 --> 00:08:16,323
Ooh, where'd you go?

154
00:08:15,405 --> 00:08:17,477
Dad, can I go play, too?
Can l?

155
00:08:17,517 --> 00:08:20,386
I would feeI better if
you'd play on the sponge beds.

156
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,627
That's where I would play.

157
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:30,571
- What's wrong with his fin?
- He looks funny.

158
00:08:31,564 --> 00:08:33,833
Ow! Hey, what'd I do?

159
00:08:32,908 --> 00:08:34,796
Be nice.
lt's his first time at school.

160
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:37,414
He was born with it.
We calI it his lucky fin.

161
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,622
- Dad...
- See this tentacle?

162
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:41,701
lt's actually shorter
than alI my other tentacles...

163
00:08:41,741 --> 00:08:43,781
but you can't really tell.

164
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,155
Especially when I twirI them like this.

165
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:48,164
l'm H-2-O intolerant.

166
00:08:48,205 --> 00:08:50,092
-Ah-choo!
-l'm obnoxious.

167
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,619
� Oh �

168
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,377
Let's name the zones, the zones, the zones

169
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:57,446
Let's name the zones of the open sea

170
00:08:57,485 --> 00:08:58,630
Mr. Ray!

171
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:01,451
- Come on, Nemo.
- You better stay with me.

172
00:09:02,444 --> 00:09:04,232
Mesopelagic, bathyal,
abyssalpelagic

173
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,604
AlI the rest are too deep
for you and me to see

174
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:09,833
Huh. I wonder where
my class has gone?

175
00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:11,527
ALL: We're under here!

176
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:13,353
Oh, there you are.

177
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:14,882
Climb aboard, explorers.

178
00:09:15,393 --> 00:09:16,160
Oh, knowledge exploring

179
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:18,078
ls, oh, so lyrical

180
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,133
When you think thoughts
that are empirical

181
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:21,157
Dad, you can go now.

182
00:09:21,197 --> 00:09:24,164
- Hello. Who is this?
- l'm Nemo.

183
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:27,717
Nemo, alI new explorers
must answer a science question.

184
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:30,440
- OK.
- You live in what kind of home?

185
00:09:30,476 --> 00:09:32,102
An anemon-none.

186
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,050
A nemenem-menome.

187
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:36,995
OK, don't hurt yourself.
Welcome aboard, explorers.

188
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:38,891
Just so you know,
he's got a little fin.

189
00:09:38,924 --> 00:09:40,517
I find if he's having
trouble swimming...

190
00:09:40,557 --> 00:09:42,444
I let him take a break, 10, 15 minutes.

191
00:09:42,477 --> 00:09:44,811
Dad, it's time for you to go now.

192
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:46,819
Don't worry. We're gonna
stay together as a group.

193
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,162
OK, class,
opticaI orbits up front.

194
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:52,066
And remember, we keep
our supraesophogeaI ganglion...

195
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:54,443
to ourselves.
That means you, Jimmy.

196
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:54,572
Aw, man!

197
00:09:54,572 --> 00:09:56,361
JlMMY: Aw, man!

198
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,338
Bye, Nemo!

199
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,722
Bye, Dad!

200
00:09:59,757 --> 00:10:01,349
Bye, son!

201
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:05,191
Be safe.

202
00:10:05,228 --> 00:10:07,683
You're doing pretty well
for a first-timer.

203
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:09,961
You can't hold on to them
forever, can you?

204
00:10:09,996 --> 00:10:12,135
I had a tough time with
my oldest out at the drop off.

205
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:14,343
They got to grow up--
The drop off?

206
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,129
They're going to the drop off?
What are you, insane?

207
00:10:17,164 --> 00:10:20,328
Why don't we fry them up now
and serve them with chips?

208
00:10:20,364 --> 00:10:21,575
Hey, Marty, calm down.

209
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:24,742
Don't telI me
to be calm, pony boy.

210
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,023
Pony boy?

211
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,809
For a clownfish,
he really isn't that funny.

212
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:30,186
Pity.

213
00:10:32,044 --> 00:10:34,499
Let's name the species,
the species, the species

214
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,784
Let's name the species
that live in the sea

215
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,933
Whoa.

216
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:38,695
There's

217
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:40,706
Porifera, coelenterata,
hydrozoa, scyphozoa

218
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:42,722
Anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas, three

219
00:10:42,763 --> 00:10:45,316
Gastropoda, arthropoda,
echinoderma

220
00:10:45,356 --> 00:10:46,600
� And some fish
like you and me �

221
00:10:46,636 --> 00:10:47,912
Come on, sing with me.

222
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:50,184
Oh

223
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,648
Just the girls this time.

224
00:10:56,684 --> 00:10:58,571
Oh, seaweed is cool

225
00:10:58,604 --> 00:10:59,814
Seaweed is fun

226
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:01,258
lt makes its food

227
00:11:04,428 --> 00:11:06,370
OK, the drop off.

228
00:11:06,411 --> 00:11:08,583
AlI right, kids,
feeI free to explore...

229
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,732
but stay close.

230
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:11,877
Stromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather.

231
00:11:13,164 --> 00:11:15,782
An entire ecosystem contained
in one infinitesimaI speck.

232
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:17,412
There are as many protein pairs
contained in this...

233
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:19,786
Come on, let's go.

234
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,129
Come on, sing with me!

235
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:23,334
There's porifera, coelenterata

236
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:24,779
Hydrozoa, scyphozoa

237
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:26,315
Anthozoa, ctenophora,
bryozoas, three

238
00:11:26,315 --> 00:11:29,250
Hey, guys, wait up!

239
00:11:29,292 --> 00:11:31,463
Whoa.

240
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:36,002
Cool.

241
00:11:37,612 --> 00:11:39,172
Saved your life!

242
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:41,448
Aw, you guys made me ink.

243
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:44,202
What's that?

244
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,481
TAD: I know what that is.
Sandy Plankton saw one.

245
00:11:48,523 --> 00:11:51,491
He said it was called a butt.

246
00:11:51,531 --> 00:11:52,905
- Whoa.
- Wow.

247
00:11:53,898 --> 00:11:56,102
That's a pretty big butt.

248
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:59,621
Oh, look at me.
l'm going to touch the butt.

249
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:02,026
- Ah-choo! Whoa!
- Ha ha ha!

250
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:04,743
Oh, yeah?
Let's see you get closer.

251
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:06,339
OK.

252
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:08,768
Beat that.

253
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,232
Come on, Nemo.
How far can you go?

254
00:12:11,276 --> 00:12:13,642
My dad says it's not safe.

255
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:16,490
- Nemo! No!
- Dad?

256
00:12:16,523 --> 00:12:17,898
You were about
to swim into open water.

257
00:12:17,931 --> 00:12:19,109
No, I wasn't--

258
00:12:19,147 --> 00:12:20,903
Good thing I was here.
lf I hadn't shown up--

259
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:23,110
-He wasn't going to go.
-He was too afraid.

260
00:12:23,147 --> 00:12:24,391
No, I wasn't.

261
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:25,801
This does not
concern you, kids...

262
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:28,104
and you're lucky
I don't telI your parents.

263
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:29,383
You know you can't swim well.

264
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:31,273
I can swim fine, Dad, OK?

265
00:12:31,307 --> 00:12:34,089
No, it's not OK.
You shouldn't be near here.

266
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:36,424
OK, I was right. You'lI start
schooI in a year or two.

267
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:39,077
No, Dad! Just because
you're scared of the ocean--

268
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:39,563
Clearly, you're not ready...

269
00:12:39,563 --> 00:12:40,229
Clearly, you're not ready...

270
00:12:40,267 --> 00:12:41,380
and you're not coming back
untiI you are.

271
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:42,629
You think
you can do these things...

272
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,489
but you just can't, Nemo!

273
00:12:45,771 --> 00:12:47,298
I hate you.

274
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:50,980
There's

275
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:52,775
Nothing to see.
Gather. Over there.

276
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:54,022
Excuse me.
ls there anything I can do?

277
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:56,034
I am a scientist, sir.
ls there any problem?

278
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,082
l'm sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt things.

279
00:12:58,122 --> 00:13:00,839
He isn't a good swimmer,
and it's a little too soon...

280
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,533
for him to be out here
unsupervised.

281
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,261
I can assure you,
he's quite safe with me.

282
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:07,146
MARLlN: l'm sure he is,
but you have a large class...

283
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:09,895
and he can get lost from sight
if you're not looking.

284
00:13:09,931 --> 00:13:10,123
l'm not saying
you're not looking.

285
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,030
l'm not saying
you're not looking.

286
00:13:11,114 --> 00:13:13,929
Oh, my gosh!
Nemo's swimming out to sea!

287
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:16,869
Nemo!

288
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:19,845
What do you think you're doing?

289
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,566
You'lI get stuck out there...

290
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:25,952
and l'lI have to get you
before another fish does.

291
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:27,814
Get back here!

292
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:30,720
I said get back here now!

293
00:13:30,762 --> 00:13:35,399
Stop! You take
one more move, mister...

294
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:37,223
Don't you dare!

295
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:39,233
lf you put one fin
on that boat...

296
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:40,703
Are you listening to me?

297
00:13:40,747 --> 00:13:44,227
Don't touch the bo--Nemo!

298
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:45,827
He touched the butt.

299
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,484
You paddle your little tail
right back here, Nemo.

300
00:13:48,522 --> 00:13:49,635
That's right.

301
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:51,300
You are in big trouble, young man.

302
00:13:51,338 --> 00:13:53,062
Do you hear me? Big...

303
00:13:54,795 --> 00:13:56,682
-Big...
-Aah!

304
00:13:57,994 --> 00:13:59,750
Aah!

305
00:13:59,786 --> 00:14:01,761
Daddy! Help me!

306
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:04,650
l'm coming, Nemo!

307
00:14:05,898 --> 00:14:07,753
- Aah!
- Get under me, kids!

308
00:14:07,787 --> 00:14:09,128
Aah! Oh! No!

309
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:10,787
Dad!

310
00:14:10,826 --> 00:14:13,127
Daddy!

311
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:18,983
Oh! Nemo!

312
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:23,232
Unh. Nemo!

313
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:26,754
Nemo, no! Nemo!

314
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:29,641
Nemo! Nemo! No!

315
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:33,855
No!

316
00:14:33,898 --> 00:14:36,680
Aah!

317
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:40,864
Uhh

318
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:43,871
Nemo! Nemo!

319
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:54,916
Whoa! Hold on.

320
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:08,355
Oh, no.

321
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:10,881
No. No, it's gone.
lt's gone.

322
00:15:10,922 --> 00:15:12,166
No, no,
it can't be gone.

323
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,438
No, no! Nemo!

324
00:15:14,474 --> 00:15:16,009
Nemo! Nemo!

325
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:17,536
Nemo! Nemo!

326
00:15:17,577 --> 00:15:19,716
No!

327
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,305
Nemo! Nemo!

328
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:25,029
No! No, please, no!

329
00:15:27,722 --> 00:15:28,867
No, no!

330
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,639
Has anybody seen a boat?

331
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,437
Please! A white boat!

332
00:15:34,474 --> 00:15:36,067
They took my son!

333
00:15:36,106 --> 00:15:38,505
My son! Help me, please.

334
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,328
- Look out!
- What?

335
00:15:40,361 --> 00:15:42,663
Ooh. Ohh.

336
00:15:42,697 --> 00:15:46,145
Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry.
I didn't see you.

337
00:15:46,185 --> 00:15:49,349
- Sir? Are you OK?
- He's gone, he's gone.

338
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:50,760
There, there.
lt's alI right.

339
00:15:50,794 --> 00:15:52,004
-He's gone.
-lt'lI be OK.

340
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,456
No, no. They took him away.
I have to find the boat.

341
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:57,472
A boat?
Hey, l've seen a boat.

342
00:15:57,513 --> 00:15:59,717
-You have?
-lt passed by not too long ago.

343
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:02,023
-A white one?
-Hi. l'm Dory.

344
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:03,202
Where? Which way?

345
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:05,314
Oh, oh, oh.
lt went this way.

346
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:06,698
lt went this way.
Follow me.

347
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,959
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you so much.

348
00:16:09,993 --> 00:16:11,073
No problem.

349
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:36,576
Hey...

350
00:16:36,617 --> 00:16:37,959
Wait!

351
00:16:43,817 --> 00:16:45,824
- WilI you quit it?
- What?

352
00:16:45,865 --> 00:16:48,516
l'm trying to swim here.
Ocean isn't big enough for you?

353
00:16:48,553 --> 00:16:48,873
You got a problem, buddy?
Huh? Huh?

354
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:50,661
You got a problem, buddy?
Huh? Huh?

355
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:53,282
Do you? Do you?
You want a piece of me?

356
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:55,109
Ooh, l'm scared now. What?

357
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:57,632
-Wait a minute.
-Stop following me, OK?

358
00:16:57,673 --> 00:17:00,672
What? You're showing me
where the boat went.

359
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:02,249
A boat?
Hey, l've seen a boat.

360
00:17:02,473 --> 00:17:05,539
lt passed by not too long ago.
lt went this way.

361
00:17:05,577 --> 00:17:06,919
lt went this way.
Follow me.

362
00:17:06,953 --> 00:17:08,993
Wait a minute.
What is going on?

363
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:11,236
You already told me
which way the boat was going.

364
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:14,339
I did? Oh, no.

365
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:16,581
lf this is some kind of
practicaI joke, it's not funny.

366
00:17:16,616 --> 00:17:18,820
And I know funny.
l'm a clownfish.

367
00:17:19,816 --> 00:17:23,078
No, it's not. I know it's not.
l'm so sorry.

368
00:17:22,153 --> 00:17:25,000
See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.

369
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:28,710
Short-term memory loss.
I don't believe this.

370
00:17:28,744 --> 00:17:30,533
No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly.

371
00:17:30,569 --> 00:17:34,365
lt runs in my family. At least, I think it does.

372
00:17:34,408 --> 00:17:38,271
Um, hmm. Where are they?

373
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:44,200
Can I help you?

374
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,753
Something's wrong with you... really.

375
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:48,581
You're wasting my time.

376
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:50,591
I have to find my son.

377
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:55,198
Hello.

378
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,150
- Ohh.
- Well, hi!

379
00:17:57,192 --> 00:18:00,094
Name's Bruce.

380
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:01,827
lt's alI right. I understand.

381
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:05,443
Why trust a shark, right?

382
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:15,200
So, what's a couple of bites like you... doing out so late, eh?

383
00:18:16,873 --> 00:18:18,815
We're not doing anything.
We're not even out.

384
00:18:18,856 --> 00:18:20,995
Great! Then how'd you morsels...

385
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:24,163
like to come to a little
get-together l'm having?

386
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:25,346
You mean, like a party?

387
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:29,279
Yeah, right. A party. What do you say?

388
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,392
I love parties. That sounds like fun.

389
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:33,734
Parties are fun,
and it's tempting, but...

390
00:18:33,768 --> 00:18:37,510
Oh, come on, I insist.

391
00:18:37,545 --> 00:18:40,611
OK.
That's alI that matters.

392
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:45,217
Hey, look, balloons.
lt is a party.

393
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:47,493
Ha ha ha ha!
Mind your distance, though.

394
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:50,081
Those balloons can be a bit dodgy.

395
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,324
You wouldn't want
one of them to pop.

396
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,374
Oh.

397
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:04,737
Ohh.

398
00:19:05,704 --> 00:19:08,224
Anchor! Chum!

399
00:19:08,264 --> 00:19:10,948
There you are, Bruce.
Finally.

400
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,537
- We got company.
- lt's about time, mate.

401
00:19:13,575 --> 00:19:14,408
We've already gone through the snacks...

402
00:19:14,408 --> 00:19:14,975
We've already gone through the snacks...

403
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:16,510
and l'm stilI starving.

404
00:19:16,552 --> 00:19:18,657
We almost had a feeding frenzy.

405
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:20,354
Come on, let's get this over with.

406
00:19:21,544 --> 00:19:23,071
Right, then.

407
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:25,316
The meeting has officially
come to order.

408
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:26,780
Let us alI say the pledge.

409
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:31,133
I am a nice shark,
not a mindless eating machine.

410
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:33,696
lf I am to change this image...

411
00:19:33,735 --> 00:19:36,070
I must first change myself.

412
00:19:36,104 --> 00:19:38,722
Fish are friends, not food.

413
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,036
Except stinkin' dolphins.

414
00:19:40,072 --> 00:19:42,974
Dolphins. Yeah.
They think they're so cute.

415
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,674
''Look at me.l'm a flippin' little dolphin.

416
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:46,304
''Let me flip for you. Ain't I something?''

417
00:19:46,344 --> 00:19:48,831
Right, then.
Today's meeting is Step 5...

418
00:19:48,872 --> 00:19:50,465
Bring a Fish Friend.

419
00:19:50,504 --> 00:19:51,933
Do you alI have your friends?

420
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:53,088
Got mine.

421
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:56,927
- Hey, there.
- How about you, Chum?

422
00:19:56,968 --> 00:20:01,310
Oh, l...seem to have misplaced my friend.

423
00:20:02,855 --> 00:20:04,164
That's alI right, Chum.

424
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,662
I had a feeling this would be a difficult step.

425
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,165
You can help yourself to one of my friends.

426
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:10,524
Thanks, mate.
A little chum for Chum, eh?

427
00:20:10,568 --> 00:20:12,161
l'lI start the testimonies.

428
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:14,338
Hello. My name is Bruce.

429
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,586
Hello, Bruce.

430
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:17,695
lt has been three weeks
since my last fish.

431
00:20:17,736 --> 00:20:21,031
On my honor, or may I be
chopped up and made into soup.

432
00:20:21,064 --> 00:20:23,714
- You're an inspiration!
- Amen.

433
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:26,278
Right, then. Who's next?

434
00:20:26,311 --> 00:20:27,555
Pick me, pick me.

435
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:29,380
Yes. The little
Sheila down the front.

436
00:20:29,415 --> 00:20:31,390
- Whoo!
- Come on up here.

437
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:34,116
Hi. l'm Dory.

438
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:36,453
- Hello, Dory.
- And, uh, well...

439
00:20:36,488 --> 00:20:39,521
I don't think
l've ever eaten a fish.

440
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,975
- That's incredible.
- Good on you, mate.

441
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:44,957
l'm glad. I got that off my chest.

442
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:46,276
AlI right, anyone else?

443
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,799
How about you, mate?
What's your problem?

444
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,978
Me? I don't have a problem.

445
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:52,324
Oh, OK.

446
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,886
- Denial.
- Aah!

447
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:55,683
Just start with your name.

448
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:58,305
OK. Uh, hello.

449
00:20:58,343 --> 00:21:01,310
My name is Marlin.l'm a clownfish.

450
00:21:01,351 --> 00:21:04,253
- A clownfish? Really?
- TelI us a joke.

451
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:05,953
I love jokes.

452
00:21:05,991 --> 00:21:08,861
I actually do know one
that's pretty good.

453
00:21:08,903 --> 00:21:10,845
There was this mollusk...

454
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:13,124
and he walks up to a sea cucumber.

455
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:14,915
Normally, they don't talk,
sea cucumbers...

456
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:16,838
but in a joke, everyone talks...

457
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:19,805
so the sea mollusk
says to the cucumber...

458
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,935
Daddy!

459
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:25,252
Nemo!

460
00:21:25,287 --> 00:21:28,189
Nemo! Ha ha! Nemo! I don't get it.

461
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,053
For a clownfish, he's not that funny.

462
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:31,843
No, no, no, no.
He's my son.

463
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:33,853
He was taken by these divers.

464
00:21:33,895 --> 00:21:36,480
Oh, my. You poor fish.

465
00:21:36,518 --> 00:21:38,406
Humans--think they own
everything.

466
00:21:38,438 --> 00:21:39,649
Probably American.

467
00:21:39,687 --> 00:21:40,647
Now, there is a father.... Looking for his little boy.

468
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:43,647
Now, there is a father.... Looking for his little boy.

469
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:46,076
What do these markings mean?

470
00:21:46,118 --> 00:21:48,355
I never knew my father!

471
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,692
- Group hug.
- We're alI mates here, mate.

472
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:51,904
I can't read human.

473
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,153
We got to find a fish
that can read this.

474
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,078
- Hey, look, sharks.
- No, no, no, Dory!

475
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,150
- Guys, guys.
- No, Dory.

476
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,467
That's mine. Give it to me.

477
00:21:58,502 --> 00:21:59,909
Gimme! Ow!

478
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,830
Oh, l'm sorry. Are you OK?

479
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:03,204
- Ow, ow, ow.
- l'm so sorry.

480
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,279
You really clocked me there.
Am I bleeding?

481
00:22:05,318 --> 00:22:07,140
- Ohh.
- Ow, ow, ow.

482
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:10,590
Dory, are you OK--Ohh.

483
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,399
Ohh, that's good.

484
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:14,017
Ohh, that's good.

485
00:22:14,054 --> 00:22:15,876
Intervention!

486
00:22:15,911 --> 00:22:18,398
- Just a bite.
- Hold it together, mate!

487
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:20,959
Remember, Bruce,
fish are friends, not food!

488
00:22:20,998 --> 00:22:23,014
- Food!
- Dory, look out!

489
00:22:23,014 --> 00:22:23,778
- Food!
- Dory, look out!

490
00:22:23,814 --> 00:22:27,229
- Aah!
- l'm having fish tonight!

491
00:22:27,271 --> 00:22:28,797
Remember the steps, mate!

492
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:31,260
Aah!

493
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:35,295
-Aah! Whoa!
-Aah!

494
00:22:34,374 --> 00:22:36,545
- Just one bite!
- Aah!

495
00:22:39,494 --> 00:22:43,106
G'day. Grr!

496
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:46,272
There's no way out!

497
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,041
There's got to be a way to escape!

498
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,438
Who is it?

499
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:51,747
Dory, help me
find a way out!

500
00:22:51,782 --> 00:22:54,204
Sorry. Come back later.
We're trying to escape.

501
00:22:55,398 --> 00:22:58,627
- There's got to be a way out!
- Here's something.

502
00:22:58,663 --> 00:23:01,281
''Es-cap-e.''. I wonder what that means.

503
00:23:01,318 --> 00:23:02,780
Funny. lt's spelled just like ''escape.''

504
00:23:02,822 --> 00:23:04,032
- Let's go.
- Aah!

505
00:23:04,071 --> 00:23:07,038
Here's Brucey!

506
00:23:07,078 --> 00:23:08,704
Wait a minute.
You can read?

507
00:23:08,742 --> 00:23:10,651
I can read?
That's right. I can read!

508
00:23:10,694 --> 00:23:12,734
Well, then, here.
Read this now.

509
00:23:12,774 --> 00:23:14,661
- Aah!
- Ohh!

510
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,345
He really doesn't mean it.
He never even knew his father.

511
00:23:17,382 --> 00:23:18,560
Don't falI off the wagon!

512
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:20,092
- Aah!
- Aah!

513
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,806
Oh, no, it's blocked!

514
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,114
No, Bruce, focus.

515
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,189
Sorry about Bruce, mate.

516
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,783
He's really a nice guy.

517
00:23:34,822 --> 00:23:36,000
I need to get that mask.

518
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:37,565
You want that mask? OK.

519
00:23:37,606 --> 00:23:40,257
No, no, no, no, no, no!

520
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,716
Quick, grab the mask!

521
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:49,155
Oh, no. Bruce?

522
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,751
What?

523
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:55,137
Swim away! Swim away!

524
00:23:55,174 --> 00:23:56,832
Aw, is the party over?

525
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:07,653
Nice.

526
00:24:10,621 --> 00:24:11,733
Dad?

527
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:15,606
Daddy?

528
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:18,902
Huh?

529
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:23,091
Aah! Uhh!

530
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:26,646
Uhh!

531
00:24:37,532 --> 00:24:39,387
- Barbara.
- Uh-huh?

532
00:24:39,421 --> 00:24:41,177
Prep for his anterior crown,
would you, please?

533
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,547
And l'm going to need
a few more cotton rolls.

534
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:45,141
OK.

535
00:24:46,813 --> 00:24:48,471
Hello, little fella.

536
00:24:48,508 --> 00:24:49,653
Aah!

537
00:24:49,693 --> 00:24:50,805
Heh heh heh!
Beauty, isn't he?

538
00:24:50,845 --> 00:24:52,121
I found that guy struggling for life...

539
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,782
out on the reef, and I saved him.1

540
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:56,787
So, has that Novocaine
kicked in yet?

541
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,894
I think so.
We're ready to roll.

542
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,545
Bubbles!

543
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:06,930
My bubbles.

544
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,281
He likes bubbles.

545
00:25:08,315 --> 00:25:11,861
Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh!

546
00:25:19,323 --> 00:25:20,501
- Bonjour.
- Aah!

547
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,224
Slow down, little fella.
There's nothing to worry about.

548
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,359
- He's scared to death.
- I want to go home.

549
00:25:26,396 --> 00:25:28,338
Do you know where my dad is?

550
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,031
Honey, your dad's probably
back at the pet store.

551
00:25:31,068 --> 00:25:32,181
Pet store?

552
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,806
Yeah, you know, like,
l'm from Bob's Fish Mart.

553
00:25:34,844 --> 00:25:36,338
- Pet Palace.
- Fish-O-Rama.

554
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,787
- MaiI order.
- Ebay.

555
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,406
- So, which one is it?
- l'm from the ocean.

556
00:25:40,444 --> 00:25:42,299
Ah, the ocean. The ocean?

557
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,154
Aah! Aah! Aah!

558
00:25:44,188 --> 00:25:46,773
He hasn't been decontaminated.
Jacques!

559
00:25:46,812 --> 00:25:48,088
-Oui.
-Clean him!

560
00:25:48,124 --> 00:25:49,585
Oui.

561
00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:51,963
- Ocean.
- Ooh, la mer. Bon.

562
00:25:53,724 --> 00:25:55,763
Voila. He is clean.

563
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,271
Wow. The big blue.
What's it like?

564
00:26:01,308 --> 00:26:05,170
- Big and blue?
- I knew it.

565
00:26:05,212 --> 00:26:08,278
lf there's anything you need,
just ask your Auntie Deb.

566
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,284
Or if l'm not around,
you can talk to my sister Flo.

567
00:26:11,324 --> 00:26:13,015
Hi. How are you?

568
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:14,514
Don't listen to anything my sister says.

569
00:26:14,556 --> 00:26:16,312
She's nuts.
Ha ha ha ha!

570
00:26:16,348 --> 00:26:17,395
We got a live one.

571
00:26:17,436 --> 00:26:20,338
- Can't hear you, Peach.
- I said we got a live one.

572
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,267
- Boy, oh, boy.
- What do we got?

573
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,762
Root canal--and by the looks
of those x-rays...

574
00:26:23,804 --> 00:26:25,211
it's not going to be pretty.

575
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:26,870
Ow!

576
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:28,282
- Dam and clamp installed?
- Yep.

577
00:26:28,316 --> 00:26:30,039
- What did he use to open?
- Gator-Glidden drill.

578
00:26:30,076 --> 00:26:31,669
He seems to favor
that one lately.

579
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:34,523
I can't see, Flo.

580
00:26:34,555 --> 00:26:36,595
You're getting a little too--Aah!

581
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:37,781
Now he's doing the Schilder technique.

582
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,162
He's usinga Hedstrom file.

583
00:26:39,196 --> 00:26:41,301
That's not a Hedstrom file.
That's a K-Flex.

584
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,819
lt has a teardrop cross-section.
Clearly a Hedstrom.

585
00:26:44,858 --> 00:26:46,287
-No, no, K-Flex.
-Hedstrom.

586
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,956
- K-Flex!
- Hedstrom!

587
00:26:47,994 --> 00:26:49,969
There I go.
A little help, over here.

588
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,798
l'lI go deflate him.

589
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:56,211
AlI right. Go ahead and rinse.

590
00:26:55,292 --> 00:26:58,488
Oh, the human mouth
is a disgusting place.

591
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,682
- Hey, Nigel.
- What did I miss?

592
00:27:02,716 --> 00:27:03,828
Root canal--a doozy.

593
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:05,428
Root canal?
What did he use to open?

594
00:27:05,468 --> 00:27:07,410
- Gator-Glidden drill.
- He's favoring that one.

595
00:27:07,451 --> 00:27:10,321
Hope he doesn't get surplus
sealer at the portaI terminus.

596
00:27:10,364 --> 00:27:13,331
- Hello. Who's this?
- New guy. Ha ha ha!

597
00:27:13,371 --> 00:27:14,648
The dentist took him off the reef.

598
00:27:14,683 --> 00:27:16,952
An outie. From my neck of the woods, eh?

599
00:27:16,988 --> 00:27:18,417
Sorry if I ever took a snap at you.

600
00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:19,801
Fish gotta swim,
birds gotta eat.

601
00:27:19,835 --> 00:27:21,461
Hey! No, no, no, no!

602
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:23,026
They're not your fish.
They're my fish.

603
00:27:24,026 --> 00:27:26,710
Come on, go.
Go on, shoo!

604
00:27:27,036 --> 00:27:28,629
Aw, the picture broke.

605
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:30,642
This here's Darla.
She's my niece.

606
00:27:30,683 --> 00:27:32,090
She's going to be eight this week.

607
00:27:32,123 --> 00:27:33,530
Hey, little fella.

608
00:27:33,563 --> 00:27:35,254
Say hello to your new mummy.

609
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:37,658
She'lI be here Friday to pick you up.

610
00:27:37,691 --> 00:27:39,442
You're her present.
Shh, shh, shh.

611
00:27:39,483 --> 00:27:41,458
lt's our little secret.

612
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:42,960
Well, Mr. Tucker,
while that sets up...

613
00:27:43,004 --> 00:27:44,891
l'm going to see a man
about a wallaby.

614
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:48,473
Oh, Darla.

615
00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:50,296
What?
What's wrong with her?

616
00:27:50,332 --> 00:27:52,917
She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.

617
00:27:52,955 --> 00:27:56,567
- Poor Chuckles.
- He was her present last year.

618
00:27:56,603 --> 00:27:58,872
Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.

619
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,772
She's a fish killer.

620
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:04,983
I can't go with that girl.

621
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:06,710
I have to get back to my dad.

622
00:28:06,747 --> 00:28:10,489
Aah! Daddy! Help me!

623
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:11,636
Oh, he's stuck.

624
00:28:11,675 --> 00:28:13,780
Nobody touch him.

625
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:17,850
Nobody touch him.

626
00:28:24,314 --> 00:28:25,688
Can you help me?

627
00:28:24,763 --> 00:28:25,115
No. You got yourself in there.

628
00:28:25,115 --> 00:28:26,675
No. You got yourself in there.

629
00:28:26,715 --> 00:28:28,308
You can get yourself out.

630
00:28:28,347 --> 00:28:30,518
- Gill--
- I want to see him do it.

631
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:34,232
Calm down. Alternate wiggling
your fins and your tail.

632
00:28:34,267 --> 00:28:36,950
I can't. I have a bad fin.

633
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:39,059
Never stopped me.

634
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,426
Just think about what you need to do.

635
00:28:49,243 --> 00:28:50,705
Come on.

636
00:28:54,747 --> 00:28:55,892
Perfect.

637
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,239
- Yay!
- You did it!

638
00:28:57,275 --> 00:28:58,966
Good squirming.
Ha ha ha!

639
00:28:59,002 --> 00:29:02,450
Wow. From the ocean--
just like you, Gill.

640
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,603
Yeah.

641
00:29:03,643 --> 00:29:05,912
l've seen that look before.

642
00:29:05,947 --> 00:29:07,540
What are you thinking about?

643
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,270
l'm thinking...

644
00:29:09,307 --> 00:29:12,722
tonight, we give the kid
a proper reception.

645
00:29:12,762 --> 00:29:14,355
So, kid,
you got a name or what?

646
00:29:14,395 --> 00:29:16,980
Nemo. l'm Nemo.

647
00:29:19,034 --> 00:29:21,401
Nemo. Nemo.

648
00:29:26,394 --> 00:29:28,020
Are you gonna eat that?

649
00:29:39,098 --> 00:29:42,611
- CarefuI with that hammer.
- Huh?

650
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:47,669
No, no.

651
00:29:47,707 --> 00:29:49,845
What does it say? Dory!

652
00:29:49,882 --> 00:29:51,442
A sea monkey has my money.

653
00:29:51,482 --> 00:29:53,654
Wake up. Get up. Come on.

654
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:54,618
Come on!

655
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,789
- Yes, l'm a naturaI blue.

656
00:29:56,826 --> 00:29:59,925
Look out!
Sharks eat fish! Aah!

657
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:05,753
- Aah!

658
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,584
Aah!

659
00:30:21,114 --> 00:30:23,088
Wow. Dusty.

660
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,591
The mask. Where's the mask?

661
00:30:26,202 --> 00:30:28,024
No! No, not the mask!

662
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:30,480
Get it! Get the mask!
Get the mask! Get it!

663
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:41,492
lt just keeps going on,
doesn't it?

664
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,831
Echo! Echo!

665
00:30:43,866 --> 00:30:45,044
Hey, what you doing?

666
00:30:45,082 --> 00:30:46,292
lt's gone. l've lost the mask.

667
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,272
- Did you drop it?
- You dropped it!

668
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:49,841
That was my only chance of finding my son.

669
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:52,086
Now it's gone.

670
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:58,295
Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills...

671
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,857
when life gets you down,
know what you got to do?

672
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:02,232
- I don't want to know.
- Just keep swimming.

673
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:05,561
Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming

674
00:31:05,594 --> 00:31:07,732
What do we do?
We swim, swim

675
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,947
Dory, no singing.

676
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:13,233
I love to swim

677
00:31:13,274 --> 00:31:15,608
When you want to swim

678
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,551
See, l'm going to get
stuck now with that song.

679
00:31:17,594 --> 00:31:21,657
- Now it's in my head.
- Sorry.

680
00:31:21,657 --> 00:31:23,032
Dory, do you see anything?

681
00:31:23,065 --> 00:31:24,724
- Aah! Something's got me.
- That was me. l'm sorry.

682
00:31:24,762 --> 00:31:27,991
- Who's that?
- Who could it be? lt's me.

683
00:31:28,025 --> 00:31:31,157
Are you my conscience?

684
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:33,714
Yeah, yeah. l'm your conscience.

685
00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:36,536
We haven't spoken for a while.
How are you?

686
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,741
- Can't complain.
- Yeah? Good.

687
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:40,435
Now, Dory, I want you to telI me...

688
00:31:40,474 --> 00:31:42,132
Do you see anything?

689

I see a...I see a light.

690

- A light?
- Yeah. Over there.

691
00:31:48,154 --> 00:31:51,470
- Hey, conscience, am I dead?
- No. I see it, too.

692
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:00,751
What is it?

693
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:05,398
lt's so pretty.

694
00:32:05,434 --> 00:32:10,038
l'm feeling...happy...

695
00:32:10,073 --> 00:32:13,422
which is a big deaI for me.

696
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:14,894
I want to touch it.

697
00:32:14,938 --> 00:32:16,399
- Oh.

698
00:32:16,441 --> 00:32:18,743

l'm gonna be your best friend

704
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:28,530
Good feeling's gone.

705
00:32:31,065 --> 00:32:32,658
- Whoa!
- Waah!

706
00:32:35,097 --> 00:32:37,748
I can't see!
I don't know where l'm going!

707
00:32:37,785 --> 00:32:38,713
Haah!

708
00:32:38,713 --> 00:32:39,542
DORY: Haah!

709
00:32:39,577 --> 00:32:41,464
- The mask!
- What mask?

710
00:32:41,497 --> 00:32:43,701
OK, I can't see a thing.

711
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:47,253
- Oh, gee.
- Hey, look, a mask.

712
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:48,882
Read it!

713
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:50,481
I'm sorry, but if you could just...

714
00:32:50,521 --> 00:32:51,993
bring it a little closer,
I kind of need the light.

715
00:32:51,993 --> 00:32:52,374
bring it a little closer,
I kind of need the light.

716
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:55,224
That's great. Keep it right there.

717
00:32:55,257 --> 00:32:57,875
- Just read it!
- OK, OK.

718
00:32:57,913 --> 00:33:00,815
Mr. Bossy. Uh, ''P.''

719
00:33:00,857 --> 00:33:03,704
OK. ''P. Sher...''

720
00:33:03,737 --> 00:33:06,704
''Sher--P. Sher--''
P. Shirley? P.--''

721
00:33:08,537 --> 00:33:10,741
Oh. The first line's
''P. Sherman.''

722
00:33:10,776 --> 00:33:12,881
''P. Sherman'' doesn't make any sense!

723
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:15,059
OK. Second line. ''42.''

724
00:33:15,097 --> 00:33:16,984
Don't eat me. Don't eat me. Aah!

725
00:33:18,649 --> 00:33:20,176
Light, please!

726
00:33:21,496 --> 00:33:23,952
''Walla--walla--''

727
00:33:23,993 --> 00:33:26,775
Waah! Waah! Waah!

728
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:28,499
The second line's: ''42 Wallaby Way.''

729
00:33:28,537 --> 00:33:31,220
That's great.
Speed read. Take a guess.

730
00:33:31,257 --> 00:33:32,817
No pressure. No problem.
There's a lot of pressure.

731
00:33:32,856 --> 00:33:35,278
Pressure! Take a guess
now with pressure!

732
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:38,288
- ''Sydney''! lt's ''Sydney''!
- Duck!

733
00:33:38,328 --> 00:33:40,183
Aah!

734
00:33:40,217 --> 00:33:43,478
l'm dead. l'm dead, l'm dead, l'm dead.

735
00:33:43,513 --> 00:33:44,822
I died. l'm dead.

736
00:33:51,545 --> 00:33:52,821
Whoo-hoo!

737
00:33:52,857 --> 00:33:54,580
We did it, we did it

738
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:56,242
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

739
00:33:56,281 --> 00:33:58,037
No eating here tonight, whoo!

740
00:33:58,072 --> 00:33:59,381
Eating here tonight

741
00:33:59,417 --> 00:34:00,660
No, no, no, eating here tonight

742
00:34:00,696 --> 00:34:02,103
-Dory.
- You on a diet.

743
00:34:02,136 --> 00:34:04,853
Dory!
What did the mask say?

744
00:34:04,888 --> 00:34:06,644
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

745
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,720
I remembered what it said!

746
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,149
I usually forget things,
but I remembered it!

747
00:34:11,193 --> 00:34:12,786
Whoa, whoa, wait. Where is that?

748
00:34:12,824 --> 00:34:15,158
I don't know.
But who cares? I remembered.

749
00:34:15,193 --> 00:34:16,338
- Raar!
- Aah!

750
00:34:16,376 --> 00:34:18,515
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

751
00:34:18,552 --> 00:34:20,494
I remembered it again!

752
00:34:46,104 --> 00:34:48,974

Sharkbait, oo-ha-ha!

801
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,901
- Enough with the Sharkbait.
- Sharkbait!

802
00:37:09,943 --> 00:37:11,732
Ooh...ba-ba-do.

803
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:13,261
Sharkbait's one of us now, agreed?

804
00:37:13,303 --> 00:37:15,277
- Agreed.
- We can't send him to his death.

805
00:37:15,318 --> 00:37:17,326
Darla's coming in five days.

806
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:18,861
So, what are we going to do?

807
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,358
l'lI telI you what we're gonna do--

808
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:22,893
we're gonna get him out of here.

809
00:37:22,935 --> 00:37:25,357
- We'lI help him escape.
- Escape? Really?

810
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:26,806
We're alI gonna escape.

811
00:37:26,838 --> 00:37:29,359
Gill, please.
Not another escape plan.

812
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:31,341
Sorry, but they just never work.

813
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:32,471
Why should this be any different?

814
00:37:32,471 --> 00:37:32,852
Why should this be any different?

815
00:37:32,887 --> 00:37:36,203
-Because we've got him.
-Me?

816
00:37:36,246 --> 00:37:37,943
- You see that filter?
- Yeah.

817
00:37:37,943 --> 00:37:41,238
You're the only one who can get
in and out of that thing.

818
00:37:41,271 --> 00:37:44,304
We need you to take
a pebble inside there...

819
00:37:44,343 --> 00:37:45,520
and jam the gears.

820
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:47,446
You do that, and this tank's gonna get...

821
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:49,366
filthier and filthier
by the minute.

822
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:51,635
Pretty soon, the dentist'll
have to clean the tank...

823
00:37:51,671 --> 00:37:54,453
and when he does, he'lI take us
out of the tank...

824
00:37:54,486 --> 00:37:55,980
put us in individuaI baggies...

825
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,746
then we'lI rolI ourselves down the counter...

826
00:37:57,783 --> 00:37:59,375
out the window, off the awning...

827
00:37:59,415 --> 00:38:01,008
into the bushes, across the street...

828
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:03,413
and into the harbor!

829
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,261
lt's foolproof. Who's with me?

830
00:38:06,295 --> 00:38:07,637
- Aye!
- Aye!

831
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,044
I think you're nuts.

832
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:12,883
No offense, kid,
but you're not the best swimmer.

833
00:38:12,918 --> 00:38:15,220
He's fine. He can do this.

834
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:18,571
So, Sharkbait,
what do you think?

835
00:38:18,615 --> 00:38:23,350
Let's do it.

836
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:26,198
l'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

837
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,474
Where are you going?

838
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:29,104
l'm going to P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

839
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:30,702
lf you ask where l'm going...

840
00:38:30,743 --> 00:38:32,401
l'lI telI you that's where l'm going.

841
00:38:32,438 --> 00:38:33,845
lt's P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

842
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:35,569
Where? l'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

843
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:37,100
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

844
00:38:37,142 --> 00:38:39,826
Excuse me.

845
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:41,585
Hi. Do you know how to get...

846
00:38:41,622 --> 00:38:44,469
Hello? Whoa. Wait.
Can you telI me--

847
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:48,658
Hey! Hold it!
l'm trying to talk to you!

848
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:51,923
Fellas, come back here.
One quick question.

849
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:56,181
I need to... And they're gone again.

850
00:38:56,215 --> 00:38:57,905
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

851
00:38:57,942 --> 00:38:59,535
Why do I have to telI you
over and over again?

852
00:38:59,574 --> 00:39:01,483
l'lI telI you again.
I don't get tired of it--

853
00:39:01,526 --> 00:39:02,638
- OK, alI right.
- Huh?

854
00:39:02,678 --> 00:39:04,304
- Here's the thing.
- Uh-huh.

855
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:09,612
I think it's best
if I carry on from here by...

856
00:39:09,654 --> 00:39:10,963
by myself.

857
00:39:10,998 --> 00:39:12,143
OK.

858
00:39:12,182 --> 00:39:13,808
- You know, alone.
- Uh-huh.

859
00:39:13,846 --> 00:39:15,788
Without... without... I mean, not without you.

860
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:19,059
But I don't
want you...with me.

861
00:39:19,094 --> 00:39:21,331
- Huh?
- Am l...

862
00:39:21,366 --> 00:39:22,479
I don't want to hurt
your feelings.

863
00:39:22,518 --> 00:39:25,201
- You want me to leave?
- I mean, not--Yes.

864
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,572
I just can't afford any more delays...

865
00:39:27,606 --> 00:39:30,672
and you're one of those fish
that cause delays.

866
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,270
Sometimes it's a good thing.

867
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,212
There's a whole group of fish.
They're delay fish.

868
00:39:35,254 --> 00:39:36,748
You mean...

869
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,383
You mean you don't like me?

870
00:39:38,422 --> 00:39:40,145
No, of course I like you.

871
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:42,767
lt's because I like you
I don't want to be with you.

872
00:39:42,805 --> 00:39:44,878
lt's a complicated emotion.

873
00:39:44,918 --> 00:39:48,464
- Ohh!
- Don't cry. I like you.

874
00:39:48,502 --> 00:39:52,692
Hey, you!
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

875
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:54,580
Um...I don't remember.
Were you?

876
00:39:54,614 --> 00:39:56,436
No, no, no, no, no. We're just--

877
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,160
Do you guys know
how I can get to--

878
00:39:58,198 --> 00:40:00,434
Look, pal, we're talking
to the lady, not you.

879
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,997
Hey, hey.
You like impressions?

880
00:40:02,038 --> 00:40:03,980
Mm-hmm.

881
00:40:04,022 --> 00:40:06,258
Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen.

882
00:40:06,294 --> 00:40:07,788
So what are we?
Take a guess.

883
00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:09,073
Oh, oh.
l've seen one of those.

884
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,215
l'm a fish with a nose like a sword.

885
00:40:11,253 --> 00:40:13,141
- Wait, wait, um--
- lt's a swordfish!

886
00:40:13,173 --> 00:40:14,870
Hey, clown boy, let the lady guess.

887
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,080
Hey, clown boy, let the lady guess.

888
00:40:16,117 --> 00:40:17,612
Where's the butter?

889
00:40:17,654 --> 00:40:18,995
Ooh! lt's on the tip of my tongue!

890
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,939
- Lobster.
- Saw that!

891
00:40:20,982 --> 00:40:22,738
Lots of legs! Live in the ocean.

892
00:40:22,773 --> 00:40:24,115
- Clam!
- Close enough!

893
00:40:27,062 --> 00:40:28,010
They're good.

894
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:29,297
WilI somebody please
give me directions?!

895
00:40:29,334 --> 00:40:31,603
''WilI somebody please give me directions?!''

896
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,579
-Ha ha ha ha ha!
-l'm serious!

897
00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:35,531
''Blah blah blah, me, me, blah!

898
00:40:36,758 --> 00:40:38,187
''Blah blah blah, me, me, me!''

899
00:40:36,758 --> 00:40:38,187
Thank you.

900
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,619
Oh, dear. Hey!
Hey, come back!

901
00:40:40,661 --> 00:40:42,709
-Hey, what's the matter?
-What's the matter?

902
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:43,211
- Hey, what's the matter?
- What's the matter?

903
00:40:43,253 --> 00:40:45,141
While they're doing their silly little impressions...

904
00:40:45,173 --> 00:40:49,134
I am miles from home with a fish
that can't remember her name!

905
00:40:49,173 --> 00:40:50,417
I bet that's frustrating.

906
00:40:50,454 --> 00:40:51,828
Meanwhile,
my son is out there.

907
00:40:51,862 --> 00:40:53,771
- Your son Chico?
- Nemo?

908
00:40:53,813 --> 00:40:55,155
But it doesn't matter
because no fish...

909
00:40:55,189 --> 00:40:57,077
in this entire ocean
is going to help me.

910
00:40:57,109 --> 00:41:00,721
Well, l'm helping you.

911
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,034
Wait right here.

912
00:41:03,221 --> 00:41:05,709
- Guys!
- ls he bothering you again?

913
00:41:05,749 --> 00:41:07,211
No, no. He's a good guy.

914
00:41:07,253 --> 00:41:08,213
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

915
00:41:08,213 --> 00:41:09,391
Go easy on him.
He's lost his son Fabio.

916
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:12,179
Any of you heard of P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

917
00:41:12,277 --> 00:41:14,798
Sydney? Oh, sure!

918
00:41:14,837 --> 00:41:16,495
Ted here's got relatives in Sydney.

919
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:18,093
- Don't you, Ted?
- Sure do!

920
00:41:18,133 --> 00:41:19,562
Oh! Hey!
They know Sydney!

921
00:41:20,757 --> 00:41:22,186
You wouldn't know how to get there, would you?

922
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,117
You want to follow the E.A.C.

923
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,735
That's the East Australian Current.

924
00:41:26,773 --> 00:41:28,334
Big current. Can't miss it.

925
00:41:28,373 --> 00:41:31,220
lt's in...that direction.

926
00:41:31,253 --> 00:41:33,075
And then you follow that
for about...

927
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:34,799
I don't know. What do you guys think?

928
00:41:34,837 --> 00:41:35,949
About three leagues?

929
00:41:35,989 --> 00:41:38,836
That little baby wilI put you
right past Sydney.

930
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:41,203
- Ta-da!
- That's great!

931
00:41:41,236 --> 00:41:42,381
Dory, you did it!

932
00:41:42,421 --> 00:41:44,177
Oh, please, l'm just your little helper.

933
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:46,450
- Helping along. That's me.
- Fellas, thank you.

934
00:41:46,485 --> 00:41:49,966
Don't mention it!
Just loosen up, OK, buddy?

935
00:41:50,005 --> 00:41:52,874
Oh, you guys.
You really nailed him. Bye.

936
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:54,672
Oh, hey, ma'am.
One more thing.

937
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:58,124
When you come to this trench,
swim through it, not over it.

938
00:41:58,164 --> 00:41:59,986
Trench...
through it, not over it.

939
00:42:00,021 --> 00:42:02,607
l'lI remember. Hey, hey!

940
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:06,160
Hey, wait up, partner!
Hold on!

941
00:42:06,196 --> 00:42:08,814
Wait, wait, wait!
I gotta telI you something.

942
00:42:08,853 --> 00:42:11,438
Whoa.

943
00:42:11,477 --> 00:42:13,681
Nice trench.

944
00:42:15,348 --> 00:42:18,218
Hello!

945
00:42:20,821 --> 00:42:23,341
- OK, let's go.
- No, no. Bad trench.

946
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,973
Come on, we'lI swim over
this thing.

947
00:42:25,012 --> 00:42:27,052
Whoa, partner.
Little red flag going up.

948
00:42:27,093 --> 00:42:30,573
Something's telling me
to swim through it, not over it.

949
00:42:30,612 --> 00:42:32,173
Are you looking at this thing?

950
00:42:32,213 --> 00:42:33,642
lt's got death written alI over it.

951
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:36,401
I really, really, really
think we should swim through.

952
00:42:36,436 --> 00:42:38,575
And l'm really, really done
talking about this. Over we go.

953
00:42:38,613 --> 00:42:40,500
- Trust me on this.
- Trust you?

954
00:42:40,532 --> 00:42:42,321
Yes, trust.
lt's what friends do.

955
00:42:42,357 --> 00:42:44,179
Look! Something shiny!

956
00:42:44,212 --> 00:42:45,903
- Where?
- lt just swam over the trench.

957
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:51,413
- Come on, we'lI follow it!
- OK!

958
00:42:51,413 --> 00:42:53,966
Boy, it sure is clear up here.

959
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:57,320
Exactly. And look at that--
there's the current.

960
00:42:57,364 --> 00:42:59,852
We should be there in no time.

961
00:42:59,893 --> 00:43:01,616
Hey, little guy.

962
00:43:01,652 --> 00:43:03,343
You wanted to go
through the trench.

963
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:05,323
I shalI calI him Squishy, and he shalI be mine.

964
00:43:05,364 --> 00:43:07,436
And he shalI be my Squishy.
Come here, Squishy.

965
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,914
Come here, little Squishy.

966
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:10,607
Ow!

967
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,610
- That's a jellyfish!
- Bad Squishy!

968
00:43:14,644 --> 00:43:16,368
Shoo, shoo! Get away!

969
00:43:16,404 --> 00:43:18,608
-Let me see that.
-Don't touch it.

970
00:43:18,644 --> 00:43:20,881
I won't touch it.
I just want to look.

971
00:43:20,916 --> 00:43:22,858
Hey! How come
it didn't sting you?

972
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,361
lt did.
lt's just that--

973
00:43:24,404 --> 00:43:26,030
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Hold still.

974
00:43:26,068 --> 00:43:27,475
I live in this anemone...

975
00:43:27,508 --> 00:43:29,296
and l'm used
to these kind of stings.

976
00:43:29,332 --> 00:43:30,444
Ow! Ow! Ow!

977
00:43:30,484 --> 00:43:32,393
lt doesn't look bad.
You'lI be fine.

978
00:43:32,436 --> 00:43:34,095
But now we know, don't we...

979
00:43:34,132 --> 00:43:36,237
that we don't want
to touch these again.

980
00:43:36,276 --> 00:43:39,178
Let's be thankfuI this time
it was just a little one.

981
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,521
- Aah!
- Aah!

982
00:43:41,556 --> 00:43:42,766
Don't move.

983
00:43:44,532 --> 00:43:45,300
- This is bad, Dory.
- Hey, watch this!

984
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,307
- This is bad, Dory.
- Hey, watch this!

985
00:43:47,348 --> 00:43:48,941
Boing! Boing!

986
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,157
Dory!

987
00:43:50,196 --> 00:43:52,432
You can't catch me

988
00:43:52,468 --> 00:43:53,875
Don't bounce on the tops!

989
00:43:53,908 --> 00:43:56,908
They will...not sting you!

990
00:43:56,948 --> 00:43:59,501
- The tops don't sting you!
- Two in a row! Beat that!

991
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,354
Dory, listen to me.
I have an idea--a game.

992
00:44:02,388 --> 00:44:03,795
-A game?
-Yes.

993
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:06,445
- I love games! Pick me!
- Here's the game.

994
00:44:06,484 --> 00:44:09,800
Whoever can hop the fastest
out of these jellyfish wins!

995
00:44:09,843 --> 00:44:11,404
- OK.
- Rules, rules, rules!

996
00:44:11,444 --> 00:44:13,899
You can't touch the tentacles.
Only the tops.

997
00:44:13,939 --> 00:44:15,728
Something about tentacles.
Got it. Go!

998
00:44:15,764 --> 00:44:18,578
Wait! Not something about 'em,
it's alI about 'em!

999
00:44:18,612 --> 00:44:19,757
- Whee!
- Wait, Dory!

1000
00:44:19,795 --> 00:44:20,468
Gotta go faster if you want to win!

1001
00:44:20,468 --> 00:44:21,809
Gotta go faster
if you want to win!

1002
00:44:21,844 --> 00:44:22,956
Whoa! Dory!

1003
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:24,883
Boing, boing, boing!

1004
00:44:24,916 --> 00:44:27,665
Wait a minute! Whoa! Dory!

1005
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,161
Whee!

1006
00:44:29,203 --> 00:44:32,335
We're cheating death now.
That's what we're doing.

1007
00:44:32,371 --> 00:44:33,964
But we're having fun
at the same time.

1008
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:35,378
I can do this.
Just be careful.

1009
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:37,233
Yeah, carefuI I don't
make you cry when I win!

1010
00:44:37,268 --> 00:44:38,380
I don't think so!

1011
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,881
Ha ha ha ha!

1012
00:44:39,924 --> 00:44:41,647
Whoa!

1013
00:44:41,683 --> 00:44:42,796
Give it up, old man.

1014
00:44:42,835 --> 00:44:45,006
You can't fight evolution.
I was built for speed.

1015
00:44:45,044 --> 00:44:46,931
The question is, Dory,
are you hungry?

1016
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:48,240
- Hungry?
- Yeah.

1017
00:44:48,276 --> 00:44:50,894
'Cause you're about
to eat my bubbles!

1018
00:44:50,931 --> 00:44:53,004
Duck to the left!
Right there!

1019
00:44:55,283 --> 00:44:57,618
The clownfish is the winner!

1020
00:44:57,651 --> 00:45:00,586
Whoo-hoo! We did it!
Look at us!

1021
00:45:00,627 --> 00:45:02,092
Dory?

1022
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:05,577
Oh, no.

1023
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:08,807
Dory! Dory!

1024
00:45:08,843 --> 00:45:10,850
Dory!

1025
00:45:12,747 --> 00:45:14,886
Dory!

1026
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:16,679
Ohh!

1027
00:45:18,891 --> 00:45:21,509
Am I disqualified?

1028
00:45:21,547 --> 00:45:23,434
No, you're doing fine!
You're actually winning!

1029
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:26,466
But you gotta stay awake.
Where does P. Sherman live?

1030
00:45:26,507 --> 00:45:29,289
P. Sherman...
Wallaby Way, Sydney...

1031
00:45:29,323 --> 00:45:31,014
That's it!

1032
00:45:31,051 --> 00:45:32,163
Uhh!

1033
00:45:32,203 --> 00:45:34,789
- Wallaby Way...
- Uhh! Stay awake!

1034
00:45:34,827 --> 00:45:37,031
Stay awake!
Ooh! Stay awake!

1035
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:40,678
Stay...awake!

1036
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:46,246
- Awake.
- P. Sherman.

1037
00:45:46,283 --> 00:45:49,152
- Awake.
- 42 Wallaby Way.

1038
00:45:49,195 --> 00:45:52,618
Wake up. Nemo...

1039
00:45:52,618 --> 00:45:53,000
Wake up. Nemo...

1040
00:46:07,115 --> 00:46:09,384
You miss your dad,
don't you, Sharkbait?

1041
00:46:09,419 --> 00:46:10,251
Yeah.

1042
00:46:10,251 --> 00:46:10,720
Yeah.

1043
00:46:10,762 --> 00:46:14,592
You're lucky to have someone
out there looking for you.

1044
00:46:14,635 --> 00:46:16,707
He's not looking for me.

1045
00:46:16,747 --> 00:46:19,976
He's scared of the ocean.

1046
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:21,504
Peach, any movement?

1047
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:24,360
He's had four cups of coffee.
lt's gotta be soon.

1048
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:25,856
Keep on him.

1049
00:46:28,171 --> 00:46:30,888
My first escape--
landed on dentaI tools.

1050
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:32,296
I was aiming for the toilet.

1051
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,476
Toilet?

1052
00:46:33,514 --> 00:46:36,002
AlI drains
lead to the ocean, kid.

1053
00:46:36,042 --> 00:46:39,174
Wow. How many times have
you tried to get out?

1054
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,737
Ah, l've lost count.

1055
00:46:40,778 --> 00:46:42,633
Fish aren't meant
to be in a box, kid.

1056
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,259
lt does things to you.

1057
00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:46,339
Bubbles! Bubbles!

1058
00:46:46,378 --> 00:46:48,647
Potty break! He grabbed
the ''Reader's Digest.''

1059
00:46:48,682 --> 00:46:51,944
- We have 4.2 minutes!
- That's your cue, Sharkbait.

1060
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:54,183
- You can do it, kid.
- We gotta be quick.

1061
00:46:54,218 --> 00:46:54,411
Once you get in, swim to
the bottom of the chamber...

1062
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,745
Once you get in, swim to
the bottom of the chamber...

1063
00:46:56,779 --> 00:46:58,469
and l'lI talk you
through the rest.

1064
00:46:58,506 --> 00:47:01,189
- OK.
- lt'lI be a piece of kelp.

1065
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:10,599
Nicely done!

1066
00:47:10,634 --> 00:47:12,292
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah!

1067
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,719
Here comes the pebble.

1068
00:47:15,946 --> 00:47:17,091
Ptoo.

1069
00:47:19,466 --> 00:47:22,150
Now, do you see
a smalI opening?

1070
00:47:22,186 --> 00:47:23,561
Uh-huh!

1071
00:47:23,594 --> 00:47:26,628
lnside it,
you'lI see a rotating fan.

1072
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:31,008
Wedge that pebble into the fan
to stop it turning.

1073
00:47:34,282 --> 00:47:35,525
Aah!

1074
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:37,766
- Careful, Sharkbait!
- I can't do it!

1075
00:47:37,802 --> 00:47:39,264
Gill, this isn't a good idea.

1076
00:47:39,306 --> 00:47:40,997
He'lI be fine. Try again!

1077
00:47:41,034 --> 00:47:43,620
OK.

1078
00:47:43,658 --> 00:47:46,025
That's it, Sharkbait.

1079
00:47:46,058 --> 00:47:48,261
Nice and steady.

1080
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,128
I got it! I got it!

1081
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,788
- He did it!
- That's great, kid!

1082
00:47:54,826 --> 00:47:56,931
Now swim up the tube
and out.

1083
00:48:13,514 --> 00:48:16,132
Oh, no! Gill!

1084
00:48:16,169 --> 00:48:17,314
- Sharkbait!
- Oh, my gosh!

1085
00:48:17,354 --> 00:48:18,531
Get him outta there!

1086
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:20,991
- What do we do?
- Oh, no!

1087
00:48:21,034 --> 00:48:22,921
Stay calm, kid.
Just don't panic!

1088
00:48:23,914 --> 00:48:25,255
Help me!

1089
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:27,559
Sharkbait, grab hold of this!

1090
00:48:30,921 --> 00:48:32,809
- No! No! No!
- Feed me more!

1091
00:48:32,841 --> 00:48:35,656
- That's it!
- Sharkbait! Grab it!

1092
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:38,275
I got it!

1093
00:48:38,313 --> 00:48:40,037
Pull!

1094
00:48:46,441 --> 00:48:49,027
Gill, don't make him
go back in there.

1095
00:48:50,217 --> 00:48:54,079
No. We're done.

1096
00:49:06,601 --> 00:49:08,227
Dude.

1097
00:49:08,265 --> 00:49:11,200
- Uhh.
- Dude.

1098
00:49:11,241 --> 00:49:15,551
Focus, dude. Dude.

1099
00:49:15,593 --> 00:49:17,153
Ohh.

1100
00:49:17,194 --> 00:49:18,720
Oh, he lives.
Hey, dude!

1101
00:49:18,762 --> 00:49:21,991
Ohh. What happened?

1102
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:24,000
Saw the whole thing, dude.

1103
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:25,830
First, you were all,
like, ''Whoa!''...

1104
00:49:25,865 --> 00:49:27,426
and then we were all, like, ''Whoa!''...

1105
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,287
and then you were, like, ''Whoa.''

1106
00:49:29,322 --> 00:49:30,696
What are you talking about?

1107
00:49:30,729 --> 00:49:34,025
You, mini-man.
Takin' on the jellies.

1108
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:36,774
You got serious
thrilI issues, dude.

1109
00:49:36,809 --> 00:49:38,019
- Ohh.
- Awesome.

1110
00:49:38,057 --> 00:49:41,123
Uhh. Oh, my stomach. Ohh!

1111
00:49:41,161 --> 00:49:43,048
Oh, man. No hurlin'
on the shell, dude, OK?

1112
00:49:43,081 --> 00:49:44,226
Just waxed it.

1113
00:49:44,265 --> 00:49:46,404
So, Mr. Turtle--

1114
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:48,710
Whoa, dude.
Mr. Turtle is my father.

1115
00:49:48,745 --> 00:49:50,119
The name's Crush.

1116
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,389
Crush? Really?

1117
00:49:52,425 --> 00:49:56,898
OK, Crush. I need to
the East Australian Current.

1118
00:49:56,937 --> 00:49:58,115
E.A.C.?

1119
00:49:58,153 --> 00:50:00,008
Oh, dude.

1120
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:02,310
You're ridin' it, dude!

1121
00:50:02,345 --> 00:50:04,865
Check it out!

1122
00:50:24,937 --> 00:50:26,725
OK, grab shell, dude!

1123
00:50:26,761 --> 00:50:28,457
Grab wh-a-a-at?!

1124
00:50:28,457 --> 00:50:28,991
Grab wh-a-a-at?!

1125
00:50:37,448 --> 00:50:40,001
Ha ha! Righteous! Righteous!

1126
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:44,585
- Yeah!
- Stop!

1127
00:50:44,585 --> 00:50:46,951
So...

1128
00:50:46,984 --> 00:50:50,367
What brings you on this fine day
to the E.A.C.?

1129
00:50:50,409 --> 00:50:52,897
Dory and I need
to get to Sydney.

1130
00:50:52,937 --> 00:50:55,075
Dory!
ls she alI right?

1131
00:50:55,113 --> 00:50:56,836
Huh? Oh, little blue.

1132
00:50:57,896 --> 00:50:59,423
She is sub-level, dude.

1133
00:51:03,401 --> 00:51:05,856
Dory! Dory! Dory!

1134
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,554
Dory.

1135
00:51:09,224 --> 00:51:11,941
l'm so sorry.

1136
00:51:11,977 --> 00:51:15,173
This is alI my fault.
lt's my fault.

1137
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:19,976
Twenty-nine, thirty!
Ready or not, here I come!

1138
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:21,918
There you are!

1139
00:51:23,144 --> 00:51:25,894
Catch me if you can!

1140
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:28,198
Dory?

1141
00:51:28,232 --> 00:51:29,988
Nice wave!

1142
00:51:30,025 --> 00:51:31,967
Oh, wow!

1143
00:51:32,008 --> 00:51:33,601
Heh heh.

1144
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,056
Up you go!

1145
00:51:34,056 --> 00:51:35,398
Up you go!

1146
00:51:35,433 --> 00:51:38,302
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

1147
00:51:38,344 --> 00:51:39,718
Whoa! Whoa!

1148
00:51:40,968 --> 00:51:43,205
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

1149
00:51:45,032 --> 00:51:47,520
- Oh, my goodness!
- KilI the motor, dude.

1150
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,757
Let us see what Squirt does
flying solo.

1151
00:51:56,264 --> 00:51:58,849
Whoa!

1152
00:51:58,888 --> 00:52:01,757
Whoa! That was so cool!

1153
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,524
Hey, Dad, did you see that?

1154
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,797
Did you see me?
Did you see what I did?

1155
00:52:05,832 --> 00:52:08,679
You so totally rock, Squirt!

1156
00:52:08,712 --> 00:52:10,174
So give me some fin.

1157
00:52:10,216 --> 00:52:11,557
Noggin.

1158
00:52:11,592 --> 00:52:12,901
- Dude.
- Dude.

1159
00:52:12,936 --> 00:52:14,277
Oh...intro.

1160
00:52:14,312 --> 00:52:16,134
Jellyman, offspring.

1161
00:52:16,168 --> 00:52:18,142
Offspring, Jellyman.

1162
00:52:18,183 --> 00:52:21,566
- Jellies?! Sweet.
- Totally.

1163
00:52:21,608 --> 00:52:24,707
Apparently, I must've done
something you liked...dudes.

1164
00:52:24,744 --> 00:52:27,078
- You rock, dude!
- Ow.

1165
00:52:27,112 --> 00:52:31,651
CurI away, my son.
lt's awesome, Jellyman.

1166
00:52:31,688 --> 00:52:33,281
The little dudes are just eggs.

1167
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,011
We leave 'em on a beach to hatch...

1168
00:52:35,048 --> 00:52:36,258
and then, coo-coo-cachoo...

1169
00:52:36,296 --> 00:52:38,597
they find their way back
to the big ol' blue.

1170
00:52:38,632 --> 00:52:40,868
- AlI by themselves?
- Yeah.

1171
00:52:40,904 --> 00:52:43,773
But, dude, how do you know
when they're ready?

1172
00:52:43,815 --> 00:52:44,993
Well, you never really know.

1173
00:52:45,032 --> 00:52:48,293
But when they know,
you'lI know, you know? Ha.

1174
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,734
Hey, look, everybody.

1175
00:52:53,767 --> 00:52:56,353
I know that dude!
lt's the Jellyman!

1176
00:52:56,391 --> 00:52:58,333
Go on. Jump on him!

1177
00:52:58,376 --> 00:53:01,442
- Turtle pile!
- Wait, wait, wait!

1178
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,455
- Are you funny?
- Where's your shell?

1179
00:53:03,496 --> 00:53:05,470
- I need to breathe!
- Are you running away?

1180
00:53:05,512 --> 00:53:07,105
Did you really cross
the jellyfish forest?

1181
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:09,030
- Did they sting you?
- One at a time!

1182
00:53:09,063 --> 00:53:10,656
Mr. Fish, did you die?

1183
00:53:10,695 --> 00:53:13,117
Sorry, I was
a little vague on the details.

1184
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:14,272
So, where are you going?

1185
00:53:14,312 --> 00:53:16,100
You see, my son was taken.

1186
00:53:16,135 --> 00:53:18,852
My son was taken away from me.

1187
00:53:18,887 --> 00:53:21,059
- No way.
- What happened?

1188
00:53:21,095 --> 00:53:23,168
No, no, kids.
I don't want to talk about it.

1189
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:25,444
Aww! Please?

1190
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:26,756
Please?

1191
00:53:26,792 --> 00:53:29,416
Well, OK.

1192
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:33,093
I live on this reef
a long, long way from here.

1193
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:35,069
This is gonna be good.
I can tell.

1194
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:37,413
And my son Nemo...

1195
00:53:37,448 --> 00:53:39,335
See, he was mad at me.

1196
00:53:39,368 --> 00:53:40,928
And maybe he wouldn't
have done it...

1197
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:42,396
if I hadn't been so tough on him.

1198
00:53:42,439 --> 00:53:43,617
I don't know.

1199
00:53:43,655 --> 00:53:45,565
Anyway, he swam out in
the open water to this boat...

1200
00:53:45,607 --> 00:53:48,357
and when he was out there,
these divers appeared...

1201
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:50,911
and I tried to stop them,
but the boat was too fast.

1202
00:53:50,951 --> 00:53:52,642
So, we swam out in the ocean
to follow them...

1203
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:54,915
They couldn't stop 'em.
And then Nemo's dad...

1204
00:53:54,951 --> 00:53:57,602
he swims out to the ocean,
and they bump into...

1205
00:53:57,639 --> 00:53:58,883
...three ferocious sharks.

1206
00:53:58,919 --> 00:54:00,927
He scares away the sharks
by blowing 'em up!

1207
00:54:00,967 --> 00:54:02,243
Golly, that's amazing.

1208
00:54:02,279 --> 00:54:03,839
And then dives
thousands of feet...

1209
00:54:03,879 --> 00:54:05,538
...straight down into the dark.

1210
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:06,982
lt's wicked dark down there.

1211
00:54:07,015 --> 00:54:08,640
You can't see a thing.
How's it going, Bob?

1212
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,272
And the only thing
they can see down there...

1213
00:54:10,311 --> 00:54:11,969
...is the light from
this big, horrible creature...

1214
00:54:12,007 --> 00:54:13,895
with razor-sharp teeth.
Nice parry, old man.

1215
00:54:13,927 --> 00:54:15,236
And then he has to blast his way...

1216
00:54:15,271 --> 00:54:16,831
So, these two little fish have been...

1217
00:54:16,871 --> 00:54:20,263
searching the ocean for days
on the East Australian Current.

1218
00:54:20,263 --> 00:54:22,499
Which means that he may be
on his way here right now.

1219
00:54:22,535 --> 00:54:23,996
That should put him in Sydney Harbor...

1220
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:25,283
...in a matter of days.
I mean, it sounds like...

1221
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:27,228
this guy is gonna stop at nothing...

1222
00:54:27,271 --> 00:54:29,922
...tilI he finds his son.
I sure hope he makes it.

1223
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:32,828
That's one dedicated father,
if you ask me.

1224
00:54:38,215 --> 00:54:40,070
Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1225
00:54:40,103 --> 00:54:45,188
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1226
00:54:45,222 --> 00:54:46,848
Mine! Mine! Mine!
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1227
00:54:46,886 --> 00:54:50,148
Would you just shut up?!

1228
00:54:50,183 --> 00:54:51,589
You're rats with wings!

1229
00:54:51,623 --> 00:54:53,052
Bloke's been looking
for his boy Nemo.

1230
00:54:53,094 --> 00:54:55,331
- Nemo?!
- He was taken off the reef...

1231
00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:00,994
-Take it! You happy?
-Mine! Mine! Mine!

1232
00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:00,994
Hey, say that again!
Something about Nemo.

1233
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:02,143
Mine! Mine! Mine!

1234
00:55:02,183 --> 00:55:03,612
Whoooa....

1235
00:55:03,654 --> 00:55:04,767
Hyah!

1236
00:55:04,807 --> 00:55:06,301
Mine?

1237
00:55:06,342 --> 00:55:08,481
Last I heard, he's heading
towards the harbor.

1238
00:55:08,518 --> 00:55:10,853
Ho ho! Brilliant!

1239
00:55:23,207 --> 00:55:24,646
ls he doing OK?

1240
00:55:24,646 --> 00:55:25,148
ls he doing OK?

1241
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:28,256
Whatever you do, don't mention D-a-r--

1242
00:55:28,295 --> 00:55:31,044
lt's OK. I know who
you're talking about.

1243
00:55:38,726 --> 00:55:40,002
Gill?

1244
00:55:42,374 --> 00:55:44,032
Gill?

1245
00:55:44,071 --> 00:55:46,624
Hey, Sharkbait.

1246
00:55:46,662 --> 00:55:48,801
l'm sorry I couldn't stop the--

1247
00:55:48,838 --> 00:55:50,910
No, l'm the one who should be sorry.

1248
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:53,470
I was so ready to get out...

1249
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:56,161
so ready to taste that ocean...

1250
00:55:56,199 --> 00:55:59,494
I was willing to put you
in harm's way to get there.

1251
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:03,323
Nothing should be worth that.

1252
00:56:03,366 --> 00:56:06,465
l'm sorry I couldn't get you
back to your father, kid.

1253
00:56:10,022 --> 00:56:12,804
AlI right.
Hey, hey, hey--

1254
00:56:12,838 --> 00:56:14,398
-What the--
-Aaah!

1255
00:56:14,438 --> 00:56:18,017
That's one way to pulI a tooth.

1256
00:56:18,054 --> 00:56:20,061
Huh. Darn kids.

1257
00:56:20,102 --> 00:56:22,971
Good thing I pulled the
right one, eh, Prime Minister?

1258
00:56:23,014 --> 00:56:34,099
NlGEL: Hey, psst!

1259
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,459
Oh, Nigel!
You just missed an extraction.

1260
00:56:26,502 --> 00:56:29,022
Has he loosened
the periodontaI ligament yet?

1261
00:56:29,062 --> 00:56:31,036
What am I talking about?
Where's Nemo?

1262
00:56:31,142 --> 00:56:33,313
- l've got to speak with him.
- What is it?

1263
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:35,357
Your dad's been fighting
the entire ocean...

1264
00:56:35,398 --> 00:56:37,918
- Looking for you.
- My father? Really?

1265
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:41,919
He's traveled hundreds of miles,
battling sharks and jellyfish--

1266
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:44,347
Sharks? That can't be him.

1267
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:46,878
What was his name?
Some sort of sport fish.

1268
00:56:46,918 --> 00:56:48,991
- Tuna? Trout?
- Marlin?

1269
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,786
Marlin! The little clownfish
from the reef.

1270
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:53,309
lt's my dad!
He took on a shark!

1271
00:56:53,349 --> 00:56:55,586
I heard he took on three.

1272
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:58,338
-Three sharks?
-That's 4,800 teeth!

1273
00:56:58,374 --> 00:57:00,381
After you were taken
by Diver Dan over there...

1274
00:57:00,421 --> 00:57:02,560
your dad followed the boat
like a maniac.

1275
00:57:02,597 --> 00:57:03,906
Really?

1276
00:57:03,942 --> 00:57:05,665
He's swimming,
giving it alI he's got...

1277
00:57:05,702 --> 00:57:07,676
and then three gigantic
sharks capture him...

1278
00:57:07,718 --> 00:57:09,889
and he blows them up
and dives thousands of feet...

1279
00:57:09,925 --> 00:57:12,642
and gets chased by a monster
with huge teeth!

1280
00:57:12,678 --> 00:57:15,198
He ties this demon to a rock,
and what's his reward?

1281
00:57:15,237 --> 00:57:17,506
He gets to battle
an entire jellyfish forest!

1282
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:20,608
Now he's with a bunch of
sea turtles on the E.A.C...

1283
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:23,994
and the word is he's headed
this way right now...to Sydney!

1284
00:57:24,037 --> 00:57:25,347
-Wow!
-What a good daddy!

1285
00:57:25,381 --> 00:57:27,836
He was looking for you
after all, Sharkbait.

1286
00:57:31,205 --> 00:57:32,766
He's swimming to the filter!

1287
00:57:32,806 --> 00:57:34,235
- Sharkbait!
- Not again!

1288
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:38,532
Sharkbait!

1289
00:57:38,566 --> 00:57:39,875
No!

1290
00:57:39,909 --> 00:57:41,055
You got your whole life ahead of you!

1291
00:57:41,093 --> 00:57:43,395
- We'lI help you, kid!
- Get him out!

1292
00:57:47,525 --> 00:57:49,118
Get him out of there!

1293
00:57:49,157 --> 00:57:50,718
Come on, kid!
Grab the end!

1294
00:57:50,757 --> 00:57:53,245
Sharkbait!

1295
00:57:53,285 --> 00:57:55,227
- No!
- Can you hear me?

1296
00:57:55,269 --> 00:57:56,698
Nemo! Can you hear me?

1297
00:57:56,741 --> 00:57:58,684
Yeah, I can hear you.

1298
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:00,580
Sharkbait, you did it!

1299
00:58:00,613 --> 00:58:04,257
Sharkbait, you're...
covered with germs! Aah!

1300
00:58:04,293 --> 00:58:06,277
Ha ha!
That took guts, kid.

1301
00:58:06,277 --> 00:58:08,666
AlI right, gang,
we have less than 48 hours...

1302
00:58:08,709 --> 00:58:09,953
before Darla gets here.

1303
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,615
This tank'lI get
plenty dirty in that time...

1304
00:58:11,653 --> 00:58:14,370
but we have to help it along
any way we can.

1305
00:58:14,405 --> 00:58:16,576
-Jacques? No cleaning.
-I shalI resist.

1306
00:58:16,613 --> 00:58:19,166
Everybody else,
be as gross as possible.

1307
00:58:19,205 --> 00:58:20,383
Think dirty thoughts.

1308
00:58:20,421 --> 00:58:22,526
We're gonna make
this tank so filthy...

1309
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:24,987
the dentist
wilI have to clean it.

1310
00:58:25,029 --> 00:58:27,036
- Good work!
- Ha ha ha!

1311
00:58:33,317 --> 00:58:35,739
AlI right, we're here, dudes!

1312
00:58:35,781 --> 00:58:38,847
Get ready!
Your exit's coming up, man!

1313
00:58:38,885 --> 00:58:40,314
Where? I don't see it!

1314
00:58:40,357 --> 00:58:42,692
Right there!
I see it! I see it!

1315
00:58:42,725 --> 00:58:45,725
The swirling vortex of terror?

1316
00:58:45,765 --> 00:58:47,969
- That's it, dude.
- Of course it is.

1317
00:58:48,005 --> 00:58:51,867
OK, first,
find your exit buddy.

1318
00:58:51,909 --> 00:58:54,298
Do you have your exit buddy?

1319
00:58:54,341 --> 00:58:55,519
Yes!

1320
00:58:55,557 --> 00:59:00,096
Squirt give you a rundown
of proper exiting technique.

1321
00:59:00,133 --> 00:59:03,515
Good afternoon!
We'lI have a great jump today!

1322
00:59:03,556 --> 00:59:07,102
OK, crank a hard cutback
as you hit the wall.

1323
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,955
There's a screaming bottom turn,
so watch out!

1324
00:59:09,989 --> 00:59:13,120
Remember, rip it, rolI it, and punch it!

1325
00:59:13,156 --> 00:59:16,156
He's trying to speak to me, I know it!

1326
00:59:16,196 --> 00:59:19,295
You're really cute, but I don't
know what you're saying!

1327
00:59:19,332 --> 00:59:20,543
Say the first thing again.

1328
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,002
OK, Jellyman! Go, go, go!

1329
00:59:28,037 --> 00:59:31,419
- Whoa!
- Wahoo!

1330
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:33,435
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1331
00:59:35,396 --> 00:59:36,738
Whoo!

1332
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:39,260
That was...fun!

1333
00:59:39,301 --> 00:59:41,472
I actually enjoyed that.

1334
00:59:41,508 --> 00:59:43,069
Hey, look, turtles!

1335
00:59:43,109 --> 00:59:45,924
Ha ha!
Most excellent!

1336
00:59:45,956 --> 00:59:47,647
Now turn your fishy tails around...

1337
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:50,750
and swim straight on
through to Sydney!

1338
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:52,861
No worries, man!

1339
00:59:52,901 --> 00:59:54,875
No worries!
Thank you, dude Crush!

1340
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:57,372
- Bye!
- Bye, Jellyman!

1341
00:59:57,412 --> 00:59:59,616
You telI your little dude
I said hi, OK?

1342
00:59:59,652 --> 01:00:00,765
See ya later, dudes!

1343
01:00:00,804 --> 01:00:02,462
Bye, everyone!

1344
01:00:02,501 --> 01:00:04,737
Nemo would have loved this.

1345
01:00:04,772 --> 01:00:07,969
Ooh! Hey! Crush, I forgot!

1346
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:09,499
How old are you?

1347
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:13,566
150, dude!
And stilI young! Rock on!

1348
01:00:13,604 --> 01:00:17,466
150! 150! I gotta remember that.

1349
01:00:17,508 --> 01:00:18,654
Whoa.

1350
01:00:23,268 --> 01:00:25,789
- We going in there?
- Yep.

1351
01:00:25,828 --> 01:00:27,803
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

1352
01:00:27,844 --> 01:00:33,245
Yep. We're gonna
just swim straight.

1353
01:00:33,285 --> 01:00:35,935
Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming

1354
01:00:35,972 --> 01:00:37,084
Dory...

1355
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:48,029
Boy, this is taking awhile.

1356
01:00:48,068 --> 01:00:49,694
How about we play a game?

1357
01:00:49,732 --> 01:00:50,942
OK.

1358
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,914
OK, l'm thinking
of something orange...

1359
01:00:53,956 --> 01:00:55,384
and it's small--

1360
01:00:55,428 --> 01:00:57,632
- lt's me.
- Right!

1361
01:00:57,668 --> 01:01:01,083
lt's orange and small--

1362
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:02,368
lt's me.

1363
01:01:02,404 --> 01:01:04,226
AlI righty,
Mr. Smartypants.

1364
01:01:04,259 --> 01:01:05,092
And it's orange and small
and white stripes--

1365
01:01:05,092 --> 01:01:07,296
And it's orange and small
and white stripes--

1366
01:01:07,332 --> 01:01:09,471
Me. And the next one,
just a guess, me.

1367
01:01:09,508 --> 01:01:11,930
- That's just scary.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1368
01:01:11,972 --> 01:01:13,728
I have definitely seen
this floating speck before.

1369
01:01:13,763 --> 01:01:15,225
That means we've passed it before...

1370
01:01:15,268 --> 01:01:16,577
and that means we're going in circles...

1371
01:01:16,612 --> 01:01:18,106
and that means we're not going straight!

1372
01:01:18,211 --> 01:01:20,219
- Hey, hey!
- Get to the surface.

1373
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,787
We'lI figure it out
up there. Let's go!

1374
01:01:21,828 --> 01:01:23,933
- Hey! Relax.
- What?

1375
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:26,459
Take a deep breath.

1376
01:01:28,323 --> 01:01:28,804
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

1377
01:01:28,804 --> 01:01:30,527
Now, let's ask somebody
for directions.

1378
01:01:30,564 --> 01:01:32,506
Fine. Who do you
want to ask, the speck?

1379
01:01:32,548 --> 01:01:34,817
- There's nobody here!
- There has to be someone.

1380
01:01:34,852 --> 01:01:37,601
lt's the ocean, silly.
We're not the only two in here.

1381
01:01:37,636 --> 01:01:39,872
Let's see. OK, no one there.

1382
01:01:39,908 --> 01:01:44,185
Nope. Nada.

1383
01:01:45,539 --> 01:01:47,262
There's somebody.
Hey! Excuse--

1384
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,056
Dory, Dory, Dory!
Now it's my turn.

1385
01:01:49,091 --> 01:01:50,618
l'm thinking of something
dark and mysterious.

1386
01:01:50,659 --> 01:01:52,928
lt's a fish we don't know.
lf we ask it directions...

1387
01:01:52,964 --> 01:01:54,906
it could ingest us
and spit out our bones!

1388
01:01:54,947 --> 01:01:57,314
What is it with men
and asking for directions?

1389
01:01:57,348 --> 01:01:59,071
I don't want to play
the gender card right now.

1390
01:01:59,107 --> 01:02:00,962
Let's play the ''Let's Not Die'' card.

1391
01:02:00,996 --> 01:02:02,818
- You want to get out of here?
- Of course I do.

1392
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:05,983
How are we gonna do that
unless we give it a shot?

1393
01:02:06,019 --> 01:02:07,929
Dory, you don't fully understand--

1394
01:02:07,971 --> 01:02:09,880
Come on. Trust me on this.

1395
01:02:17,635 --> 01:02:21,315
AlI right.

1396
01:02:21,315 --> 01:02:24,446
Excuse me! Whoo-hoo!
Little fella?

1397
01:02:24,484 --> 01:02:27,203
Hello!
Don't be rude. Say hi.

1398
01:02:27,203 --> 01:02:28,251
Hello!
Don't be rude. Say hi.

1399
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:30,233
Ha. Hello.

1400
01:02:30,275 --> 01:02:31,737
- His son Bingo--
- Nemo.

1401
01:02:31,779 --> 01:02:34,681
- Nemo was taken to--
- Sydney.

1402
01:02:34,723 --> 01:02:37,789
Sydney! And it's
really, really important...

1403
01:02:37,828 --> 01:02:39,682
that we get there
as fast as we can...

1404
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:41,722
so can you help us out?

1405
01:02:41,763 --> 01:02:45,146
Come on, little fella.
Come on.

1406
01:02:45,187 --> 01:02:48,286
Dory, l'm a little fella.

1407
01:02:48,323 --> 01:02:51,683
I don't think that's a little fella.

1408
01:02:51,683 --> 01:02:55,425
Oh! Big fella.
Whale. OK.

1409
01:02:55,459 --> 01:02:57,826
Maybe he only speaks whale.

1410
01:02:57,859 --> 01:03:00,957
Mooo! Weee neeed...

1411
01:03:00,995 --> 01:03:04,923
-Dory?
-Tooo fiind his son.

1412
01:03:04,963 --> 01:03:07,516
What are you doing?
Are you sure you speak whale?

1413
01:03:07,555 --> 01:03:08,771
Can youuuu give us
diiirectionsss?

1414
01:03:08,771 --> 01:03:10,811
Can youuuu give us
diiirectionsss?

1415
01:03:10,851 --> 01:03:13,087
Dory! Heaven knows
what you're saying!

1416
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:16,571
- See, he's swimming away.
- Cooome baaack.

1417
01:03:16,611 --> 01:03:18,782
He's not coming back.
You offended him.

1418
01:03:18,819 --> 01:03:19,964
- Maybe a different dialect.

1419
01:03:20,003 --> 01:03:23,069
- Moooohhhmmooo...
- Dory!

1420
01:03:23,106 --> 01:03:26,238
This is not whale.
You're speaking upset stomach.

1421
01:03:26,275 --> 01:03:26,563
- Maybe I should try humpback.
- Don't.

1422
01:03:26,563 --> 01:03:28,385
- Maybe I should try humpback.
- Don't.

1423
01:03:28,418 --> 01:03:29,825
Wooooooo...

1424
01:03:29,859 --> 01:03:32,706
- You actually sound sick.
- Maybe louder?

1425
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:34,146
- Rah! Rah!
- Don't do that!

1426
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:35,837
Too much orca.
Didn't it sound orca-ish?

1427
01:03:35,875 --> 01:03:37,151
lt doesn't sound orca.

1428
01:03:37,187 --> 01:03:38,910
lt sounds like nothing
l've ever heard.

1429
01:03:38,947 --> 01:03:41,336
- Oooooo!
- Ohh!

1430
01:03:41,379 --> 01:03:41,923
lt's just as well.
He might be hungry.

1431
01:03:41,923 --> 01:03:43,232
lt's just as well.
He might be hungry.

1432
01:03:43,266 --> 01:03:46,136
Whales don't eat clownfish.
They eat krill.

1433
01:03:46,179 --> 01:03:49,561
- Swim away!
- Oh, look, krill!

1434
01:03:50,915 --> 01:03:53,763
Move, Dory, move!

1435
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:54,297
Move, Dory, move!

1436
01:03:54,338 --> 01:03:56,313
- Aah!
- Aah!

1437
01:04:00,098 --> 01:04:02,749
Look at that.
Would you look at that?

1438
01:04:02,786 --> 01:04:06,583
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.

1439
01:04:06,626 --> 01:04:09,496
AlI thanks to you, kid.
You made it possible.

1440
01:04:09,538 --> 01:04:11,480
Jacques,
I said no cleaning.

1441
01:04:11,586 --> 01:04:13,277
I am ashamed.

1442
01:04:13,315 --> 01:04:15,682
Look! Scum angel!

1443
01:04:17,826 --> 01:04:19,681
Ooh! Aaah!

1444
01:04:19,714 --> 01:04:21,569
Bubbles!
I love the bubbles!

1445
01:04:23,554 --> 01:04:27,035
Flo? Has anybody seen Flo?

1446
01:04:27,074 --> 01:04:29,594
9:00 and cue dentist.

1447
01:04:29,635 --> 01:04:31,806
Hello, Barbara.
Sorry l'm late.

1448
01:04:31,842 --> 01:04:34,428
OK, here we go.
Here we go, OK.

1449
01:04:34,466 --> 01:04:36,124
Little Davey Reynolds...

1450
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:37,689
Walks to the counter,
drops the keys...

1451
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:39,737
Bloat, that's disgusting!

1452
01:04:39,778 --> 01:04:41,720
Tastes pretty good to me.

1453
01:04:41,762 --> 01:04:43,453
- Urrrp!
- Eww!

1454
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:46,239
Don't you people realize
we are swimming in our own--

1455
01:04:46,274 --> 01:04:47,321
Shh! Here he comes!

1456
01:04:47,362 --> 01:04:49,250
Aah!

1457
01:04:49,282 --> 01:04:52,446
Crikey. What a state.

1458
01:04:53,858 --> 01:04:57,819
Ohh. Barbara, what's my earliest
appointment tomorrow?

1459
01:04:57,858 --> 01:05:00,673
- 10:00, luv.
- Leave it open, would you?

1460
01:05:00,706 --> 01:05:02,943
l've gotta clean the fish tank
before Darla gets here.

1461
01:05:02,978 --> 01:05:04,985
Did you hear that, Sharkbait?

1462
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:08,571
Yay!
He's gonna clean the tank!

1463
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:10,300
We're gonna be clean!

1464
01:05:10,338 --> 01:05:11,931
You ready to see your dad, kid?

1465
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:13,825
- Uh-huh.
- Of course you are.

1466
01:05:13,857 --> 01:05:16,378
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's out there...

1467
01:05:16,418 --> 01:05:16,962
in the harbor
waiting for you right now.

1468
01:05:16,962 --> 01:05:19,515
in the harbor
waiting for you right now.

1469
01:05:19,554 --> 01:05:21,823
Yeah.

1470
01:06:19,419 --> 01:06:22,419
Aaah!

1471
01:06:22,459 --> 01:06:25,176
Oof!

1472
01:06:30,139 --> 01:06:31,568
Whoo!

1473
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:33,715
Yaahhh!

1474
01:06:33,755 --> 01:06:35,413
Here comes the big one.

1475
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,872
Ooh! Come on!
You gotta try this!

1476
01:06:37,915 --> 01:06:41,046
- WilI you just stop it?
- Why? What's wrong?

1477
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:43,286
We're in a whale,
don't you get it?

1478
01:06:43,323 --> 01:06:44,435
- Whale?
- A whale!

1479
01:06:44,475 --> 01:06:47,093
You had to ask for help!
And now we're stuck here!

1480
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:49,781
Wow, a whale.
I speak whale.

1481
01:06:49,818 --> 01:06:52,055
No, you're insane!
You can't speak whale!

1482
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:55,156
I have to get out!
I have to find my son!

1483
01:06:55,195 --> 01:07:00,377
I have to telI him
how old sea turtles are!

1484
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:05,367
Ohhh!

1485
01:07:06,715 --> 01:07:09,235
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1486
01:07:10,938 --> 01:07:13,655
Hey...

1487
01:07:13,691 --> 01:07:15,862
you OK?

1488
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:24,559
There, there. lt's alI right.

1489
01:07:24,603 --> 01:07:26,457
lt'lI be OK.

1490
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:28,629
No. No, it won't.

1491
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:30,805
Sure it will. You'lI see.

1492
01:07:30,842 --> 01:07:36,723
No. I promised him l'd never
let anything happen to him.

1493
01:07:36,762 --> 01:07:40,024
Huh. That's a funny thing
to promise.

1494
01:07:40,058 --> 01:07:41,367
What?

1495
01:07:41,402 --> 01:07:43,736
You can't never let
anything happen to him.

1496
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:46,104
Then nothing
would ever happen to him.

1497
01:07:49,018 --> 01:07:51,668
Not much fun for little Harpo.

1498
01:08:00,154 --> 01:08:01,910
-Hmm.
-What's going on?

1499
01:08:01,946 --> 01:08:04,150
Don't know. l'lI ask him.

1500
01:08:06,586 --> 01:08:12,369
- Dory...
- Whaaat's goooing onnn?

1501
01:08:18,169 --> 01:08:19,696
I think he says we've stopped.

1502
01:08:19,737 --> 01:08:22,869
Of course we've stopped.
Stop trying to speak whale.

1503
01:08:22,906 --> 01:08:25,589
You'lI make things worse.
What is that noise?

1504
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:32,213
Oh, no. Look what you did.

1505
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:37,007
The water's going down.
lt's going down!

1506
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:41,944
Really? You sure about that?

1507
01:08:41,977 --> 01:08:43,952
Look!
Already it's half empty!

1508
01:08:43,993 --> 01:08:45,684
l'd say it's half full.

1509
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:47,128
Stop that! lt's half empty!

1510
01:08:50,074 --> 01:08:53,140
OK, that one
was a little tougher.

1511
01:08:53,178 --> 01:08:55,642
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat...

1512
01:08:55,642 --> 01:08:55,957
He either said we should go
to the back of the throat...

1513
01:08:55,994 --> 01:08:58,066
or he wants a root beer float.

1514
01:08:58,105 --> 01:08:59,666
Of course he wants us
to go there!

1515
01:08:59,705 --> 01:09:01,560
That's eating us!

1516
01:09:01,593 --> 01:09:04,441
How do I taste, Moby?
Do I taste good?

1517
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,645
TelI him l'm not interested
in being lunch!

1518
01:09:06,681 --> 01:09:09,048
- OK. Heee--
- Stop talking to him!

1519
01:09:12,218 --> 01:09:14,935
- Aah!
- Aah!

1520
01:09:14,969 --> 01:09:16,082
What is going on?

1521
01:09:16,122 --> 01:09:18,326
l'lI check. Whaaat--

1522
01:09:18,361 --> 01:09:21,012
No more whale!
You can't speak whale!

1523
01:09:21,049 --> 01:09:23,286
- Yes, I can!
- No, you can't!

1524
01:09:23,321 --> 01:09:26,736
You think you can do these
things, but you can't, Nemo!

1525
01:09:31,545 --> 01:09:34,262
- OK.
- Dory! Oof!

1526
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:40,177
He says it's time to let go.

1527
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:42,105
Everything's gonna be
alI right.

1528
01:09:42,138 --> 01:09:43,731
How do you know?

1529
01:09:43,769 --> 01:09:46,736
How do you know something bad
isn't gonna happen?

1530
01:09:46,777 --> 01:09:48,600
I don't!

1531
01:10:00,313 --> 01:10:03,481
-Aah!
-Aah!

1532
01:10:03,481 --> 01:10:04,342
- Aah!
- Aah!

1533
01:10:04,377 --> 01:10:06,067
- Aah!
- Aah!

1534
01:10:08,377 --> 01:10:12,948
Ha ha ha!
We're alive!

1535
01:10:13,977 --> 01:10:16,726
Look! Sy-d-ney--Sydney!

1536
01:10:16,761 --> 01:10:19,095
Sydney! Sydney again!

1537
01:10:21,017 --> 01:10:23,384
You were right, Dory!
We made it!

1538
01:10:23,417 --> 01:10:26,232
We're gonna find my son!

1539
01:10:28,697 --> 01:10:29,113
Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr!

1540
01:10:29,113 --> 01:10:32,048
Thaaank yoouuu, sirrr!

1541
01:10:32,089 --> 01:10:34,456
Wow. I wish
I could speak whale.

1542
01:10:34,488 --> 01:10:36,692
AlI we gotta do is find
the boat that took him.

1543
01:10:36,729 --> 01:10:39,696
- Right!
- We can do this!

1544
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:58,132
lt's morning, everyone!
Today's the day!

1545
01:10:58,169 --> 01:11:00,241
The sun is shining,
the tank is clean...

1546
01:11:00,281 --> 01:11:03,215
and we are getting out--
The tank is clean.

1547
01:11:03,256 --> 01:11:05,712
The tank is clean!

1548
01:11:05,753 --> 01:11:07,280
But how?

1549
01:11:07,321 --> 01:11:09,906
Boss must've installed it
while we were sleeping.

1550
01:11:09,945 --> 01:11:13,261
- What are we gonna do?
- What's it say, Peach?

1551
01:11:14,585 --> 01:11:15,861
I can't hear you, Peach.

1552
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:18,231
The Aquascum 2003 is
an all-purpose, self-cleaning...

1553
01:11:18,264 --> 01:11:20,152
maintenance-free,
salt water purifier...

1554
01:11:20,184 --> 01:11:23,054
that is guaranteed to extend
the life of your aquarium fish.

1555
01:11:23,096 --> 01:11:24,274
Stop it!

1556
01:11:24,312 --> 01:11:25,741
The Aquascum
is programmed to scan...

1557
01:11:25,784 --> 01:11:27,988
your tank environment
every five minutes?!

1558
01:11:28,024 --> 01:11:29,650
Scan? What does that mean?

1559
01:11:31,225 --> 01:11:32,981
Aah!

1560
01:11:35,287 --> 01:11:35,672
AQUASCUM:
Temperature--82 degrees...

1561
01:11:35,672 --> 01:11:36,784
AQUASCUM:
Temperature--82 degrees...

1562
01:11:35,865 --> 01:11:37,458
PH balance--normal.

1563
01:11:37,496 --> 01:11:39,798
- Ooh.
- Nice.

1564
01:11:39,832 --> 01:11:44,207
Ooh--Oh!
Curse you, Aquascum!

1565
01:11:44,248 --> 01:11:46,256
That's it for the escape plan.
lt's ruined.

1566
01:11:46,296 --> 01:11:47,670
Then what are
we gonna do about--

1567
01:11:47,704 --> 01:11:48,153
Darla!

1568
01:11:48,153 --> 01:11:49,614
Darla!

1569
01:11:49,656 --> 01:11:52,144
Stay down, kid!

1570
01:11:52,184 --> 01:11:54,072
- False alarm.
- Whew.

1571
01:11:54,104 --> 01:11:56,112
My nerves can't take
much more of this.

1572
01:11:56,152 --> 01:11:58,291
What'lI we do
when that brat gets here?

1573
01:11:58,328 --> 01:12:00,467
- l'm thinking.
- Oh! Gill!

1574
01:12:00,504 --> 01:12:03,537
- Nemo! l'm coming!
- Help me! Help me!

1575
01:12:03,576 --> 01:12:07,318
Swim down! Come on, kid!

1576
01:12:07,353 --> 01:12:08,781
- Everybody jump in!
- Swim down!

1577
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,068
- That's it!
- What the--?

1578
01:12:10,104 --> 01:12:13,235
-Yay!
-Ha ha! Good work!

1579
01:12:13,272 --> 01:12:14,733
Gill!

1580
01:12:14,776 --> 01:12:16,303

1582
01:12:23,896 --> 01:12:26,230
Whoops.
That would've been a nasty fall.

1583
01:12:26,264 --> 01:12:28,751
Gill!
Don't let me go belly-up!

1584
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:30,996
Just calm down, Nemo.
You won't go belly-up.

1585
01:12:31,032 --> 01:12:33,334
I promise.
You're gonna be OK.

Darla!

1587
01:12:41,463 --> 01:12:45,042
Do any of these boats
look familiar to you?

1588
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,902
No, but the boat
has to be here somewhere.

1589
01:12:46,936 --> 01:12:48,976
Come on, Dory.
We're gonna find it.

1590
01:12:49,016 --> 01:12:51,634

Are you excited?

1591
01:12:51,671 --> 01:12:53,362
Dory, wake up.
Wake up, come on.

1592
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,156
Duck!

1593

1597
01:13:17,751 --> 01:13:20,118
Hey, Nigel.

1598
01:13:20,152 --> 01:13:21,461
What? What?

1599
01:13:21,495 --> 01:13:24,245
Sun's barely up and Gerald's

1600
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:26,800
Yeah. Reckon somebody

ALL: Yeah, right. Yeah.

1602
01:13:28,792 --> 01:13:32,272
Don't everybody

1603
01:13:35,256 --> 01:13:38,070
AlI right, Gerald.
Fish got your tongue?

01:13:42,647 --> 01:13:45,614
Nemo? He's that fish!

1608
01:13:45,655 --> 01:13:48,111
The one that's been fighting

Wait! Come back! Stop!

1611
01:13:53,752 --> 01:13:55,890
Dory, keep going!
He's crazy!

Don't make any sudden moves.

1615
01:14:10,551 --> 01:14:14,642
Hop inside my mouth
if you want to live.

1616
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:18,160
Hop in your mouth?
How does that make me live?

1617
01:14:18,199 --> 01:14:19,312
Mine?

1618
01:14:19,351 --> 01:14:19,671
Because I can take you to your son.

1619
01:14:19,671 --> 01:14:22,835
Because I can take you to your son.

1620
01:14:22,871 --> 01:14:25,424
- Yeah, right.

1621
01:14:25,463 --> 01:14:28,049
He's orange with
a gimpy fin on one side.

1622
01:14:28,087 --> 01:14:29,199

1648
01:15:46,423 --> 01:15:48,365
What's happening?
Why is he playing dead?

1649
01:15:48,406 --> 01:15:50,195
GlLL: He's gonna get flushed
down the toilet.

1650
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:52,532
- He's gonna get out of here!

1651
01:15:52,566 --> 01:15:54,257

if it wasn't for you...

1700
01:18:57,077 --> 01:18:59,760
I never would've even
made it here.

1701
01:18:59,797 --> 01:19:01,707
So, thank you.

1702

Hey, wait a minute.

Wait. Where are you going?

01:19:07,925 --> 01:19:11,340
lt's over, Dory.
We were too late.

1705
01:19:11,381 --> 01:19:15,952
Nemo's gone,

Please?

1710
01:19:26,997 --> 01:19:29,647
No one's ever stuck with me
for so long before.

1711
01:19:29,685 --> 01:19:33,100
And if you leave, I just...

1712

I don't want that to go away.

1721
01:19:58,389 --> 01:20:00,658
I don't want to forget.

1722
01:20:01,941 --> 01:20:05,836

1729
01:20:36,212 --> 01:20:38,351
Gotcha! Hey! Hey!

Are you alI right?

1736
01:21:04,852 --> 01:21:07,372
I don't know where I am.
I don't know what's going on.

1737
01:21:07,412 --> 01:21:10,162
I think I lost somebody,
but I can't remember.

1738
01:21:10,196 --> 01:21:14,124
lt's OK.

1739
01:21:14,164 --> 01:21:16,498

01:21:16,532 --> 01:21:18,768

1741
01:21:18,804 --> 01:21:19,916

1742
01:21:19,956 --> 01:21:23,185
Nemo? That's a nice name.

1743
01:21:31,764 --> 01:21:34,579
-Dad!
-Dad!

1744

- My dad.

1746
01:21:39,028 --> 01:21:41,199
- Where are we, anyway?
- Dad! Dad!

1747
01:21:41,235 --> 01:21:44,978
Oh. Syl--Shi--Sydney.

1748
01:21:45,012 --> 01:21:49,103
P. Sherman,
42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

1749
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:50,831
Aah! Nemo!

1750
01:21:50,868 --> 01:21:53,137
lt's you! Aah!
You're Nemo!

1751
01:21:53,172 --> 01:21:54,764
Yes, yes, l'm Nemo!

1752
01:21:54,804 --> 01:21:57,292
You're Nemo!
You were dead. I saw you.

1753
01:21:57,332 --> 01:21:59,154
And here you are!
I found you.

1754
01:21:59,188 --> 01:22:01,806
You're not dead.
And your father--Your father!

1755
01:22:01,843 --> 01:22:04,112
You know my father?!
Where is he?

1756
01:22:04,148 --> 01:22:06,865
This way!
He went this way. Quick!

1757
01:22:09,652 --> 01:22:11,081
Have you seen
an orange fish swim by?

1758
01:22:11,124 --> 01:22:13,393
- lt looks just like him!
- But bigger!

1759
01:22:13,427 --> 01:22:14,605
Yeah, I saw him, bluey.

1760
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:16,050
But l'm not tellin' you
where he went...

1761
01:22:16,084 --> 01:22:21,396
and there's no way
you're gonna make me.

1762
01:22:21,396 --> 01:22:22,508
Mine.

1763
01:22:22,611 --> 01:22:25,262
Aah!
AlI right! l'lI talk!

1764
01:22:25,299 --> 01:22:31,731
He went to
the fishing grounds! Aah!

1765
01:22:31,731 --> 01:22:33,520
Hey, look out!

1766
01:22:33,555 --> 01:22:35,944
l'm sorry.
l'm just trying to get home.

1767
01:22:36,948 --> 01:22:40,526
Dad! Dad!

1768
01:22:40,563 --> 01:22:41,905
Nemo?

1769
01:22:41,939 --> 01:22:44,306
- Daddy!
- Nemo?

1770
01:22:44,339 --> 01:22:46,035
- Dad!
- Nemo's alive!

1771
01:22:46,035 --> 01:22:46,253
- Dad!
- Nemo's alive!

1772
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:48,201
Dory? Nemo!

1773
01:22:48,243 --> 01:22:49,388
Daddy!

1774
01:22:49,427 --> 01:22:51,631
Nemo! l'm coming, Nemo!

1775
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:55,180
-Dad!
-Nemo! Thank goodness.

1776
01:22:55,219 --> 01:22:58,034
lt's alI right, son.
lt's gonna be OK.

1777
01:22:58,067 --> 01:23:00,819
GROUPER: Turn around!
You're going the wrong way!

1778
01:23:03,219 --> 01:23:04,528
Aah! Look out!

1779
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:26,538
Help! He-e-elp!

1780
01:23:26,579 --> 01:23:28,105

1781
01:23:28,147 --> 01:23:29,488
Help! Help!

1782
01:23:29,523 --> 01:23:32,141
Help! Get us out! Aah!

1783
01:23:32,179 --> 01:23:33,903
No, no, no! Dory!

1784
01:23:33,939 --> 01:23:36,809
- Dad, I know what to do!
- Nemo! No!

1785
01:23:36,851 --> 01:23:39,469
We have to telI alI the fish
to swim down together!

1786
01:23:39,507 --> 01:23:42,093
- Get out of there now!
- I know this wilI work!

1787
01:23:42,131 --> 01:23:43,986
No, I am not
gonna lose you again!

1788
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:47,314
There's no time!
lt's the only way to save Dory!

1789
01:23:48,562 --> 01:23:49,969
I can do this.

1790
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:53,130
You're right.

1791
01:23:53,171 --> 01:23:54,927
I know you can.

1792
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:57,745
- Lucky fin!
- Now, go! Hurry!

1793
01:23:57,779 --> 01:24:00,462
TelI alI the fish to swim down!

1794
01:24:00,499 --> 01:24:03,728
Well? You heard my son!
Come on!

1795
01:24:05,171 --> 01:24:07,691
Dory, you have
to telI everybody to...

1796
01:24:07,731 --> 01:24:09,192
Swim down together!

1797
01:24:09,234 --> 01:24:11,406
Do you understand
what l'm saying to you?

1798
01:24:11,442 --> 01:24:13,613
Swim down!

1799
01:24:17,778 --> 01:24:18,956
Everybody swim down!

1800
01:24:18,995 --> 01:24:21,416
Come on,
you have to swim down!

1801
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:24,044
Down! Swim down!

1802
01:24:26,066 --> 01:24:29,547
Swim down! Swim down!

1803
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:39,248
Don't give up!
Keep swimming!

1804
01:24:39,282 --> 01:24:41,616
Just keep swimming!

1805
01:24:45,683 --> 01:24:47,243
That's it!

1806
01:24:50,066 --> 01:24:51,976
lt's working!

1807
01:24:54,322 --> 01:24:57,224
Keep swimming!
Keep swimming!

1808
01:24:57,267 --> 01:24:59,307
Just keep swimming!
Keep swimming!

1809
01:24:59,346 --> 01:25:00,753
Come on, Dad!

1810
01:25:00,786 --> 01:25:03,175
- You're doing great, son!
- That's my dad.

1811
01:25:03,218 --> 01:25:05,422
Let's get to the bottom!
Keep swimming!

1812
01:25:05,458 --> 01:25:07,879
Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming

1813
01:25:07,922 --> 01:25:10,028
Almost there!
Keep swimming!

1814
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:14,735
Keep swimming!

1815
01:25:16,946 --> 01:25:18,026
Keep swimming!

1816
01:25:28,018 --> 01:25:29,425
- Oof!
- Hey!

1817
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:32,905
- Dory! Where's Nemo?
- There!

1818
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:37,481
Oh, no. Nemo!

1819
01:25:43,186 --> 01:25:45,008
Nemo?

1820
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:48,814
Nemo?

1821
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:52,680
lt's OK. Daddy's here.
Daddy's got you.

1822
01:25:56,945 --> 01:25:58,058
Daddy?

1823
01:25:58,098 --> 01:25:59,560
Oh, thank goodness.

1824
01:25:59,602 --> 01:26:03,147
Dad...I don't hate you.

1825
01:26:03,186 --> 01:26:04,942
Oh, no, no, no.

1826
01:26:04,977 --> 01:26:07,530
l'm so sorry, Nemo.

1827
01:26:16,401 --> 01:26:19,151
- Hey, guess what?
- What?

1828
01:26:19,185 --> 01:26:22,534
Sea turtles--I met one.

1829
01:26:22,578 --> 01:26:26,604
And he was 150 years old.

1830
01:26:26,642 --> 01:26:30,635
- 150?
- Yep.

1831
01:26:30,674 --> 01:26:35,311
Sandy Plankton said
they only live to be 100.

1832
01:26:35,345 --> 01:26:36,839
Sandy Plankton?

1833
01:26:36,882 --> 01:26:38,791
Do you think I would
cross the entire ocean...

1834
01:26:38,833 --> 01:26:40,840
and not know as much
as Sandy Plankton?

1835
01:26:40,882 --> 01:26:43,435
- Ha ha ha!
- He was 150! Not 100!

1836
01:26:43,474 --> 01:26:47,183
Who is this Sandy Plankton
who knows everything?

1837
01:26:48,818 --> 01:26:49,393
Time for school!
Get up! Let's go!

1838
01:26:49,393 --> 01:26:52,262
Time for school!
Get up! Let's go!

1839
01:26:52,306 --> 01:26:55,273
- l'm gonna win!
- No, you're not!

1840
01:26:55,313 --> 01:26:58,925
- I did it!
- Aw, my own son beats me!

1841
01:26:58,961 --> 01:27:01,328
Climb aboard, explorers.

1842
01:27:01,361 --> 01:27:04,361
The sea cucumber looks over
to the mollusk and says...

1843
01:27:04,401 --> 01:27:07,151
''With fronds like these,
who needs anemones?''

1844
01:27:08,786 --> 01:27:10,924
Hello, Nemo. Who's this?

1845
01:27:11,025 --> 01:27:14,341
- Exchange student.
- l'm from the E.A.C., dude!

1846
01:27:14,385 --> 01:27:16,906
- Sweet!
- Totally.

1847
01:27:16,945 --> 01:27:18,833
Seriously, Marty.

1848
01:27:18,865 --> 01:27:20,752
Did you really do all
the things you say you did?

1849
01:27:20,785 --> 01:27:22,411
Pardon me.

1850
01:27:22,449 --> 01:27:25,035
- Hello.
- Ohh.

1851
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,666
Don't be alarmed.

1852
01:27:26,705 --> 01:27:30,317
We wanted to make sure our
newest member got home safely.

1853
01:27:30,353 --> 01:27:32,590
- Thanks, guys.
- See you next week.

1854
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:35,942
- Keep up with the program.
- Remember, fish are friends...

1855
01:27:35,985 --> 01:27:38,254
Not food! Bye!

1856
01:27:38,289 --> 01:27:40,078
Hold on, here we go!

1857
01:27:40,113 --> 01:27:41,739
Next stop--knowledge!

1858
01:27:41,777 --> 01:27:44,144
Bye, son! Have fun!

1859
01:27:44,177 --> 01:27:45,424
Bye, Dad!

1860
01:27:45,457 --> 01:27:48,752
Oh! Mr. Ray, wait.
I forgot something.

1861
01:27:53,233 --> 01:27:55,753
Love you, Dad.

1862
01:27:55,793 --> 01:27:57,702
I love you, too, son.

1863
01:27:59,889 --> 01:28:03,150
Dad? You can let go now.

1864
01:28:03,185 --> 01:28:06,763
Sorry. Go have an adventure.

1865
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,939
Good-bye!
See ya later, dudes!

1866
01:28:09,041 --> 01:28:11,375
- Bye, Elmo!
- Nemo.

1867
01:28:11,409 --> 01:28:14,725
- Bye, Nemo!
- See you after school, Dory!

1868
01:28:14,769 --> 01:28:15,153
Bye, Dad!

1869
01:28:15,153 --> 01:28:17,520
Bye, Dad!

1870
01:28:17,553 --> 01:28:19,560
Bye, son.

1871
01:28:26,889 --> 01:28:29,758
Barbara,
I don't understand it.

1872
01:28:29,801 --> 01:28:32,070
Here this thing has
a lifetime guarantee...

1873
01:28:32,104 --> 01:28:33,282
and it breaks!

1874
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:35,524
I had to clean the tank myself,
take alI the fish out...

1875
01:28:35,561 --> 01:28:37,830
put 'em in bags, and--

1876
01:28:37,864 --> 01:28:40,253
Where'd the fish go?

1877
01:28:44,864 --> 01:28:47,253
- Come on, Peach!
- Hurry!

1878
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:49,106
- You can do it!
- That's it.

1879
01:28:49,142 --> 01:28:50,517
Just a little further.

1880
01:28:50,550 --> 01:28:52,689
That's the shortest
red light l've ever seen!

1881
01:28:52,726 --> 01:28:54,865
- Come on, Peach!
- Ohh. Aah!

1882
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:05,553
Now what?

1883
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:15,750
Somewhere

1884
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:17,863
Beyond the sea

1885
01:29:17,902 --> 01:29:22,823
Somewhere, waitin' for me

1886
01:29:22,862 --> 01:29:27,597
My lover stands on golden sands

1887
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:29,932
And watches the ships

1888
01:29:29,967 --> 01:29:33,829
That go sailin

1889
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:36,685
Somewhere

1890
01:29:36,718 --> 01:29:38,955
Beyond the sea

1891
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:43,878
She's there
watchin' for me

1892
01:29:43,918 --> 01:29:48,555
lf I could fly
like birds on high

1893
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:51,176
Then straight
to her arms

1894
01:29:51,214 --> 01:29:54,727
l'lI go sailin'

1895
01:29:54,766 --> 01:29:57,701
lt's far

1896
01:29:57,742 --> 01:30:57,837
Beyond the stars

1897
01:30:05,070 --> 01:30:08,365
