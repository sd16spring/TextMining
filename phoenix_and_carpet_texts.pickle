THE EGG\r\n\r\n\r\nIt began with the day when it was almost the Fifth of November, and a\r\ndoubt arose in some breast--Robert\'s, I fancy--as to the quality of the\r\nfireworks laid in for the Guy Fawkes celebration.\r\n\r\n\'They were jolly cheap,\' said whoever it was, and I think it was Robert,\r\n\'and suppose they didn\'t go off on the night? Those Prosser kids would\r\nhave something to snigger about then.\'\r\n\r\n\'The ones _I_ got are all right,\' Jane said; \'I know they are, because\r\nthe man at the shop said they were worth thribble the money--\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure thribble isn\'t grammar,\' Anthea said.\r\n\r\n\'Of course it isn\'t,\' said Cyril; \'one word can\'t be grammar all by\r\nitself, so you needn\'t be so jolly clever.\'\r\n\r\nAnthea was rummaging in the corner-drawers of her mind for a very\r\ndisagreeable answer, when she remembered what a wet day it was, and how\r\nthe boys had been disappointed of that ride to London and back on the\r\ntop of the tram, which their mother had promised them as a reward for\r\nnot having once forgotten, for six whole days, to wipe their boots on\r\nthe mat when they came home from school.\r\n\r\nSo Anthea only said, \'Don\'t be so jolly clever yourself, Squirrel. And\r\nthe fireworks look all right, and you\'ll have the eightpence that your\r\ntram fares didn\'t cost to-day, to buy something more with. You ought to\r\nget a perfectly lovely Catharine wheel for eightpence.\'\r\n\r\n\'I daresay,\' said Cyril, coldly; \'but it\'s not YOUR eightpence anyhow--\'\r\n\r\n\'But look here,\' said Robert, \'really now, about the fireworks. We don\'t\r\nwant to be disgraced before those kids next door. They think because\r\nthey wear red plush on Sundays no one else is any good.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wouldn\'t wear plush if it was ever so--unless it was black to be\r\nbeheaded in, if I was Mary Queen of Scots,\' said Anthea, with scorn.\r\n\r\nRobert stuck steadily to his point. One great point about Robert is the\r\nsteadiness with which he can stick.\r\n\r\n\'I think we ought to test them,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'You young duffer,\' said Cyril, \'fireworks are like postage-stamps. You\r\ncan only use them once.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you suppose it means by "Carter\'s tested seeds" in the\r\nadvertisement?\'\r\n\r\nThere was a blank silence. Then Cyril touched his forehead with his\r\nfinger and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\'A little wrong here,\' he said. \'I was always afraid of that with poor\r\nRobert. All that cleverness, you know, and being top in algebra so\r\noften--it\'s bound to tell--\'\r\n\r\n\'Dry up,\' said Robert, fiercely. \'Don\'t you see? You can\'t TEST seeds if\r\nyou do them ALL. You just take a few here and there, and if those\r\ngrow you can feel pretty sure the others will be--what do you call\r\nit?--Father told me--"up to sample". Don\'t you think we ought to sample\r\nthe fire-works? Just shut our eyes and each draw one out, and then try\r\nthem.\'\r\n\r\n\'But it\'s raining cats and dogs,\' said Jane.\r\n\r\n\'And Queen Anne is dead,\' rejoined Robert. No one was in a very good\r\ntemper. \'We needn\'t go out to do them; we can just move back the table,\r\nand let them off on the old tea-tray we play toboggans with. I don\'t\r\nknow what YOU think, but _I_ think it\'s time we did something, and\r\nthat would be really useful; because then we shouldn\'t just HOPE the\r\nfireworks would make those Prossers sit up--we should KNOW.\'\r\n\r\n\'It WOULD be something to do,\' Cyril owned with languid approval.\r\n\r\nSo the table was moved back. And then the hole in the carpet, that\r\nhad been near the window till the carpet was turned round, showed most\r\nawfully. But Anthea stole out on tip-toe, and got the tray when cook\r\nwasn\'t looking, and brought it in and put it over the hole.\r\n\r\nThen all the fireworks were put on the table, and each of the four\r\nchildren shut its eyes very tight and put out its hand and grasped\r\nsomething. Robert took a cracker, Cyril and Anthea had Roman candles;\r\nbut Jane\'s fat paw closed on the gem of the whole collection, the\r\nJack-in-the-box that had cost two shillings, and one at least of the\r\nparty--I will not say which, because it was sorry afterwards--declared\r\nthat Jane had done it on purpose. Nobody was pleased. For the worst of\r\nit was that these four children, with a very proper dislike of anything\r\neven faintly bordering on the sneakish, had a law, unalterable as those\r\nof the Medes and Persians, that one had to stand by the results of a\r\ntoss-up, or a drawing of lots, or any other appeal to chance, however\r\nmuch one might happen to dislike the way things were turning out.\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t mean to,\' said Jane, near tears. \'I don\'t care, I\'ll draw\r\nanother--\'\r\n\r\n\'You know jolly well you can\'t,\' said Cyril, bitterly. \'It\'s settled.\r\nIt\'s Medium and Persian. You\'ve done it, and you\'ll have to stand by\r\nit--and us too, worse luck. Never mind. YOU\'LL have your pocket-money\r\nbefore the Fifth. Anyway, we\'ll have the Jack-in-the-box LAST, and get\r\nthe most out of it we can.\'\r\n\r\nSo the cracker and the Roman candles were lighted, and they were\r\nall that could be expected for the money; but when it came to the\r\nJack-in-the-box it simply sat in the tray and laughed at them, as Cyril\r\nsaid. They tried to light it with paper and they tried to light it with\r\nmatches; they tried to light it with Vesuvian fusees from the pocket\r\nof father\'s second-best overcoat that was hanging in the hall. And then\r\nAnthea slipped away to the cupboard under the stairs where the brooms\r\nand dustpans were kept, and the rosiny fire-lighters that smell so nice\r\nand like the woods where pine-trees grow, and the old newspapers and the\r\nbees-wax and turpentine, and the horrid an stiff dark rags that are used\r\nfor cleaning brass and furniture, and the paraffin for the lamps. She\r\ncame back with a little pot that had once cost sevenpence-halfpenny when\r\nit was full of red-currant jelly; but the jelly had been all eaten long\r\nago, and now Anthea had filled the jar with paraffin. She came in, and\r\nshe threw the paraffin over the tray just at the moment when Cyril was\r\ntrying with the twenty-third match to light the Jack-in-the-box. The\r\nJack-in-the-box did not catch fire any more than usual, but the paraffin\r\nacted quite differently, and in an instant a hot flash of flame leapt\r\nup and burnt off Cyril\'s eyelashes, and scorched the faces of all\r\nfour before they could spring back. They backed, in four instantaneous\r\nbounds, as far as they could, which was to the wall, and the pillar of\r\nfire reached from floor to ceiling.\r\n\r\n\'My hat,\' said Cyril, with emotion, \'You\'ve done it this time, Anthea.\'\r\n\r\nThe flame was spreading out under the ceiling like the rose of fire in\r\nMr Rider Haggard\'s exciting story about Allan Quatermain. Robert and\r\nCyril saw that no time was to be lost. They turned up the edges of the\r\ncarpet, and kicked them over the tray. This cut off the column of fire,\r\nand it disappeared and there was nothing left but smoke and a dreadful\r\nsmell of lamps that have been turned too low.\r\n\r\nAll hands now rushed to the rescue, and the paraffin fire was only a\r\nbundle of trampled carpet, when suddenly a sharp crack beneath their\r\nfeet made the amateur firemen start back. Another crack--the carpet\r\nmoved as if it had had a cat wrapped in it; the Jack-in-the-box had at\r\nlast allowed itself to be lighted, and it was going off with desperate\r\nviolence inside the carpet.\r\n\r\nRobert, with the air of one doing the only possible thing, rushed to the\r\nwindow and opened it. Anthea screamed, Jane burst into tears, and\r\nCyril turned the table wrong way up on top of the carpet heap. But the\r\nfirework went on, banging and bursting and spluttering even underneath\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nNext moment mother rushed in, attracted by the howls of Anthea, and in a\r\nfew moments the firework desisted and there was a dead silence, and\r\nthe children stood looking at each other\'s black faces, and, out of the\r\ncorners of their eyes, at mother\'s white one.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the nursery carpet was ruined occasioned but little\r\nsurprise, nor was any one really astonished that bed should prove the\r\nimmediate end of the adventure. It has been said that all roads lead to\r\nRome; this may be true, but at any rate, in early youth I am quite sure\r\nthat many roads lead to BED, and stop there--or YOU do.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the fireworks were confiscated, and mother was not pleased\r\nwhen father let them off himself in the back garden, though he said,\r\n\'Well, how else can you get rid of them, my dear?\'\r\n\r\nYou see, father had forgotten that the children were in disgrace, and\r\nthat their bedroom windows looked out on to the back garden. So that\r\nthey all saw the fireworks most beautifully, and admired the skill with\r\nwhich father handled them.\r\n\r\nNext day all was forgotten and forgiven; only the nursery had to\r\nbe deeply cleaned (like spring-cleaning), and the ceiling had to be\r\nwhitewashed.\r\n\r\nAnd mother went out; and just at tea-time next day a man came with a\r\nrolled-up carpet, and father paid him, and mother said--\r\n\r\n\'If the carpet isn\'t in good condition, you know, I shall expect you to\r\nchange it.\' And the man replied--\r\n\r\n\'There ain\'t a thread gone in it nowhere, mum. It\'s a bargain, if ever\r\nthere was one, and I\'m more\'n \'arf sorry I let it go at the price; but\r\nwe can\'t resist the lydies, can we, sir?\' and he winked at father and\r\nwent away.\r\n\r\nThen the carpet was put down in the nursery, and sure enough there\r\nwasn\'t a hole in it anywhere.\r\n\r\nAs the last fold was unrolled something hard and loud-sounding bumped\r\nout of it and trundled along the nursery floor. All the children\r\nscrambled for it, and Cyril got it. He took it to the gas. It was shaped\r\nlike an egg, very yellow and shiny, half-transparent, and it had an odd\r\nsort of light in it that changed as you held it in different ways. It\r\nwas as though it was an egg with a yolk of pale fire that just showed\r\nthrough the stone.\r\n\r\n\'I MAY keep it, mayn\'t I, mother?\' Cyril asked.\r\n\r\nAnd of course mother said no; they must take it back to the man who had\r\nbrought the carpet, because she had only paid for a carpet, and not for\r\na stone egg with a fiery yolk to it.\r\n\r\nSo she told them where the shop was, and it was in the Kentish Town\r\nRoad, not far from the hotel that is called the Bull and Gate. It was\r\na poky little shop, and the man was arranging furniture outside on the\r\npavement very cunningly, so that the more broken parts should show as\r\nlittle as possible. And directly he saw the children he knew them again,\r\nand he began at once, without giving them a chance to speak.\r\n\r\n\'No you don\'t\' he cried loudly; \'I ain\'t a-goin\' to take back no\r\ncarpets, so don\'t you make no bloomin\' errer. A bargain\'s a bargain, and\r\nthe carpet\'s puffik throughout.\'\r\n\r\n\'We don\'t want you to take it back,\' said Cyril; \'but we found something\r\nin it.\'\r\n\r\n\'It must have got into it up at your place, then,\' said the man, with\r\nindignant promptness, \'for there ain\'t nothing in nothing as I sell.\r\nIt\'s all as clean as a whistle.\'\r\n\r\n\'I never said it wasn\'t CLEAN,\' said Cyril, \'but--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, if it\'s MOTHS,\' said the man, \'that\'s easy cured with borax. But I\r\nexpect it was only an odd one. I tell you the carpet\'s good through and\r\nthrough. It hadn\'t got no moths when it left my \'ands--not so much as an\r\nhegg.\'\r\n\r\n\'But that\'s just it,\' interrupted Jane; \'there WAS so much as an egg.\'\r\n\r\nThe man made a sort of rush at the children and stamped his foot.\r\n\r\n\'Clear out, I say!\' he shouted, \'or I\'ll call for the police. A nice\r\nthing for customers to \'ear you a-coming \'ere a-charging me with finding\r\nthings in goods what I sells. \'Ere, be off, afore I sends you off with a\r\nflea in your ears. Hi! constable--\'\r\n\r\nThe children fled, and they think, and their father thinks, that they\r\ncouldn\'t have done anything else. Mother has her own opinion.\r\n\r\nBut father said they might keep the egg.\r\n\r\n\'The man certainly didn\'t know the egg was there when he brought the\r\ncarpet,\' said he, \'any more than your mother did, and we\'ve as much\r\nright to it as he had.\'\r\n\r\nSo the egg was put on the mantelpiece, where it quite brightened up the\r\ndingy nursery. The nursery was dingy, because it was a basement room,\r\nand its windows looked out on a stone area with a rockery made of\r\nclinkers facing the windows. Nothing grew in the rockery except London\r\npride and snails.\r\n\r\nThe room had been described in the house agent\'s list as a \'convenient\r\nbreakfast-room in basement,\' and in the daytime it was rather dark. This\r\ndid not matter so much in the evenings when the gas was alight, but then\r\nit was in the evening that the blackbeetles got so sociable, and used to\r\ncome out of the low cupboards on each side of the fireplace where their\r\nhomes were, and try to make friends with the children. At least, I\r\nsuppose that was what they wanted, but the children never would.\r\n\r\nOn the Fifth of November father and mother went to the theatre, and\r\nthe children were not happy, because the Prossers next door had lots of\r\nfireworks and they had none.\r\n\r\nThey were not even allowed to have a bonfire in the garden.\r\n\r\n\'No more playing with fire, thank you,\' was father\'s answer, when they\r\nasked him.\r\n\r\nWhen the baby had been put to bed the children sat sadly round the fire\r\nin the nursery.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m beastly bored,\' said Robert.\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s talk about the Psammead,\' said Anthea, who generally tried to\r\ngive the conversation a cheerful turn.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s the good of TALKING?\' said Cyril. \'What I want is for something\r\nto happen. It\'s awfully stuffy for a chap not to be allowed out in the\r\nevenings. There\'s simply nothing to do when you\'ve got through your\r\nhomers.\'\r\n\r\nJane finished the last of her home-lessons and shut the book with a\r\nbang.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ve got the pleasure of memory,\' said she. \'Just think of last\r\nholidays.\'\r\n\r\nLast holidays, indeed, offered something to think of--for they had\r\nbeen spent in the country at a white house between a sand-pit and a\r\ngravel-pit, and things had happened. The children had found a Psammead,\r\nor sand-fairy, and it had let them have anything they wished for--just\r\nexactly anything, with no bother about its not being really for their\r\ngood, or anything like that. And if you want to know what kind of things\r\nthey wished for, and how their wishes turned out you can read it all in\r\na book called Five Children and It (It was the Psammead). If you\'ve not\r\nread it, perhaps I ought to tell you that the fifth child was the baby\r\nbrother, who was called the Lamb, because the first thing he ever said\r\nwas \'Baa!\' and that the other children were not particularly handsome,\r\nnor were they extra clever, nor extraordinarily good. But they were not\r\nbad sorts on the whole; in fact, they were rather like you.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want to think about the pleasures of memory,\' said Cyril; \'I\r\nwant some more things to happen.\'\r\n\r\n\'We\'re very much luckier than any one else, as it is,\' said Jane. \'Why,\r\nno one else ever found a Psammead. We ought to be grateful.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why shouldn\'t we GO ON being, though?\' Cyril asked--\'lucky, I mean, not\r\ngrateful. Why\'s it all got to stop?\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps something will happen,\' said Anthea, comfortably. \'Do you know,\r\nsometimes I think we are the sort of people that things DO happen to.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s like that in history,\' said Jane: \'some kings are full of\r\ninteresting things, and others--nothing ever happens to them, except\r\ntheir being born and crowned and buried, and sometimes not that.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think Panther\'s right,\' said Cyril: \'I think we are the sort of\r\npeople things do happen to. I have a sort of feeling things would happen\r\nright enough if we could only give them a shove. It just wants something\r\nto start it. That\'s all.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish they taught magic at school,\' Jane sighed. \'I believe if we\r\ncould do a little magic it might make something happen.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wonder how you begin?\' Robert looked round the room, but he got no\r\nideas from the faded green curtains, or the drab Venetian blinds, or\r\nthe worn brown oil-cloth on the floor. Even the new carpet suggested\r\nnothing, though its pattern was a very wonderful one, and always seemed\r\nas though it were just going to make you think of something.\r\n\r\n\'I could begin right enough,\' said Anthea; \'I\'ve read lots about it. But\r\nI believe it\'s wrong in the Bible.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s only wrong in the Bible because people wanted to hurt other\r\npeople. I don\'t see how things can be wrong unless they hurt somebody,\r\nand we don\'t want to hurt anybody; and what\'s more, we jolly well\r\ncouldn\'t if we tried. Let\'s get the Ingoldsby Legends. There\'s a thing\r\nabout Abra-cadabra there,\' said Cyril, yawning. \'We may as well play at\r\nmagic. Let\'s be Knights Templars. They were awfully gone on magic. They\r\nused to work spells or something with a goat and a goose. Father says\r\nso.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, that\'s all right,\' said Robert, unkindly; \'you can play the goat\r\nright enough, and Jane knows how to be a goose.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll get Ingoldsby,\' said Anthea, hastily. \'You turn up the hearthrug.\'\r\n\r\nSo they traced strange figures on the linoleum, where the hearthrug had\r\nkept it clean. They traced them with chalk that Robert had nicked\r\nfrom the top of the mathematical master\'s desk at school. You know, of\r\ncourse, that it is stealing to take a new stick of chalk, but it is not\r\nwrong to take a broken piece, so long as you only take one. (I do not\r\nknow the reason of this rule, nor who made it.) And they chanted all the\r\ngloomiest songs they could think of. And, of course, nothing happened.\r\nSo then Anthea said, \'I\'m sure a magic fire ought to be made of\r\nsweet-smelling wood, and have magic gums and essences and things in it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know any sweet-smelling wood, except cedar,\' said Robert; \'but\r\nI\'ve got some ends of cedar-wood lead pencil.\'\r\n\r\nSo they burned the ends of lead pencil. And still nothing happened.\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s burn some of the eucalyptus oil we have for our colds,\' said\r\nAnthea.\r\n\r\nAnd they did. It certainly smelt very strong. And they burned lumps\r\nof camphor out of the big chest. It was very bright, and made a horrid\r\nblack smoke, which looked very magical. But still nothing happened. Then\r\nthey got some clean tea-cloths from the dresser drawer in the kitchen,\r\nand waved them over the magic chalk-tracings, and sang \'The Hymn of the\r\nMoravian Nuns at Bethlehem\', which is very impressive. And still nothing\r\nhappened. So they waved more and more wildly, and Robert\'s tea-cloth\r\ncaught the golden egg and whisked it off the mantelpiece, and it fell\r\ninto the fender and rolled under the grate.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, crikey!\' said more than one voice.\r\n\r\nAnd every one instantly fell down flat on its front to look under the\r\ngrate, and there lay the egg, glowing in a nest of hot ashes.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not smashed, anyhow,\' said Robert, and he put his hand under the\r\ngrate and picked up the egg. But the egg was much hotter than any one\r\nwould have believed it could possibly get in such a short time, and\r\nRobert had to drop it with a cry of \'Bother!\' It fell on the top bar of\r\nthe grate, and bounced right into the glowing red-hot heart of the fire.\r\n\r\n\'The tongs!\' cried Anthea. But, alas, no one could remember where they\r\nwere. Every one had forgotten that the tongs had last been used to fish\r\nup the doll\'s teapot from the bottom of the water-butt, where the Lamb\r\nhad dropped it. So the nursery tongs were resting between the water-butt\r\nand the dustbin, and cook refused to lend the kitchen ones.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind,\' said Robert, \'we\'ll get it out with the poker and the\r\nshovel.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, stop,\' cried Anthea. \'Look at it! Look! look! look! I do believe\r\nsomething IS going to happen!\'\r\n\r\nFor the egg was now red-hot, and inside it something was moving. Next\r\nmoment there was a soft cracking sound; the egg burst in two, and out of\r\nit came a flame-coloured bird. It rested a moment among the flames, and\r\nas it rested there the four children could see it growing bigger and\r\nbigger under their eyes.\r\n\r\nEvery mouth was a-gape, every eye a-goggle.\r\n\r\nThe bird rose in its nest of fire, stretched its wings, and flew out\r\ninto the room. It flew round and round, and round again, and where it\r\npassed the air was warm. Then it perched on the fender. The children\r\nlooked at each other. Then Cyril put out a hand towards the bird. It put\r\nits head on one side and looked up at him, as you may have seen a parrot\r\ndo when it is just going to speak, so that the children were hardly\r\nastonished at all when it said, \'Be careful; I am not nearly cool yet.\'\r\n\r\nThey were not astonished, but they were very, very much interested.\r\n\r\nThey looked at the bird, and it was certainly worth looking at. Its\r\nfeathers were like gold. It was about as large as a bantam, only its\r\nbeak was not at all bantam-shaped. \'I believe I know what it is,\' said\r\nRobert. \'I\'ve seen a picture.\'\r\n\r\nHe hurried away. A hasty dash and scramble among the papers on father\'s\r\nstudy table yielded, as the sum-books say, \'the desired result\'. But\r\nwhen he came back into the room holding out a paper, and crying, \'I say,\r\nlook here,\' the others all said \'Hush!\' and he hushed obediently and\r\ninstantly, for the bird was speaking.\r\n\r\n\'Which of you,\' it was saying, \'put the egg into the fire?\'\r\n\r\n\'He did,\' said three voices, and three fingers pointed at Robert.\r\n\r\nThe bird bowed; at least it was more like that than anything else.\r\n\r\n\'I am your grateful debtor,\' it said with a high-bred air.\r\n\r\nThe children were all choking with wonder and curiosity--all except\r\nRobert. He held the paper in his hand, and he KNEW. He said so. He\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\'_I_ know who you are.\'\r\n\r\nAnd he opened and displayed a printed paper, at the head of which was a\r\nlittle picture of a bird sitting in a nest of flames.\r\n\r\n\'You are the Phoenix,\' said Robert; and the bird was quite pleased.\r\n\r\n\'My fame has lived then for two thousand years,\' it said. \'Allow me to\r\nlook at my portrait.\' It looked at the page which Robert, kneeling down,\r\nspread out in the fender, and said--\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not a flattering likeness... And what are these characters?\' it\r\nasked, pointing to the printed part.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, that\'s all dullish; it\'s not much about YOU, you know,\' said Cyril,\r\nwith unconscious politeness; \'but you\'re in lots of books.\'\r\n\r\n\'With portraits?\' asked the Phoenix.\r\n\r\n\'Well, no,\' said Cyril; \'in fact, I don\'t think I ever saw any portrait\r\nof you but that one, but I can read you something about yourself, if you\r\nlike.\'\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix nodded, and Cyril went off and fetched Volume X of the old\r\nEncyclopedia, and on page 246 he found the following:--\r\n\r\n\'Phoenix--in ornithology, a fabulous bird of antiquity.\'\r\n\r\n\'Antiquity is quite correct,\' said the Phoenix, \'but fabulous--well, do\r\nI look it?\'\r\n\r\nEvery one shook its head. Cyril went on--\r\n\r\n\r\n\'The ancients speak of this bird as single, or the only one of its\r\nkind.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s right enough,\' said the Phoenix.\r\n\r\n\'They describe it as about the size of an eagle.\'\r\n\r\n\'Eagles are of different sizes,\' said the Phoenix; \'it\'s not at all a\r\ngood description.\'\r\n\r\nAll the children were kneeling on the hearthrug, to be as near the\r\nPhoenix as possible.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll boil your brains,\' it said. \'Look out, I\'m nearly cool now;\' and\r\nwith a whirr of golden wings it fluttered from the fender to the table.\r\nIt was so nearly cool that there was only a very faint smell of burning\r\nwhen it had settled itself on the table-cloth.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s only a very little scorched,\' said the Phoenix, apologetically;\r\n\'it will come out in the wash. Please go on reading.\'\r\n\r\nThe children gathered round the table.\r\n\r\n\'The size of an eagle,\' Cyril went on, \'its head finely crested with a\r\nbeautiful plumage, its neck covered with feathers of a gold colour, and\r\nthe rest of its body purple; only the tail white, and the eyes sparkling\r\nlike stars. They say that it lives about five hundred years in the\r\nwilderness, and when advanced in age it builds itself a pile of sweet\r\nwood and aromatic gums, fires it with the wafting of its wings, and thus\r\nburns itself; and that from its ashes arises a worm, which in time grows\r\nup to be a Phoenix. Hence the Phoenicians gave--\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind what they gave,\' said the Phoenix, ruffling its golden\r\nfeathers. \'They never gave much, anyway; they always were people who\r\ngave nothing for nothing. That book ought to be destroyed. It\'s\r\nmost inaccurate. The rest of my body was never purple, and as for\r\nmy--tail--well, I simply ask you, IS it white?\'\r\n\r\nIt turned round and gravely presented its golden tail to the children.\r\n\r\n\'No, it\'s not,\' said everybody.\r\n\r\n\'No, and it never was,\' said the Phoenix. \'And that about the worm\r\nis just a vulgar insult. The Phoenix has an egg, like all respectable\r\nbirds. It makes a pile--that part\'s all right--and it lays its egg, and\r\nit burns itself; and it goes to sleep and wakes up in its egg, and comes\r\nout and goes on living again, and so on for ever and ever. I can\'t tell\r\nyou how weary I got of it--such a restless existence; no repose.\'\r\n\r\n\'But how did your egg get HERE?\' asked Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, that\'s my life-secret,\' said the Phoenix. \'I couldn\'t tell it to\r\nany one who wasn\'t really sympathetic. I\'ve always been a misunderstood\r\nbird. You can tell that by what they say about the worm. I might tell\r\nYOU,\' it went on, looking at Robert with eyes that were indeed starry.\r\n\'You put me on the fire--\' Robert looked uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\'The rest of us made the fire of sweet-scented woods and gums, though,\'\r\nsaid Cyril.\r\n\r\n\'And--and it was an accident my putting you on the fire,\' said Robert,\r\ntelling the truth with some difficulty, for he did not know how the\r\nPhoenix might take it. It took it in the most unexpected manner.\r\n\r\n\'Your candid avowal,\' it said, \'removes my last scruple. I will tell you\r\nmy story.\'\r\n\r\n\'And you won\'t vanish, or anything sudden will you? asked Anthea,\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\'Why?\' it asked, puffing out the golden feathers, \'do you wish me to\r\nstay here?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh YES,\' said every one, with unmistakable sincerity.\r\n\r\n\'Why?\' asked the Phoenix again, looking modestly at the table-cloth.\r\n\r\n\'Because,\' said every one at once, and then stopped short; only Jane\r\nadded after a pause, \'you are the most beautiful person we\'ve ever\r\nseen.\' \'You are a sensible child,\' said the Phoenix, \'and I will NOT\r\nvanish or anything sudden. And I will tell you my tale. I had resided,\r\nas your book says, for many thousand years in the wilderness, which is\r\na large, quiet place with very little really good society, and I was\r\nbecoming weary of the monotony of my existence. But I acquired the habit\r\nof laying my egg and burning myself every five hundred years--and you\r\nknow how difficult it is to break yourself of a habit.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Cyril; \'Jane used to bite her nails.\'\r\n\r\n\'But I broke myself of it,\' urged Jane, rather hurt, \'You know I did.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not till they put bitter aloes on them,\' said Cyril.\r\n\r\n\'I doubt,\' said the bird, gravely, \'whether even bitter aloes (the aloe,\r\nby the way, has a bad habit of its own, which it might well cure before\r\nseeking to cure others; I allude to its indolent practice of flowering\r\nbut once a century), I doubt whether even bitter aloes could have cured\r\nME. But I WAS cured. I awoke one morning from a feverish dream--it was\r\ngetting near the time for me to lay that tiresome fire and lay that\r\ntedious egg upon it--and I saw two people, a man and a woman. They were\r\nsitting on a carpet--and when I accosted them civilly they narrated to\r\nme their life-story, which, as you have not yet heard it, I will now\r\nproceed to relate. They were a prince and princess, and the story of\r\ntheir parents was one which I am sure you will like to hear. In early\r\nyouth the mother of the princess happened to hear the story of a certain\r\nenchanter, and in that story I am sure you will be interested. The\r\nenchanter--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, please don\'t,\' said Anthea. \'I can\'t understand all these\r\nbeginnings of stories, and you seem to be getting deeper and deeper in\r\nthem every minute. Do tell us your OWN story. That\'s what we really want\r\nto hear.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said the Phoenix, seeming on the whole rather flattered, \'to\r\ncut about seventy long stories short (though _I_ had to listen to them\r\nall--but to be sure in the wilderness there is plenty of time), this\r\nprince and princess were so fond of each other that they did not want\r\nany one else, and the enchanter--don\'t be alarmed, I won\'t go into\r\nhis history--had given them a magic carpet (you\'ve heard of a magic\r\ncarpet?), and they had just sat on it and told it to take them right\r\naway from every one--and it had brought them to the wilderness. And as\r\nthey meant to stay there they had no further use for the carpet, so they\r\ngave it to me. That was indeed the chance of a lifetime!\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t see what you wanted with a carpet,\' said Jane, \'when you\'ve got\r\nthose lovely wings.\'\r\n\r\n\'They ARE nice wings, aren\'t they?\' said the Phoenix, simpering and\r\nspreading them out. \'Well, I got the prince to lay out the carpet, and I\r\nlaid my egg on it; then I said to the carpet, "Now, my excellent carpet,\r\nprove your worth. Take that egg somewhere where it can\'t be hatched for\r\ntwo thousand years, and where, when that time\'s up, some one will light\r\na fire of sweet wood and aromatic gums, and put the egg in to hatch;"\r\nand you see it\'s all come out exactly as I said. The words were no\r\nsooner out of my beak than egg and carpet disappeared. The royal lovers\r\nassisted to arrange my pile, and soothed my last moments. I burnt myself\r\nup and knew no more till I awoke on yonder altar.\'\r\n\r\nIt pointed its claw at the grate.\r\n\r\n\'But the carpet,\' said Robert, \'the magic carpet that takes you anywhere\r\nyou wish. What became of that?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, THAT?\' said the Phoenix, carelessly--\'I should say that that is the\r\ncarpet. I remember the pattern perfectly.\'\r\n\r\nIt pointed as it spoke to the floor, where lay the carpet which mother\r\nhad bought in the Kentish Town Road for twenty-two shillings and\r\nninepence.\r\n\r\nAt that instant father\'s latch-key was heard in the door.\r\n\r\n\'OH,\' whispered Cyril, \'now we shall catch it for not being in bed!\'\r\n\r\n\'Wish yourself there,\' said the Phoenix, in a hurried whisper, \'and then\r\nwish the carpet back in its place.\'\r\n\r\nNo sooner said than done. It made one a little giddy, certainly, and a\r\nlittle breathless; but when things seemed right way up again, there the\r\nchildren were, in bed, and the lights were out.\r\n\r\nThey heard the soft voice of the Phoenix through the darkness.\r\n\r\n\'I shall sleep on the cornice above your curtains,\' it said. \'Please\r\ndon\'t mention me to your kinsfolk.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not much good,\' said Robert, \'they\'d never believe us. I say,\' he\r\ncalled through the half-open door to the girls; \'talk about adventures\r\nand things happening. We ought to be able to get some fun out of a magic\r\ncarpet AND a Phoenix.\'\r\n\r\n\'Rather,\' said the girls, in bed.\r\n\r\n\'Children,\' said father, on the stairs, \'go to sleep at once. What do\r\nyou mean by talking at this time of night?\'\r\n\r\nNo answer was expected to this question, but under the bedclothes Cyril\r\nmurmured one.\r\n\r\n\'Mean?\' he said. \'Don\'t know what we mean. I don\'t know what anything\r\nmeans.\'\r\n\r\n\'But we\'ve got a magic carpet AND a Phoenix,\' said Robert.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll get something else if father comes in and catches you,\' said\r\nCyril. \'Shut up, I tell you.\'\r\n\r\nRobert shut up. But he knew as well as you do that the adventures of\r\nthat carpet and that Phoenix were only just beginning.\r\n\r\nFather and mother had not the least idea of what had happened in their\r\nabsence. This is often the case, even when there are no magic carpets or\r\nPhoenixes in the house.\r\n\r\nThe next morning--but I am sure you would rather wait till the next\r\nchapter before you hear about THAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. THE TOPLESS TOWER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe children had seen the Phoenix-egg hatched in the flames in their own\r\nnursery grate, and had heard from it how the carpet on their own nursery\r\nfloor was really the wishing carpet, which would take them anywhere they\r\nchose. The carpet had transported them to bed just at the right\r\nmoment, and the Phoenix had gone to roost on the cornice supporting the\r\nwindow-curtains of the boys\' room.\r\n\r\n\'Excuse me,\' said a gentle voice, and a courteous beak opened, very\r\nkindly and delicately, the right eye of Cyril. \'I hear the slaves below\r\npreparing food. Awaken! A word of explanation and arrangement... I do\r\nwish you wouldn\'t--\'\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix stopped speaking and fluttered away crossly to the\r\ncornice-pole; for Cyril had hit out, as boys do when they are awakened\r\nsuddenly, and the Phoenix was not used to boys, and his feelings, if not\r\nhis wings, were hurt.\r\n\r\n\'Sorry,\' said Cyril, coming awake all in a minute. \'Do come back! What\r\nwas it you were saying? Something about bacon and rations?\'\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix fluttered back to the brass rail at the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\n\'I say--you ARE real,\' said Cyril. \'How ripping! And the carpet?\'\r\n\r\n\'The carpet is as real as it ever was,\' said the Phoenix, rather\r\ncontemptuously; \'but, of course, a carpet\'s only a carpet, whereas a\r\nPhoenix is superlatively a Phoenix.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, indeed,\' said Cyril, \'I see it is. Oh, what luck! Wake up, Bobs!\r\nThere\'s jolly well something to wake up for today. And it\'s Saturday,\r\ntoo.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve been reflecting,\' said the Phoenix, \'during the silent watches\r\nof the night, and I could not avoid the conclusion that you were quite\r\ninsufficiently astonished at my appearance yesterday. The ancients were\r\nalways VERY surprised. Did you, by chance, EXPECT my egg to hatch?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not us,\' Cyril said.\r\n\r\n\'And if we had,\' said Anthea, who had come in in her nightie when she\r\nheard the silvery voice of the Phoenix, \'we could never, never have\r\nexpected it to hatch anything so splendid as you.\'\r\n\r\nThe bird smiled. Perhaps you\'ve never seen a bird smile?\r\n\r\n\'You see,\' said Anthea, wrapping herself in the boys\' counterpane, for\r\nthe morning was chill, \'we\'ve had things happen to us before;\' and she\r\ntold the story of the Psammead, or sand-fairy.\r\n\r\n\'Ah yes,\' said the Phoenix; \'Psammeads were rare, even in my time. I\r\nremember I used to be called the Psammead of the Desert. I was always\r\nhaving compliments paid me; I can\'t think why.\'\r\n\r\n\'Can YOU give wishes, then?\' asked Jane, who had now come in too.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, dear me, no,\' said the Phoenix, contemptuously, \'at least--but I\r\nhear footsteps approaching. I hasten to conceal myself.\' And it did.\r\n\r\nI think I said that this day was Saturday. It was also cook\'s birthday,\r\nand mother had allowed her and Eliza to go to the Crystal Palace with a\r\nparty of friends, so Jane and Anthea of course had to help to make beds\r\nand to wash up the breakfast cups, and little things like that. Robert\r\nand Cyril intended to spend the morning in conversation with the\r\nPhoenix, but the bird had its own ideas about this.\r\n\r\n\'I must have an hour or two\'s quiet,\' it said, \'I really must. My nerves\r\nwill give way unless I can get a little rest. You must remember it\'s two\r\nthousand years since I had any conversation--I\'m out of practice, and I\r\nmust take care of myself. I\'ve often been told that mine is a valuable\r\nlife.\' So it nestled down inside an old hatbox of father\'s, which had\r\nbeen brought down from the box-room some days before, when a helmet was\r\nsuddenly needed for a game of tournaments, with its golden head under\r\nits golden wing, and went to sleep. So then Robert and Cyril moved\r\nthe table back and were going to sit on the carpet and wish themselves\r\nsomewhere else. But before they could decide on the place, Cyril said--\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know. Perhaps it\'s rather sneakish to begin without the girls.\'\r\n\r\n\'They\'ll be all the morning,\' said Robert, impatiently. And then a thing\r\ninside him, which tiresome books sometimes call the \'inward monitor\',\r\nsaid, \'Why don\'t you help them, then?\'\r\n\r\nCyril\'s \'inward monitor\' happened to say the same thing at the same\r\nmoment, so the boys went and helped to wash up the tea-cups, and to dust\r\nthe drawing-room. Robert was so interested that he proposed to clean\r\nthe front doorsteps--a thing he had never been allowed to do. Nor was\r\nhe allowed to do it on this occasion. One reason was that it had already\r\nbeen done by cook.\r\n\r\nWhen all the housework was finished, the girls dressed the happy,\r\nwriggling baby in his blue highwayman coat and three-cornered hat, and\r\nkept him amused while mother changed her dress and got ready to take\r\nhim over to granny\'s. Mother always went to granny\'s every Saturday,\r\nand generally some of the children went with her; but today they were to\r\nkeep house. And their hearts were full of joyous and delightful feelings\r\nevery time they remembered that the house they would have to keep had a\r\nPhoenix in it, AND a wishing carpet.\r\n\r\nYou can always keep the Lamb good and happy for quite a long time if you\r\nplay the Noah\'s Ark game with him. It is quite simple. He just sits on\r\nyour lap and tells you what animal he is, and then you say the little\r\npoetry piece about whatever animal he chooses to be.\r\n\r\nOf course, some of the animals, like the zebra and the tiger, haven\'t\r\ngot any poetry, because they are so difficult to rhyme to. The Lamb\r\nknows quite well which are the poetry animals.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m a baby bear!\' said the Lamb, snugging down; and Anthea began:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \'I love my little baby bear,\r\n     I love his nose and toes and hair;\r\n     I like to hold him in my arm,\r\n     And keep him VERY safe and warm.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd when she said \'very\', of course there was a real bear\'s hug.\r\n\r\nThen came the eel, and the Lamb was tickled till he wriggled exactly\r\nlike a real one:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \'I love my little baby eel,\r\n     He is so squidglety to feel;\r\n     He\'ll be an eel when he is big--\r\n     But now he\'s just--a--tiny SNIG!\'\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps you didn\'t know that a snig was a baby eel? It is, though, and\r\nthe Lamb knew it.\r\n\r\n\'Hedgehog now-!\' he said; and Anthea went on:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \'My baby hedgehog, how I like ye,\r\n     Though your back\'s so prickly-spiky;\r\n     Your front is very soft, I\'ve found,\r\n     So I must love you front ways round!\'\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then she loved him front ways round, while he squealed with\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nIt is a very baby game, and, of course, the rhymes are only meant for\r\nvery, very small people--not for people who are old enough to read\r\nbooks, so I won\'t tell you any more of them.\r\n\r\nBy the time the Lamb had been a baby lion and a baby weazel, and a baby\r\nrabbit and a baby rat, mother was ready; and she and the Lamb, having\r\nbeen kissed by everybody and hugged as thoroughly as it is possible to\r\nbe when you\'re dressed for out-of-doors, were seen to the tram by the\r\nboys. When the boys came back, every one looked at every one else and\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\'Now!\'\r\n\r\nThey locked the front door and they locked the back door, and they\r\nfastened all the windows. They moved the table and chairs off the\r\ncarpet, and Anthea swept it.\r\n\r\n\'We must show it a LITTLE attention,\' she said kindly. \'We\'ll give it\r\ntea-leaves next time. Carpets like tea-leaves.\'\r\n\r\nThen every one put on its out-door things, because as Cyril said, they\r\ndidn\'t know where they might be going, and it makes people stare if you\r\ngo out of doors in November in pinafores and without hats.\r\n\r\nThen Robert gently awoke the Phoenix, who yawned and stretched itself,\r\nand allowed Robert to lift it on to the middle of the carpet, where it\r\ninstantly went to sleep again with its crested head tucked under its\r\ngolden wing as before. Then every one sat down on the carpet.\r\n\r\n\'Where shall we go?\' was of course the question, and it was warmly\r\ndiscussed. Anthea wanted to go to Japan. Robert and Cyril voted for\r\nAmerica, and Jane wished to go to the seaside.\r\n\r\n\'Because there are donkeys there,\' said she.\r\n\r\n\'Not in November, silly,\' said Cyril; and the discussion got warmer and\r\nwarmer, and still nothing was settled.\r\n\r\n\'I vote we let the Phoenix decide,\' said Robert, at last. So they\r\nstroked it till it woke. \'We want to go somewhere abroad,\' they said,\r\n\'and we can\'t make up our minds where.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let the carpet make up ITS mind, if it has one,\' said the Phoenix.\r\n\r\n\'Just say you wish to go abroad.\'\r\n\r\nSo they did; and the next moment the world seemed to spin upside down,\r\nand when it was right way up again and they were ungiddy enough to look\r\nabout them, they were out of doors.\r\n\r\nOut of doors--this is a feeble way to express where they were. They\r\nwere out of--out of the earth, or off it. In fact, they were floating\r\nsteadily, safely, splendidly, in the crisp clear air, with the pale\r\nbright blue of the sky above them, and far down below the pale bright\r\nsun-diamonded waves of the sea. The carpet had stiffened itself somehow,\r\nso that it was square and firm like a raft, and it steered itself so\r\nbeautifully and kept on its way so flat and fearless that no one was at\r\nall afraid of tumbling off. In front of them lay land.\r\n\r\n\'The coast of France,\' said the Phoenix, waking up and pointing with\r\nits wing. \'Where do you wish to go? I should always keep one wish, of\r\ncourse--for emergencies--otherwise you may get into an emergency from\r\nwhich you can\'t emerge at all.\'\r\n\r\nBut the children were far too deeply interested to listen.\r\n\r\n\'I tell you what,\' said Cyril: \'let\'s let the thing go on and on, and\r\nwhen we see a place we really want to stop at--why, we\'ll just stop.\r\nIsn\'t this ripping?\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s like trains,\' said Anthea, as they swept over the low-lying\r\ncoast-line and held a steady course above orderly fields and straight\r\nroads bordered with poplar trees--\'like express trains, only in trains\r\nyou never can see anything because of grown-ups wanting the windows\r\nshut; and then they breathe on them, and it\'s like ground glass, and\r\nnobody can see anything, and then they go to sleep.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s like tobogganing,\' said Robert, \'so fast and smooth, only there\'s\r\nno door-mat to stop short on--it goes on and on.\'\r\n\r\n\'You darling Phoenix,\' said Jane, \'it\'s all your doing. Oh, look at\r\nthat ducky little church and the women with flappy cappy things on their\r\nheads.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t mention it,\' said the Phoenix, with sleepy politeness.\r\n\r\n\'OH!\' said Cyril, summing up all the rapture that was in every heart.\r\n\'Look at it all--look at it--and think of the Kentish Town Road!\'\r\n\r\nEvery one looked and every one thought. And the glorious, gliding,\r\nsmooth, steady rush went on, and they looked down on strange and\r\nbeautiful things, and held their breath and let it go in deep sighs, and\r\nsaid \'Oh!\' and \'Ah!\' till it was long past dinner-time.\r\n\r\nIt was Jane who suddenly said, \'I wish we\'d brought that jam tart and\r\ncold mutton with us. It would have been jolly to have a picnic in the\r\nair.\'\r\n\r\nThe jam tart and cold mutton were, however, far away, sitting quietly in\r\nthe larder of the house in Camden Town which the children were supposed\r\nto be keeping. A mouse was at that moment tasting the outside of the\r\nraspberry jam part of the tart (she had nibbled a sort of gulf, or bay,\r\nthrough the pastry edge) to see whether it was the sort of dinner she\r\ncould ask her little mouse-husband to sit down to. She had had a very\r\ngood dinner herself. It is an ill wind that blows nobody any good.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll stop as soon as we see a nice place,\' said Anthea. \'I\'ve got\r\nthreepence, and you boys have the fourpence each that your trams didn\'t\r\ncost the other day, so we can buy things to eat. I expect the Phoenix\r\ncan speak French.\'\r\n\r\nThe carpet was sailing along over rocks and rivers and trees and towns\r\nand farms and fields. It reminded everybody of a certain time when all\r\nof them had had wings, and had flown up to the top of a church tower,\r\nand had had a feast there of chicken and tongue and new bread and\r\nsoda-water. And this again reminded them how hungry they were. And just\r\nas they were all being reminded of this very strongly indeed, they saw\r\nahead of them some ruined walls on a hill, and strong and upright, and\r\nreally, to look at, as good as new--a great square tower.\r\n\r\n\'The top of that\'s just the exactly same size as the carpet,\' said Jane.\r\n\'_I_ think it would be good to go to the top of that, because then none\r\nof the Abby-what\'s-its-names--I mean natives--would be able to take the\r\ncarpet away even if they wanted to. And some of us could go out and get\r\nthings to eat--buy them honestly, I mean, not take them out of larder\r\nwindows.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think it would be better if we went--\' Anthea was beginning; but Jane\r\nsuddenly clenched her hands.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t see why I should never do anything I want, just because I\'m\r\nthe youngest. I wish the carpet would fit itself in at the top of that\r\ntower--so there!\'\r\n\r\nThe carpet made a disconcerting bound, and next moment it was hovering\r\nabove the square top of the tower. Then slowly and carefully it began to\r\nsink under them. It was like a lift going down with you at the Army and\r\nNavy Stores.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think we ought to wish things without all agreeing to them\r\nfirst,\' said Robert, huffishly. \'Hullo! What on earth?\'\r\n\r\nFor unexpectedly and greyly something was coming up all round the four\r\nsides of the carpet. It was as if a wall were being built by magic\r\nquickness. It was a foot high--it was two feet high--three, four, five.\r\nIt was shutting out the light--more and more.\r\n\r\nAnthea looked up at the sky and the walls that now rose six feet above\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\'We\'re dropping into the tower,\' she screamed. \'THERE WASN\'T ANY TOP TO\r\nIT. So the carpet\'s going to fit itself in at the bottom.\'\r\n\r\nRobert sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n\'We ought to have--Hullo! an owl\'s nest.\' He put his knee on a jutting\r\nsmooth piece of grey stone, and reached his hand into a deep window\r\nslit--broad to the inside of the tower, and narrowing like a funnel to\r\nthe outside.\r\n\r\n\'Look sharp!\' cried every one, but Robert did not look sharp enough. By\r\nthe time he had drawn his hand out of the owl\'s nest--there were no eggs\r\nthere--the carpet had sunk eight feet below him.\r\n\r\n\'Jump, you silly cuckoo!\' cried Cyril, with brotherly anxiety.\r\n\r\nBut Robert couldn\'t turn round all in a minute into a jumping position.\r\nHe wriggled and twisted and got on to the broad ledge, and by the time\r\nhe was ready to jump the walls of the tower had risen up thirty feet\r\nabove the others, who were still sinking with the carpet, and Robert\r\nfound himself in the embrasure of a window; alone, for even the owls\r\nwere not at home that day. The wall was smoothish; there was no climbing\r\nup, and as for climbing down--Robert hid his face in his hands, and\r\nsquirmed back and back from the giddy verge, until the back part of him\r\nwas wedged quite tight in the narrowest part of the window slit.\r\n\r\nHe was safe now, of course, but the outside part of his window was like\r\na frame to a picture of part of the other side of the tower. It was very\r\npretty, with moss growing between the stones and little shiny gems; but\r\nbetween him and it there was the width of the tower, and nothing in it\r\nbut empty air. The situation was terrible. Robert saw in a flash that\r\nthe carpet was likely to bring them into just the same sort of tight\r\nplaces that they used to get into with the wishes the Psammead granted\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnd the others--imagine their feelings as the carpet sank slowly and\r\nsteadily to the very bottom of the tower, leaving Robert clinging to the\r\nwall. Robert did not even try to imagine their feelings--he had quite\r\nenough to do with his own; but you can.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the carpet came to a stop on the ground at the bottom of the\r\ninside of the tower it suddenly lost that raft-like stiffness which had\r\nbeen such a comfort during the journey from Camden Town to the topless\r\ntower, and spread itself limply over the loose stones and little earthy\r\nmounds at the bottom of the tower, just exactly like any ordinary\r\ncarpet. Also it shrank suddenly, so that it seemed to draw away from\r\nunder their feet, and they stepped quickly off the edges and stood on\r\nthe firm ground, while the carpet drew itself in till it was its proper\r\nsize, and no longer fitted exactly into the inside of the tower, but\r\nleft quite a big space all round it.\r\n\r\nThen across the carpet they looked at each other, and then every chin\r\nwas tilted up and every eye sought vainly to see where poor Robert had\r\ngot to. Of course, they couldn\'t see him.\r\n\r\n\'I wish we hadn\'t come,\' said Jane.\r\n\r\n\'You always do,\' said Cyril, briefly. \'Look here, we can\'t leave Robert\r\nup there. I wish the carpet would fetch him down.\'\r\n\r\nThe carpet seemed to awake from a dream and pull itself together. It\r\nstiffened itself briskly and floated up between the four walls of the\r\ntower. The children below craned their heads back, and nearly broke\r\ntheir necks in doing it. The carpet rose and rose. It hung poised darkly\r\nabove them for an anxious moment or two; then it dropped down again,\r\nthrew itself on the uneven floor of the tower, and as it did so it\r\ntumbled Robert out on the uneven floor of the tower.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, glory!\' said Robert, \'that was a squeak. You don\'t know how I felt.\r\nI say, I\'ve had about enough for a bit. Let\'s wish ourselves at home\r\nagain and have a go at that jam tart and mutton. We can go out again\r\nafterwards.\'\r\n\r\n\'Righto!\' said every one, for the adventure had shaken the nerves of\r\nall. So they all got on to the carpet again, and said--\r\n\r\n\'I wish we were at home.\'\r\n\r\nAnd lo and behold, they were no more at home than before. The carpet\r\nnever moved. The Phoenix had taken the opportunity to go to sleep.\r\nAnthea woke it up gently.\r\n\r\n\'Look here,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m looking,\' said the Phoenix.\r\n\r\n\'We WISHED to be at home, and we\'re still here,\' complained Jane.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said the Phoenix, looking about it at the high dark walls of the\r\ntower. \'No; I quite see that.\'\r\n\r\n\'But we wished to be at home,\' said Cyril.\r\n\r\n\'No doubt,\' said the bird, politely.\r\n\r\n\'And the carpet hasn\'t moved an inch,\' said Robert.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said the Phoenix, \'I see it hasn\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'But I thought it was a wishing carpet?\'\r\n\r\n\'So it is,\' said the Phoenix.\r\n\r\n\'Then why--?\' asked the children, altogether.\r\n\r\n\'I did tell you, you know,\' said the Phoenix, \'only you are so fond\r\nof listening to the music of your own voices. It is, indeed, the most\r\nlovely music to each of us, and therefore--\'\r\n\r\n\'You did tell us WHAT?\' interrupted an Exasperated.\r\n\r\n\'Why, that the carpet only gives you three wishes a day and YOU\'VE HAD\r\nTHEM.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a heartfelt silence.\r\n\r\n\'Then how are we going to get home?\' said Cyril, at last.\r\n\r\n\'I haven\'t any idea,\' replied the Phoenix, kindly. \'Can I fly out and\r\nget you any little thing?\'\r\n\r\n\'How could you carry the money to pay for it?\'\r\n\r\n\'It isn\'t necessary. Birds always take what they want. It is not\r\nregarded as stealing, except in the case of magpies.\'\r\n\r\nThe children were glad to find they had been right in supposing this to\r\nbe the case, on the day when they had wings, and had enjoyed somebody\r\nelse\'s ripe plums.\r\n\r\n\'Yes; let the Phoenix get us something to eat, anyway,\' Robert urged--\'\r\n(\'If it will be so kind you mean,\' corrected Anthea, in a whisper); \'if\r\nit will be so kind, and we can be thinking while it\'s gone.\'\r\n\r\nSo the Phoenix fluttered up through the grey space of the tower and\r\nvanished at the top, and it was not till it had quite gone that Jane\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\'Suppose it never comes back.\'\r\n\r\nIt was not a pleasant thought, and though Anthea at once said, \'Of\r\ncourse it will come back; I\'m certain it\'s a bird of its word,\' a\r\nfurther gloom was cast by the idea. For, curiously enough, there was\r\nno door to the tower, and all the windows were far, far too high to be\r\nreached by the most adventurous climber. It was cold, too, and Anthea\r\nshivered.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Cyril, \'it\'s like being at the bottom of a well.\'\r\n\r\nThe children waited in a sad and hungry silence, and got little stiff\r\nnecks with holding their little heads back to look up the inside of the\r\ntall grey tower, to see if the Phoenix were coming.\r\n\r\nAt last it came. It looked very big as it fluttered down between the\r\nwalls, and as it neared them the children saw that its bigness was\r\ncaused by a basket of boiled chestnuts which it carried in one claw.\r\nIn the other it held a piece of bread. And in its beak was a very large\r\npear. The pear was juicy, and as good as a very small drink. When the\r\nmeal was over every one felt better, and the question of how to get home\r\nwas discussed without any disagreeableness. But no one could think\r\nof any way out of the difficulty, or even out of the tower; for the\r\nPhoenix, though its beak and claws had fortunately been strong enough\r\nto carry food for them, was plainly not equal to flying through the air\r\nwith four well-nourished children.\r\n\r\n\'We must stay here, I suppose,\' said Robert at last, \'and shout out\r\nevery now and then, and some one will hear us and bring ropes and\r\nladders, and rescue us like out of mines; and they\'ll get up a\r\nsubscription to send us home, like castaways.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes; but we shan\'t be home before mother is, and then father\'ll take\r\naway the carpet and say it\'s dangerous or something,\' said Cyril.\r\n\r\n\'I DO wish we hadn\'t come,\' said Jane.\r\n\r\nAnd every one else said \'Shut up,\' except Anthea, who suddenly awoke the\r\nPhoenix and said--\r\n\r\n\'Look here, I believe YOU can help us. Oh, I do wish you would!\'\r\n\r\n\'I will help you as far as lies in my power,\' said the Phoenix, at once.\r\n\'What is it you want now?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, we want to get home,\' said every one.\r\n\r\n\'Oh,\' said the Phoenix. \'Ah, hum! Yes. Home, you said? Meaning?\'\r\n\r\n\'Where we live--where we slept last night--where the altar is that your\r\negg was hatched on.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, there!\' said the Phoenix. \'Well, I\'ll do my best.\' It fluttered on\r\nto the carpet and walked up and down for a few minutes in deep thought.\r\nThen it drew itself up proudly.\r\n\r\n\'I CAN help you,\' it said. \'I am almost sure I can help you. Unless I\r\nam grossly deceived I can help you. You won\'t mind my leaving you for an\r\nhour or two?\' and without waiting for a reply it soared up through the\r\ndimness of the tower into the brightness above.\r\n\r\n\'Now,\' said Cyril, firmly, \'it said an hour or two. But I\'ve read\r\nabout captives and people shut up in dungeons and catacombs and things\r\nawaiting release, and I know each moment is an eternity. Those people\r\nalways do something to pass the desperate moments. It\'s no use our\r\ntrying to tame spiders, because we shan\'t have time.\'\r\n\r\n\'I HOPE not,\' said Jane, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\'But we ought to scratch our names on the stones or something.\'\r\n\r\n\'I say, talking of stones,\' said Robert, \'you see that heap of stones\r\nagainst the wall over in that corner. Well, I\'m certain there\'s a hole\r\nin the wall there--and I believe it\'s a door. Yes, look here--the stones\r\nare round like an arch in the wall; and here\'s the hole--it\'s all black\r\ninside.\'\r\n\r\nHe had walked over to the heap as he spoke and climbed up to\r\nit--dislodged the top stone of the heap and uncovered a little dark\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nNext moment every one was helping to pull down the heap of stones, and\r\nvery soon every one threw off its jacket, for it was warm work.\r\n\r\n\'It IS a door,\' said Cyril, wiping his face, \'and not a bad thing\r\neither, if--\'\r\n\r\nHe was going to add \'if anything happens to the Phoenix,\' but he didn\'t\r\nfor fear of frightening Jane. He was not an unkind boy when he had\r\nleisure to think of such things.\r\n\r\nThe arched hole in the wall grew larger and larger. It was very, very\r\nblack, even compared with the sort of twilight at the bottom of the\r\ntower; it grew larger because the children kept pulling off the stones\r\nand throwing them down into another heap. The stones must have been\r\nthere a very long time, for they were covered with moss, and some of\r\nthem were stuck together by it. So it was fairly hard work, as Robert\r\npointed out.\r\n\r\nWhen the hole reached to about halfway between the top of the arch\r\nand the tower, Robert and Cyril let themselves down cautiously on the\r\ninside, and lit matches. How thankful they felt then that they had a\r\nsensible father, who did not forbid them to carry matches, as some boys\'\r\nfathers do. The father of Robert and Cyril only insisted on the matches\r\nbeing of the kind that strike only on the box.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not a door, it\'s a sort of tunnel,\' Robert cried to the girls,\r\nafter the first match had flared up, flickered, and gone out. \'Stand\r\noff--we\'ll push some more stones down!\'\r\n\r\nThey did, amid deep excitement. And now the stone heap was almost\r\ngone--and before them the girls saw the dark archway leading to unknown\r\nthings. All doubts and fears as to getting home were forgotten in this\r\nthrilling moment. It was like Monte Cristo--it was like--\r\n\r\n\'I say,\' cried Anthea, suddenly, \'come out! There\'s always bad air in\r\nplaces that have been shut up. It makes your torches go out, and then\r\nyou die. It\'s called fire-damp, I believe. Come out, I tell you.\'\r\n\r\nThe urgency of her tone actually brought the boys out--and then every\r\none took up its jacket and fanned the dark arch with it, so as to\r\nmake the air fresh inside. When Anthea thought the air inside \'must be\r\nfreshened by now,\' Cyril led the way into the arch.\r\n\r\nThe girls followed, and Robert came last, because Jane refused to tail\r\nthe procession lest \'something\' should come in after her, and catch at\r\nher from behind. Cyril advanced cautiously, lighting match after match,\r\nand peering before him.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a vaulting roof,\' he said, \'and it\'s all stone--all right,\r\nPanther, don\'t keep pulling at my jacket! The air must be all right\r\nbecause of the matches, silly, and there are--look out--there are steps\r\ndown.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, don\'t let\'s go any farther,\' said Jane, in an agony of reluctance\r\n(a very painful thing, by the way, to be in). \'I\'m sure there are\r\nsnakes, or dens of lions, or something. Do let\'s go back, and come some\r\nother time, with candles, and bellows for the fire-damp.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let me get in front of you, then,\' said the stern voice of Robert, from\r\nbehind. \'This is exactly the place for buried treasure, and I\'m going\r\non, anyway; you can stay behind if you like.\'\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, Jane consented to go on.\r\n\r\nSo, very slowly and carefully, the children went down the steps--there\r\nwere seventeen of them--and at the bottom of the steps were more\r\npassages branching four ways, and a sort of low arch on the right-hand\r\nside made Cyril wonder what it could be, for it was too low to be the\r\nbeginning of another passage.\r\n\r\nSo he knelt down and lit a match, and stooping very low he peeped in.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s SOMETHING,\' he said, and reached out his hand. It touched\r\nsomething that felt more like a damp bag of marbles than anything else\r\nthat Cyril had ever touched.\r\n\r\n\'I believe it IS a buried treasure,\' he cried.\r\n\r\nAnd it was; for even as Anthea cried, \'Oh, hurry up, Squirrel--fetch it\r\nout!\' Cyril pulled out a rotting canvas bag--about as big as the paper\r\nones the greengrocer gives you with Barcelona nuts in for sixpence.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s more of it, a lot more,\' he said.\r\n\r\nAs he pulled the rotten bag gave way, and the gold coins ran and span\r\nand jumped and bumped and chinked and clinked on the floor of the dark\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nI wonder what you would say if you suddenly came upon a buried treasure?\r\nWhat Cyril said was, \'Oh, bother--I\'ve burnt my fingers!\' and as he\r\nspoke he dropped the match. \'AND IT WAS THE LAST!\' he added.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of desperate silence. Then Jane began to cry.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t,\' said Anthea, \'don\'t, Pussy--you\'ll exhaust the air if you cry.\r\nWe can get out all right.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Jane, through her sobs, \'and find the Phoenix has come back\r\nand gone away again--because it thought we\'d gone home some other way,\r\nand--Oh, I WISH we hadn\'t come.\'\r\n\r\nEvery one stood quite still--only Anthea cuddled Jane up to her and\r\ntried to wipe her eyes in the dark.\r\n\r\n\'D-DON\'T,\' said Jane; \'that\'s my EAR--I\'m not crying with my ears.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come, let\'s get on out,\' said Robert; but that was not so easy, for no\r\none could remember exactly which way they had come. It is very difficult\r\nto remember things in the dark, unless you have matches with you, and\r\nthen of course it is quite different, even if you don\'t strike one.\r\n\r\nEvery one had come to agree with Jane\'s constant wish--and despair was\r\nmaking the darkness blacker than ever, when quite suddenly the floor\r\nseemed to tip up--and a strong sensation of being in a whirling lift\r\ncame upon every one. All eyes were closed--one\'s eyes always are in the\r\ndark, don\'t you think? When the whirling feeling stopped, Cyril said\r\n\'Earthquakes!\' and they all opened their eyes.\r\n\r\nThey were in their own dingy breakfast-room at home, and oh, how light\r\nand bright and safe and pleasant and altogether delightful it seemed\r\nafter that dark underground tunnel! The carpet lay on the floor, looking\r\nas calm as though it had never been for an excursion in its life. On\r\nthe mantelpiece stood the Phoenix, waiting with an air of modest yet\r\nsterling worth for the thanks of the children.\r\n\r\n\'But how DID you do it?\' they asked, when every one had thanked the\r\nPhoenix again and again.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I just went and got a wish from your friend the Psammead.\'\r\n\r\n\'But how DID you know where to find it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I found that out from the carpet; these wishing creatures always know\r\nall about each other--they\'re so clannish; like the Scots, you know--all\r\nrelated.\'\r\n\r\n\'But, the carpet can\'t talk, can it?\'\r\n\r\n\'No.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then how--\'\r\n\r\n\'How did I get the Psammead\'s address? I tell you I got it from the\r\ncarpet.\'\r\n\r\n\'DID it speak then?\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said the Phoenix, thoughtfully, \'it didn\'t speak, but I gathered\r\nmy information from something in its manner. I was always a singularly\r\nobservant bird.\'\r\n\r\nIt was not till after the cold mutton and the jam tart, as well as the\r\ntea and bread-and-butter, that any one found time to regret the golden\r\ntreasure which had been left scattered on the floor of the underground\r\npassage, and which, indeed, no one had thought of till now, since the\r\nmoment when Cyril burnt his fingers at the flame of the last match.\r\n\r\n\'What owls and goats we were!\' said Robert. \'Look how we\'ve always\r\nwanted treasure--and now--\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind,\' said Anthea, trying as usual to make the best of it.\r\n\'We\'ll go back again and get it all, and then we\'ll give everybody\r\npresents.\'\r\n\r\nMore than a quarter of an hour passed most agreeably in arranging what\r\npresents should be given to whom, and, when the claims of generosity had\r\nbeen satisfied, the talk ran for fifty minutes on what they would buy\r\nfor themselves.\r\n\r\nIt was Cyril who broke in on Robert\'s almost too technical account of\r\nthe motor-car on which he meant to go to and from school--\r\n\r\n\'There!\' he said. \'Dry up. It\'s no good. We can\'t ever go back. We don\'t\r\nknow where it is.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t YOU know?\' Jane asked the Phoenix, wistfully.\r\n\r\n\'Not in the least,\' the Phoenix replied, in a tone of amiable regret.\r\n\r\n\'Then we\'ve lost the treasure,\' said Cyril. And they had.\r\n\r\n\'But we\'ve got the carpet and the Phoenix,\' said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'Excuse me,\' said the bird, with an air of wounded dignity, \'I do SO\r\nHATE to seem to interfere, but surely you MUST mean the Phoenix and the\r\ncarpet?\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. THE QUEEN COOK\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on a Saturday that the children made their first glorious journey\r\non the wishing carpet. Unless you are too young to read at all, you will\r\nknow that the next day must have been Sunday.\r\n\r\nSunday at 18, Camden Terrace, Camden Town, was always a very pretty\r\nday. Father always brought home flowers on Saturday, so that the\r\nbreakfast-table was extra beautiful. In November, of course, the flowers\r\nwere chrysanthemums, yellow and coppery coloured. Then there were always\r\nsausages on toast for breakfast, and these are rapture, after six days\r\nof Kentish Town Road eggs at fourteen a shilling.\r\n\r\nOn this particular Sunday there were fowls for dinner, a kind of food\r\nthat is generally kept for birthdays and grand occasions, and there\r\nwas an angel pudding, when rice and milk and oranges and white icing do\r\ntheir best to make you happy.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner father was very sleepy indeed, because he had been working\r\nhard all the week; but he did not yield to the voice that said, \'Go and\r\nhave an hour\'s rest.\' He nursed the Lamb, who had a horrid cough that\r\ncook said was whooping-cough as sure as eggs, and he said--\r\n\r\n\'Come along, kiddies; I\'ve got a ripping book from the library, called\r\nThe Golden Age, and I\'ll read it to you.\'\r\n\r\nMother settled herself on the drawing-room sofa, and said she could\r\nlisten quite nicely with her eyes shut. The Lamb snugged into the\r\n\'armchair corner\' of daddy\'s arm, and the others got into a happy heap\r\non the hearth-rug. At first, of course, there were too many feet and\r\nknees and shoulders and elbows, but real comfort was actually settling\r\ndown on them, and the Phoenix and the carpet were put away on the back\r\ntop shelf of their minds (beautiful things that could be taken out and\r\nplayed with later), when a surly solid knock came at the drawing-room\r\ndoor. It opened an angry inch, and the cook\'s voice said, \'Please, m\',\r\nmay I speak to you a moment?\'\r\n\r\nMother looked at father with a desperate expression. Then she put her\r\npretty sparkly Sunday shoes down from the sofa, and stood up in them and\r\nsighed.\r\n\r\n\'As good fish in the sea,\' said father, cheerfully, and it was not till\r\nmuch later that the children understood what he meant.\r\n\r\nMother went out into the passage, which is called \'the hall\', where the\r\numbrella-stand is, and the picture of the \'Monarch of the Glen\' in a\r\nyellow shining frame, with brown spots on the Monarch from the damp\r\nin the house before last, and there was cook, very red and damp in the\r\nface, and with a clean apron tied on all crooked over the dirty one that\r\nshe had dished up those dear delightful chickens in. She stood there and\r\nshe seemed to get redder and damper, and she twisted the corner of her\r\napron round her fingers, and she said very shortly and fiercely--\r\n\r\n\'If you please ma\'am, I should wish to leave at my day month.\' Mother\r\nleaned against the hatstand. The children could see her looking pale\r\nthrough the crack of the door, because she had been very kind to the\r\ncook, and had given her a holiday only the day before, and it seemed so\r\nvery unkind of the cook to want to go like this, and on a Sunday too.\r\n\r\n\'Why, what\'s the matter?\' mother said.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s them children,\' the cook replied, and somehow the children all\r\nfelt that they had known it from the first. They did not remember having\r\ndone anything extra wrong, but it is so frightfully easy to displease a\r\ncook. \'It\'s them children: there\'s that there new carpet in their room,\r\ncovered thick with mud, both sides, beastly yellow mud, and sakes alive\r\nknows where they got it. And all that muck to clean up on a Sunday! It\'s\r\nnot my place, and it\'s not my intentions, so I don\'t deceive you, ma\'am,\r\nand but for them limbs, which they is if ever there was, it\'s not a bad\r\nplace, though I says it, and I wouldn\'t wish to leave, but--\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m very sorry,\' said mother, gently. \'I will speak to the children.\r\nAnd you had better think it over, and if you REALLY wish to go, tell me\r\nto-morrow.\'\r\n\r\nNext day mother had a quiet talk with cook, and cook said she didn\'t\r\nmind if she stayed on a bit, just to see.\r\n\r\nBut meantime the question of the muddy carpet had been gone into\r\nthoroughly by father and mother. Jane\'s candid explanation that the\r\nmud had come from the bottom of a foreign tower where there was buried\r\ntreasure was received with such chilling disbelief that the others\r\nlimited their defence to an expression of sorrow, and of a determination\r\n\'not to do it again\'. But father said (and mother agreed with him,\r\nbecause mothers have to agree with fathers, and not because it was her\r\nown idea) that children who coated a carpet on both sides with thick\r\nmud, and when they were asked for an explanation could only talk silly\r\nnonsense--that meant Jane\'s truthful statement--were not fit to have a\r\ncarpet at all, and, indeed, SHOULDN\'T have one for a week!\r\n\r\nSo the carpet was brushed (with tea-leaves, too) which was the only\r\ncomfort Anthea could think of, and folded up and put away in the\r\ncupboard at the top of the stairs, and daddy put the key in his trousers\r\npocket. \'Till Saturday,\' said he.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind,\' said Anthea, \'we\'ve got the Phoenix.\'\r\n\r\nBut, as it happened, they hadn\'t. The Phoenix was nowhere to be found,\r\nand everything had suddenly settled down from the rosy wild beauty of\r\nmagic happenings to the common damp brownness of ordinary November life\r\nin Camden Town--and there was the nursery floor all bare boards in\r\nthe middle and brown oilcloth round the outside, and the bareness and\r\nyellowness of the middle floor showed up the blackbeetles with terrible\r\ndistinctness, when the poor things came out in the evening, as usual, to\r\ntry to make friends with the children. But the children never would.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday ended in gloom, which even junket for supper in the blue\r\nDresden bowl could hardly lighten at all. Next day the Lamb\'s cough\r\nwas worse. It certainly seemed very whoopy, and the doctor came in his\r\nbrougham carriage.\r\n\r\nEvery one tried to bear up under the weight of the sorrow which it was\r\nto know that the wishing carpet was locked up and the Phoenix mislaid. A\r\ngood deal of time was spent in looking for the Phoenix.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a bird of its word,\' said Anthea. \'I\'m sure it\'s not deserted us.\r\nBut you know it had a most awfully long fly from wherever it was to near\r\nRochester and back, and I expect the poor thing\'s feeling tired out and\r\nwants rest. I am sure we may trust it.\'\r\n\r\nThe others tried to feel sure of this, too, but it was hard.\r\n\r\nNo one could be expected to feel very kindly towards the cook, since it\r\nwas entirely through her making such a fuss about a little foreign mud\r\nthat the carpet had been taken away.\r\n\r\n\'She might have told us,\' said Jane, \'and Panther and I would have\r\ncleaned it with tea-leaves.\'\r\n\r\n\'She\'s a cantankerous cat,\' said Robert.\r\n\r\n\'I shan\'t say what I think about her,\' said Anthea, primly, \'because it\r\nwould be evil speaking, lying, and slandering.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not lying to say she\'s a disagreeable pig, and a beastly\r\nblue-nosed Bozwoz,\' said Cyril, who had read The Eyes of Light, and\r\nintended to talk like Tony as soon as he could teach Robert to talk like\r\nPaul.\r\n\r\nAnd all the children, even Anthea, agreed that even if she wasn\'t a\r\nblue-nosed Bozwoz, they wished cook had never been born.\r\n\r\nBut I ask you to believe that they didn\'t do all the things on purpose\r\nwhich so annoyed the cook during the following week, though I daresay\r\nthe things would not have happened if the cook had been a favourite.\r\nThis is a mystery. Explain it if you can. The things that had happened\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\nSunday.--Discovery of foreign mud on both sides of the carpet.\r\n\r\nMonday.--Liquorice put on to boil with aniseed balls in a saucepan.\r\nAnthea did this, because she thought it would be good for the Lamb\'s\r\ncough. The whole thing forgotten, and bottom of saucepan burned out. It\r\nwas the little saucepan lined with white that was kept for the baby\'s\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nTuesday.--A dead mouse found in pantry. Fish-slice taken to dig grave\r\nwith. By regrettable accident fish-slice broken. Defence: \'The cook\r\noughtn\'t to keep dead mice in pantries.\'\r\n\r\nWednesday.--Chopped suet left on kitchen table. Robert added chopped\r\nsoap, but he says he thought the suet was soap too.\r\n\r\nThursday.--Broke the kitchen window by falling against it during a\r\nperfectly fair game of bandits in the area.\r\n\r\nFriday.--Stopped up grating of kitchen sink with putty and filled sink\r\nwith water to make a lake to sail paper boats in. Went away and left the\r\ntap running. Kitchen hearthrug and cook\'s shoes ruined.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday the carpet was restored. There had been plenty of time\r\nduring the week to decide where it should be asked to go when they did\r\nget it back.\r\n\r\nMother had gone over to granny\'s, and had not taken the Lamb because he\r\nhad a bad cough, which, cook repeatedly said, was whooping-cough as sure\r\nas eggs is eggs.\r\n\r\n\'But we\'ll take him out, a ducky darling,\' said Anthea. \'We\'ll take\r\nhim somewhere where you can\'t have whooping-cough. Don\'t be so silly,\r\nRobert. If he DOES talk about it no one\'ll take any notice. He\'s always\r\ntalking about things he\'s never seen.\'\r\n\r\nSo they dressed the Lamb and themselves in out-of-doors clothes, and the\r\nLamb chuckled and coughed, and laughed and coughed again, poor dear, and\r\nall the chairs and tables were moved off the carpet by the boys, while\r\nJane nursed the Lamb, and Anthea rushed through the house in one last\r\nwild hunt for the missing Phoenix.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s no use waiting for it,\' she said, reappearing breathless in the\r\nbreakfast-room. \'But I know it hasn\'t deserted us. It\'s a bird of its\r\nword.\'\r\n\r\n\'Quite so,\' said the gentle voice of the Phoenix from beneath the table.\r\n\r\nEvery one fell on its knees and looked up, and there was the Phoenix\r\nperched on a crossbar of wood that ran across under the table, and had\r\nonce supported a drawer, in the happy days before the drawer had been\r\nused as a boat, and its bottom unfortunately trodden out by Raggett\'s\r\nReally Reliable School Boots on the feet of Robert.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve been here all the time,\' said the Phoenix, yawning politely\r\nbehind its claw. \'If you wanted me you should have recited the ode of\r\ninvocation; it\'s seven thousand lines long, and written in very pure and\r\nbeautiful Greek.\'\r\n\r\n\'Couldn\'t you tell it us in English?\' asked Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s rather long, isn\'t it?\' said Jane, jumping the Lamb on her knee.\r\n\r\n\'Couldn\'t you make a short English version, like Tate and Brady?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, come along, do,\' said Robert, holding out his hand. \'Come along,\r\ngood old Phoenix.\'\r\n\r\n\'Good old BEAUTIFUL Phoenix,\' it corrected shyly.\r\n\r\n\'Good old BEAUTIFUL Phoenix, then. Come along, come along,\' said Robert,\r\nimpatiently, with his hand still held out.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix fluttered at once on to his wrist.\r\n\r\n\'This amiable youth,\' it said to the others, \'has miraculously been able\r\nto put the whole meaning of the seven thousand lines of Greek invocation\r\ninto one English hexameter--a little misplaced some of the words--but--\r\n\r\n\'Oh, come along, come along, good old beautiful Phoenix!\'\r\n\r\n\'Not perfect, I admit--but not bad for a boy of his age.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, now then,\' said Robert, stepping back on to the carpet with the\r\ngolden Phoenix on his wrist.\r\n\r\n\'You look like the king\'s falconer,\' said Jane, sitting down on the\r\ncarpet with the baby on her lap.\r\n\r\nRobert tried to go on looking like it. Cyril and Anthea stood on the\r\ncarpet.\r\n\r\n\'We shall have to get back before dinner,\' said Cyril, \'or cook will\r\nblow the gaff.\'\r\n\r\n\'She hasn\'t sneaked since Sunday,\' said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'She--\' Robert was beginning, when the door burst open and the cook,\r\nfierce and furious, came in like a whirlwind and stood on the corner of\r\nthe carpet, with a broken basin in one hand and a threat in the other,\r\nwhich was clenched.\r\n\r\n\'Look \'ere!\' she cried, \'my only basin; and what the powers am I to\r\nmake the beefsteak and kidney pudding in that your ma ordered for your\r\ndinners? You don\'t deserve no dinners, so yer don\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m awfully sorry, cook,\' said Anthea gently; \'it was my fault, and\r\nI forgot to tell you about it. It got broken when we were telling our\r\nfortunes with melted lead, you know, and I meant to tell you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Meant to tell me,\' replied the cook; she was red with anger, and really\r\nI don\'t wonder--\'meant to tell! Well, _I_ mean to tell, too. I\'ve held\r\nmy tongue this week through, because the missus she said to me quiet\r\nlike, "We mustn\'t expect old heads on young shoulders," but now I shan\'t\r\nhold it no longer. There was the soap you put in our pudding, and me and\r\nEliza never so much as breathed it to your ma--though well we might--and\r\nthe saucepan, and the fish-slice, and--My gracious cats alive! what \'ave\r\nyou got that blessed child dressed up in his outdoors for?\'\r\n\r\n\'We aren\'t going to take him out,\' said Anthea; \'at least--\' She stopped\r\nshort, for though they weren\'t going to take him out in the Kentish\r\nTown Road, they certainly intended to take him elsewhere. But not at all\r\nwhere cook meant when she said \'out\'. This confused the truthful Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'Out!\' said the cook, \'that I\'ll take care you don\'t;\' and she snatched\r\nthe Lamb from the lap of Jane, while Anthea and Robert caught her by the\r\nskirts and apron. \'Look here,\' said Cyril, in stern desperation, \'will\r\nyou go away, and make your pudding in a pie-dish, or a flower-pot, or a\r\nhot-water can, or something?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not me,\' said the cook, briefly; \'and leave this precious poppet for\r\nyou to give his deathercold to.\'\r\n\r\n\'I warn you,\' said Cyril, solemnly. \'Beware, ere yet it be too late.\'\r\n\r\n\'Late yourself the little popsey-wopsey,\' said the cook, with angry\r\ntenderness. \'They shan\'t take it out, no more they shan\'t. And--Where\r\ndid you get that there yellow fowl?\' She pointed to the Phoenix.\r\n\r\nEven Anthea saw that unless the cook lost her situation the loss would\r\nbe theirs.\r\n\r\n\'I wish,\' she said suddenly, \'we were on a sunny southern shore, where\r\nthere can\'t be any whooping-cough.\'\r\n\r\nShe said it through the frightened howls of the Lamb, and the sturdy\r\nscoldings of the cook, and instantly the giddy-go-round-and-falling-lift\r\nfeeling swept over the whole party, and the cook sat down flat on the\r\ncarpet, holding the screaming Lamb tight to her stout print-covered\r\nself, and calling on St Bridget to help her. She was an Irishwoman.\r\n\r\nThe moment the tipsy-topsy-turvy feeling stopped, the cook opened her\r\neyes, gave one sounding screech and shut them again, and Anthea took the\r\nopportunity to get the desperately howling Lamb into her own arms.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s all right,\' she said; \'own Panther\'s got you. Look at the trees,\r\nand the sand, and the shells, and the great big tortoises. Oh DEAR, how\r\nhot it is!\'\r\n\r\nIt certainly was; for the trusty carpet had laid itself out on a\r\nsouthern shore that was sunny and no mistake, as Robert remarked. The\r\ngreenest of green slopes led up to glorious groves where palm-trees and\r\nall the tropical flowers and fruits that you read of in Westward Ho! and\r\nFair Play were growing in rich profusion. Between the green, green slope\r\nand the blue, blue sea lay a stretch of sand that looked like a carpet\r\nof jewelled cloth of gold, for it was not greyish as our northern sand\r\nis, but yellow and changing--opal-coloured like sunshine and rainbows.\r\nAnd at the very moment when the wild, whirling, blinding, deafening,\r\ntumbling upside-downness of the carpet-moving stopped, the children had\r\nthe happiness of seeing three large live turtles waddle down to the edge\r\nof the sea and disappear in the water. And it was hotter than you can\r\npossibly imagine, unless you think of ovens on a baking-day.\r\n\r\nEvery one without an instant\'s hesitation tore off its\r\nLondon-in-November outdoor clothes, and Anthea took off the Lamb\'s\r\nhighwayman blue coat and his three-cornered hat, and then his jersey,\r\nand then the Lamb himself suddenly slipped out of his little blue tight\r\nbreeches and stood up happy and hot in his little white shirt.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure it\'s much warmer than the seaside in the summer,\' said Anthea.\r\n\'Mother always lets us go barefoot then.\'\r\n\r\nSo the Lamb\'s shoes and socks and gaiters came off, and he stood digging\r\nhis happy naked pink toes into the golden smooth sand.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m a little white duck-dickie,\' said he--\'a little white duck-dickie\r\nwhat swims,\' and splashed quacking into a sandy pool.\r\n\r\n\'Let him,\' said Anthea; \'it can\'t hurt him. Oh, how hot it is!\'\r\n\r\nThe cook suddenly opened her eyes and screamed, shut them, screamed\r\nagain, opened her eyes once more and said--\r\n\r\n\'Why, drat my cats alive, what\'s all this? It\'s a dream, I expect.\r\n\r\nWell, it\'s the best I ever dreamed. I\'ll look it up in the dream-book\r\nto-morrow. Seaside and trees and a carpet to sit on. I never did!\'\r\n\r\n\'Look here,\' said Cyril, \'it isn\'t a dream; it\'s real.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ho yes!\' said the cook; \'they always says that in dreams.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s REAL, I tell you,\' Robert said, stamping his foot. \'I\'m not going\r\nto tell you how it\'s done, because that\'s our secret.\' He winked heavily\r\nat each of the others in turn. \'But you wouldn\'t go away and make that\r\npudding, so we HAD to bring you, and I hope you like it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I do that, and no mistake,\' said the cook unexpectedly; \'and it being a\r\ndream it don\'t matter what I say; and I WILL say, if it\'s my last word,\r\nthat of all the aggravating little varmints--\' \'Calm yourself, my good\r\nwoman,\' said the Phoenix.\r\n\r\n\'Good woman, indeed,\' said the cook; \'good woman yourself\' Then she\r\nsaw who it was that had spoken. \'Well, if I ever,\' said she; \'this is\r\nsomething like a dream! Yellow fowls a-talking and all! I\'ve heard of\r\nsuch, but never did I think to see the day.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, then,\' said Cyril, impatiently, \'sit here and see the day now.\r\nIt\'s a jolly fine day. Here, you others--a council!\' They walked along\r\nthe shore till they were out of earshot of the cook, who still sat\r\ngazing about her with a happy, dreamy, vacant smile.\r\n\r\n\'Look here,\' said Cyril, \'we must roll the carpet up and hide it, so\r\nthat we can get at it at any moment. The Lamb can be getting rid of\r\nhis whooping-cough all the morning, and we can look about; and if the\r\nsavages on this island are cannibals, we\'ll hook it, and take her back.\r\nAnd if not, we\'ll LEAVE HER HERE.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is that being kind to servants and animals, like the clergyman said?\'\r\nasked Jane.\r\n\r\n\'Nor she isn\'t kind,\' retorted Cyril.\r\n\r\n\'Well--anyway,\' said Anthea, \'the safest thing is to leave the carpet\r\nthere with her sitting on it. Perhaps it\'ll be a lesson to her, and\r\nanyway, if she thinks it\'s a dream it won\'t matter what she says when\r\nshe gets home.\'\r\n\r\nSo the extra coats and hats and mufflers were piled on the carpet. Cyril\r\nshouldered the well and happy Lamb, the Phoenix perched on Robert\'s\r\nwrist, and \'the party of explorers prepared to enter the interior\'.\r\n\r\nThe grassy slope was smooth, but under the trees there were tangled\r\ncreepers with bright, strange-shaped flowers, and it was not easy to\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\n\'We ought to have an explorer\'s axe,\' said Robert. \'I shall ask father\r\nto give me one for Christmas.\'\r\n\r\nThere were curtains of creepers with scented blossoms hanging from the\r\ntrees, and brilliant birds darted about quite close to their faces.\r\n\r\n\'Now, tell me honestly,\' said the Phoenix, \'are there any birds here\r\nhandsomer than I am? Don\'t be afraid of hurting my feelings--I\'m a\r\nmodest bird, I hope.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not one of them,\' said Robert, with conviction, \'is a patch upon you!\'\r\n\r\n\'I was never a vain bird,\' said the Phoenix, \'but I own that you confirm\r\nmy own impression. I will take a flight.\' It circled in the air for a\r\nmoment, and, returning to Robert\'s wrist, went on, \'There is a path to\r\nthe left.\'\r\n\r\nAnd there was. So now the children went on through the wood more quickly\r\nand comfortably, the girls picking flowers and the Lamb inviting\r\nthe \'pretty dickies\' to observe that he himself was a \'little white\r\nreal-water-wet duck!\'\r\n\r\nAnd all this time he hadn\'t whooping-coughed once.\r\n\r\nThe path turned and twisted, and, always threading their way amid a\r\ntangle of flowers, the children suddenly passed a corner and found\r\nthemselves in a forest clearing, where there were a lot of pointed\r\nhuts--the huts, as they knew at once, of SAVAGES.\r\n\r\nThe boldest heart beat more quickly. Suppose they WERE cannibals. It was\r\na long way back to the carpet.\r\n\r\n\'Hadn\'t we better go back?\' said Jane. \'Go NOW,\' she said, and her voice\r\ntrembled a little. \'Suppose they eat us.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense, Pussy,\' said Cyril, firmly. \'Look, there\'s a goat tied up.\r\nThat shows they don\'t eat PEOPLE.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s go on and say we\'re missionaries,\' Robert suggested.\r\n\r\n\'I shouldn\'t advise THAT,\' said the Phoenix, very earnestly.\r\n\r\n\'Why not?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, for one thing, it isn\'t true,\' replied the golden bird.\r\n\r\nIt was while they stood hesitating on the edge of the clearing that\r\na tall man suddenly came out of one of the huts. He had hardly any\r\nclothes, and his body all over was a dark and beautiful coppery\r\ncolour--just like the chrysanthemums father had brought home on\r\nSaturday. In his hand he held a spear. The whites of his eyes and the\r\nwhite of his teeth were the only light things about him, except that\r\nwhere the sun shone on his shiny brown body it looked white, too. If\r\nyou will look carefully at the next shiny savage you meet with next to\r\nnothing on, you will see at once--if the sun happens to be shining at\r\nthe time--that I am right about this.\r\n\r\nThe savage looked at the children. Concealment was impossible. He\r\nuttered a shout that was more like \'Oo goggery bag-wag\' than anything\r\nelse the children had ever heard, and at once brown coppery people leapt\r\nout of every hut, and swarmed like ants about the clearing. There was\r\nno time for discussion, and no one wanted to discuss anything, anyhow.\r\nWhether these coppery people were cannibals or not now seemed to matter\r\nvery little.\r\n\r\nWithout an instant\'s hesitation the four children turned and ran back\r\nalong the forest path; the only pause was Anthea\'s. She stood back to\r\nlet Cyril pass, because he was carrying the Lamb, who screamed with\r\ndelight. (He had not whooping-coughed a single once since the carpet\r\nlanded him on the island.)\r\n\r\n\'Gee-up, Squirrel; gee-gee,\' he shouted, and Cyril did gee-up. The path\r\nwas a shorter cut to the beach than the creeper-covered way by which\r\nthey had come, and almost directly they saw through the trees the\r\nshining blue-and-gold-and-opal of sand and sea.\r\n\r\n\'Stick to it,\' cried Cyril, breathlessly.\r\n\r\nThey did stick to it; they tore down the sands--they could hear behind\r\nthem as they ran the patter of feet which they knew, too well, were\r\ncopper-coloured.\r\n\r\nThe sands were golden and opal-coloured--and BARE. There were wreaths of\r\ntropic seaweed, there were rich tropic shells of the kind you would not\r\nbuy in the Kentish Town Road under at least fifteen pence a pair.\r\nThere were turtles basking lumpily on the water\'s edge--but no cook, no\r\nclothes, and no carpet.\r\n\r\n\'On, on! Into the sea!\' gasped Cyril. \'They MUST hate water.\r\nI\'ve--heard--savages always--dirty.\'\r\n\r\nTheir feet were splashing in the warm shallows before his breathless\r\nwords were ended. The calm baby-waves were easy to go through. It is\r\nwarm work running for your life in the tropics, and the coolness of the\r\nwater was delicious. They were up to their arm-pits now, and Jane was up\r\nto her chin.\r\n\r\n\'Look!\' said the Phoenix. \'What are they pointing at?\'\r\n\r\nThe children turned; and there, a little to the west was a head--a head\r\nthey knew, with a crooked cap upon it. It was the head of the cook.\r\n\r\nFor some reason or other the savages had stopped at the water\'s edge\r\nand were all talking at the top of their voices, and all were pointing\r\ncopper-coloured fingers, stiff with interest and excitement, at the head\r\nof the cook.\r\n\r\nThe children hurried towards her as quickly as the water would let them.\r\n\r\n\'What on earth did you come out here for?\' Robert shouted; \'and where on\r\nearth\'s the carpet?\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not on earth, bless you,\' replied the cook, happily; \'it\'s UNDER\r\nME--in the water. I got a bit warm setting there in the sun, and I just\r\nsays, "I wish I was in a cold bath"--just like that--and next minute\r\nhere I was! It\'s all part of the dream.\'\r\n\r\nEvery one at once saw how extremely fortunate it was that the carpet had\r\nhad the sense to take the cook to the nearest and largest bath--the sea,\r\nand how terrible it would have been if the carpet had taken itself and\r\nher to the stuffy little bath-room of the house in Camden Town!\r\n\r\n\'Excuse me,\' said the Phoenix\'s soft voice, breaking in on the general\r\nsigh of relief, \'but I think these brown people want your cook.\'\r\n\r\n\'To--to eat?\' whispered Jane, as well as she could through the water\r\nwhich the plunging Lamb was dashing in her face with happy fat hands and\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\'Hardly,\' rejoined the bird. \'Who wants cooks to EAT? Cooks are ENGAGED,\r\nnot eaten. They wish to engage her.\'\r\n\r\n\'How can you understand what they say?\' asked Cyril, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s as easy as kissing your claw,\' replied the bird. \'I speak and\r\nunderstand ALL languages, even that of your cook, which is difficult and\r\nunpleasing. It\'s quite easy, when you know how it\'s done. It just comes\r\nto you. I should advise you to beach the carpet and land the cargo--the\r\ncook, I mean. You can take my word for it, the copper-coloured ones will\r\nnot harm you now.\'\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to take the word of a Phoenix when it tells you\r\nto. So the children at once got hold of the corners of the carpet,\r\nand, pulling it from under the cook, towed it slowly in through the\r\nshallowing water, and at last spread it on the sand. The cook, who had\r\nfollowed, instantly sat down on it, and at once the copper-coloured\r\nnatives, now strangely humble, formed a ring round the carpet, and fell\r\non their faces on the rainbow-and-gold sand. The tallest savage spoke\r\nin this position, which must have been very awkward for him; and Jane\r\nnoticed that it took him quite a long time to get the sand out of his\r\nmouth afterwards.\r\n\r\n\'He says,\' the Phoenix remarked after some time, \'that they wish to\r\nengage your cook permanently.\'\r\n\r\n\'Without a character?\' asked Anthea, who had heard her mother speak of\r\nsuch things.\r\n\r\n\'They do not wish to engage her as cook, but as queen; and queens need\r\nnot have characters.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a breathless pause.\r\n\r\n\'WELL,\' said Cyril, \'of all the choices! But there\'s no accounting for\r\ntastes.\'\r\n\r\nEvery one laughed at the idea of the cook\'s being engaged as queen; they\r\ncould not help it.\r\n\r\n\'I do not advise laughter,\' warned the Phoenix, ruffling out his golden\r\nfeathers, which were extremely wet. \'And it\'s not their own choice. It\r\nseems that there is an ancient prophecy of this copper-coloured tribe\r\nthat a great queen should some day arise out of the sea with a white\r\ncrown on her head, and--and--well, you see! There\'s the crown!\'\r\n\r\nIt pointed its claw at cook\'s cap; and a very dirty cap it was, because\r\nit was the end of the week.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s the white crown,\' it said; \'at least, it\'s nearly white--very\r\nwhite indeed compared to the colour THEY are--and anyway, it\'s quite\r\nwhite enough.\'\r\n\r\nCyril addressed the cook. \'Look here!\' said he, \'these brown people want\r\nyou to be their queen. They\'re only savages, and they don\'t know any\r\nbetter. Now would you really like to stay? or, if you\'ll promise not to\r\nbe so jolly aggravating at home, and not to tell any one a word about\r\nto-day, we\'ll take you back to Camden Town.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, you don\'t,\' said the cook, in firm, undoubting tones. \'I\'ve always\r\nwanted to be the Queen, God bless her! and I always thought what a good\r\none I should make; and now I\'m going to. IF it\'s only in a dream, it\'s\r\nwell worth while. And I don\'t go back to that nasty underground kitchen,\r\nand me blamed for everything; that I don\'t, not till the dream\'s\r\nfinished and I wake up with that nasty bell a rang-tanging in my\r\nears--so I tell you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Are you SURE,\' Anthea anxiously asked the Phoenix, \'that she will be\r\nquite safe here?\'\r\n\r\n\'She will find the nest of a queen a very precious and soft thing,\' said\r\nthe bird, solemnly.\r\n\r\n\'There--you hear,\' said Cyril. \'You\'re in for a precious soft thing,\r\nso mind you\'re a good queen, cook. It\'s more than you\'d any right to\r\nexpect, but long may you reign.\'\r\n\r\nSome of the cook\'s copper-coloured subjects now advanced from the forest\r\nwith long garlands of beautiful flowers, white and sweet-scented, and\r\nhung them respectfully round the neck of their new sovereign.\r\n\r\n\'What! all them lovely bokays for me!\' exclaimed the enraptured cook.\r\n\'Well, this here is something LIKE a dream, I must say.\'\r\n\r\nShe sat up very straight on the carpet, and the copper-coloured ones,\r\nthemselves wreathed in garlands of the gayest flowers, madly stuck\r\nparrot feathers in their hair and began to dance. It was a dance such as\r\nyou have never seen; it made the children feel almost sure that the\r\ncook was right, and that they were all in a dream. Small, strange-shaped\r\ndrums were beaten, odd-sounding songs were sung, and the dance got\r\nfaster and faster and odder and odder, till at last all the dancers fell\r\non the sand tired out.\r\n\r\nThe new queen, with her white crown-cap all on one side, clapped wildly.\r\n\r\n\'Brayvo!\' she cried, \'brayvo! It\'s better than the Albert Edward\r\nMusic-hall in the Kentish Town Road. Go it again!\'\r\n\r\nBut the Phoenix would not translate this request into the\r\ncopper-coloured language; and when the savages had recovered their\r\nbreath, they implored their queen to leave her white escort and come\r\nwith them to their huts.\r\n\r\n\'The finest shall be yours, O queen,\' said they.\r\n\r\n\'Well--so long!\' said the cook, getting heavily on to her feet, when the\r\nPhoenix had translated this request. \'No more kitchens and attics for\r\nme, thank you. I\'m off to my royal palace, I am; and I only wish this\r\nhere dream would keep on for ever and ever.\'\r\n\r\nShe picked up the ends of the garlands that trailed round her feet,\r\nand the children had one last glimpse of her striped stockings and worn\r\nelastic-side boots before she disappeared into the shadow of the forest,\r\nsurrounded by her dusky retainers, singing songs of rejoicing as they\r\nwent.\r\n\r\n\'WELL!\' said Cyril, \'I suppose she\'s all right, but they don\'t seem to\r\ncount us for much, one way or the other.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh,\' said the Phoenix, \'they think you\'re merely dreams. The prophecy\r\nsaid that the queen would arise from the waves with a white crown and\r\nsurrounded by white dream-children. That\'s about what they think YOU\r\nare!\'\r\n\r\n\'And what about dinner?\' said Robert, abruptly.\r\n\r\n\'There won\'t be any dinner, with no cook and no pudding-basin,\' Anthea\r\nreminded him; \'but there\'s always bread-and-butter.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s get home,\' said Cyril.\r\n\r\nThe Lamb was furiously unwishful to be dressed in his warm clothes\r\nagain, but Anthea and Jane managed it, by force disguised as coaxing,\r\nand he never once whooping-coughed.\r\n\r\nThen every one put on its own warm things and took its place on the\r\ncarpet.\r\n\r\nA sound of uncouth singing still came from beyond the trees where the\r\ncopper-coloured natives were crooning songs of admiration and respect\r\nto their white-crowned queen. Then Anthea said \'Home,\' just as duchesses\r\nand other people do to their coachmen, and the intelligent carpet in\r\none whirling moment laid itself down in its proper place on the nursery\r\nfloor. And at that very moment Eliza opened the door and said--\r\n\r\n\'Cook\'s gone! I can\'t find her anywhere, and there\'s no dinner ready.\r\nShe hasn\'t taken her box nor yet her outdoor things. She just ran out to\r\nsee the time, I shouldn\'t wonder--the kitchen clock never did give her\r\nsatisfaction--and she\'s got run over or fell down in a fit as likely\r\nas not. You\'ll have to put up with the cold bacon for your dinners; and\r\nwhat on earth you\'ve got your outdoor things on for I don\'t know.\r\nAnd then I\'ll slip out and see if they know anything about her at the\r\npolice-station.\'\r\n\r\nBut nobody ever knew anything about the cook any more, except the\r\nchildren, and, later, one other person.\r\n\r\n\r\nMother was so upset at losing the cook, and so anxious about her, that\r\nAnthea felt most miserable, as though she had done something very wrong\r\nindeed. She woke several times in the night, and at last decided that\r\nshe would ask the Phoenix to let her tell her mother all about it. But\r\nthere was no opportunity to do this next day, because the Phoenix, as\r\nusual, had gone to sleep in some out-of-the-way spot, after asking, as a\r\nspecial favour, not to be disturbed for twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe Lamb never whooping-coughed once all that Sunday, and mother and\r\nfather said what good medicine it was that the doctor had given him. But\r\nthe children knew that it was the southern shore where you can\'t have\r\nwhooping-cough that had cured him. The Lamb babbled of coloured sand\r\nand water, but no one took any notice of that. He often talked of things\r\nthat hadn\'t happened.\r\n\r\nIt was on Monday morning, very early indeed, that Anthea woke and\r\nsuddenly made up her mind. She crept downstairs in her night-gown (it\r\nwas very chilly), sat down on the carpet, and with a beating heart\r\nwished herself on the sunny shore where you can\'t have whooping-cough,\r\nand next moment there she was.\r\n\r\nThe sand was splendidly warm. She could feel it at once, even through\r\nthe carpet. She folded the carpet, and put it over her shoulders like\r\na shawl, for she was determined not to be parted from it for a single\r\ninstant, no matter how hot it might be to wear.\r\n\r\nThen trembling a little, and trying to keep up her courage by saying\r\nover and over, \'It is my DUTY, it IS my duty,\' she went up the forest\r\npath.\r\n\r\n\'Well, here you are again,\' said the cook, directly she saw Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'This dream does keep on!\'\r\n\r\nThe cook was dressed in a white robe; she had no shoes and stockings\r\nand no cap and she was sitting under a screen of palm-leaves, for it was\r\nafternoon in the island, and blazing hot. She wore a flower wreath\r\non her hair, and copper-coloured boys were fanning her with peacock\'s\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\n\'They\'ve got the cap put away,\' she said. \'They seem to think a lot of\r\nit. Never saw one before, I expect.\'\r\n\r\n\'Are you happy?\' asked Anthea, panting; the sight of the cook as queen\r\nquite took her breath away.\r\n\r\n\'I believe you, my dear,\' said the cook, heartily. \'Nothing to do unless\r\nyou want to. But I\'m getting rested now. Tomorrow I\'m going to start\r\ncleaning out my hut, if the dream keeps on, and I shall teach them\r\ncooking; they burns everything to a cinder now unless they eats it raw.\'\r\n\r\n\'But can you talk to them?\'\r\n\r\n\'Lor\' love a duck, yes!\' the happy cook-queen replied; \'it\'s quite easy\r\nto pick up. I always thought I should be quick at foreign languages.\r\nI\'ve taught them to understand "dinner," and "I want a drink," and "You\r\nleave me be," already.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you don\'t want anything?\' Anthea asked earnestly and anxiously.\r\n\r\n\'Not me, miss; except if you\'d only go away. I\'m afraid of me waking\r\nup with that bell a-going if you keep on stopping here a-talking to me.\r\nLong as this here dream keeps up I\'m as happy as a queen.\'\r\n\r\n\'Goodbye, then,\' said Anthea, gaily, for her conscience was clear now.\r\n\r\nShe hurried into the wood, threw herself on the ground, and said\r\n\'Home\'--and there she was, rolled in the carpet on the nursery floor.\r\n\r\n\'SHE\'S all right, anyhow,\' said Anthea, and went back to bed. \'I\'m glad\r\nsomebody\'s pleased. But mother will never believe me when I tell her.\'\r\n\r\nThe story is indeed a little difficult to believe. Still, you might try.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. TWO BAZAARS\r\n\r\n\r\nMother was really a great dear. She was pretty and she was loving, and\r\nmost frightfully good when you were ill, and always kind, and almost\r\nalways just. That is, she was just when she understood things. But\r\nof course she did not always understand things. No one understands\r\neverything, and mothers are not angels, though a good many of them come\r\npretty near it. The children knew that mother always WANTED to do what\r\nwas best for them, even if she was not clever enough to know exactly\r\nwhat was the best. That was why all of them, but much more particularly\r\nAnthea, felt rather uncomfortable at keeping the great secret from her\r\nof the wishing carpet and the Phoenix. And Anthea, whose inside mind was\r\nmade so that she was able to be much more uncomfortable than the others,\r\nhad decided that she MUST tell her mother the truth, however little\r\nlikely it was that her mother would believe it.\r\n\r\n\'Then I shall have done what\'s right,\' said she to the Phoenix; \'and if\r\nshe doesn\'t believe me it won\'t be my fault--will it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not in the least,\' said the golden bird. \'And she won\'t, so you\'re\r\nquite safe.\'\r\n\r\nAnthea chose a time when she was doing her home-lessons--they were\r\nAlgebra and Latin, German, English, and Euclid--and she asked her mother\r\nwhether she might come and do them in the drawing-room--\'so as to be\r\nquiet,\' she said to her mother; and to herself she said, \'And that\'s not\r\nthe real reason. I hope I shan\'t grow up a LIAR.\'\r\n\r\nMother said, \'Of course, dearie,\' and Anthea started swimming through\r\na sea of x\'s and y\'s and z\'s. Mother was sitting at the mahogany bureau\r\nwriting letters.\r\n\r\n\'Mother dear,\' said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, love-a-duck,\' said mother.\r\n\r\n\'About cook,\' said Anthea. \'_I_ know where she is.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you, dear?\' said mother. \'Well, I wouldn\'t take her back after the\r\nway she has behaved.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not her fault,\' said Anthea. \'May I tell you about it from the\r\nbeginning?\'\r\n\r\nMother laid down her pen, and her nice face had a resigned expression.\r\nAs you know, a resigned expression always makes you want not to tell\r\nanybody anything.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s like this,\' said Anthea, in a hurry: \'that egg, you know, that\r\ncame in the carpet; we put it in the fire and it hatched into the\r\nPhoenix, and the carpet was a wishing carpet--and--\'\r\n\r\n\'A very nice game, darling,\' said mother, taking up her pen. \'Now do\r\nbe quiet. I\'ve got a lot of letters to write. I\'m going to Bournemouth\r\nto-morrow with the Lamb--and there\'s that bazaar.\'\r\n\r\nAnthea went back to x y z, and mother\'s pen scratched busily.\r\n\r\n\'But, mother,\' said Anthea, when mother put down the pen to lick an\r\nenvelope, \'the carpet takes us wherever we like--and--\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish it would take you where you could get a few nice Eastern things\r\nfor my bazaar,\' said mother. \'I promised them, and I\'ve no time to go to\r\nLiberty\'s now.\'\r\n\r\n\'It shall,\' said Anthea, \'but, mother--\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, dear,\' said mother, a little impatiently, for she had taken up\r\nher pen again.\r\n\r\n\'The carpet took us to a place where you couldn\'t have whooping-cough,\r\nand the Lamb hasn\'t whooped since, and we took cook because she was\r\nso tiresome, and then she would stay and be queen of the savages. They\r\nthought her cap was a crown, and--\'\r\n\r\n\'Darling one,\' said mother, \'you know I love to hear the things you make\r\nup--but I am most awfully busy.\'\r\n\r\n\'But it\'s true,\' said Anthea, desperately.\r\n\r\n\'You shouldn\'t say that, my sweet,\' said mother, gently. And then Anthea\r\nknew it was hopeless.\r\n\r\n\'Are you going away for long?\' asked Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve got a cold,\' said mother, \'and daddy\'s anxious about it, and the\r\nLamb\'s cough.\'\r\n\r\n\'He hasn\'t coughed since Saturday,\' the Lamb\'s eldest sister\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\'I wish I could think so,\' mother replied. \'And daddy\'s got to go to\r\nScotland. I do hope you\'ll be good children.\'\r\n\r\n\'We will, we will,\' said Anthea, fervently. \'When\'s the bazaar?\'\r\n\r\n\'On Saturday,\' said mother, \'at the schools. Oh, don\'t talk any more,\r\nthere\'s a treasure! My head\'s going round, and I\'ve forgotten how to\r\nspell whooping-cough.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nMother and the Lamb went away, and father went away, and there was a new\r\ncook who looked so like a frightened rabbit that no one had the heart to\r\ndo anything to frighten her any more than seemed natural to her.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix begged to be excused. It said it wanted a week\'s rest, and\r\nasked that it might not be disturbed. And it hid its golden gleaming\r\nself, and nobody could find it.\r\n\r\nSo that when Wednesday afternoon brought an unexpected holiday, and\r\nevery one decided to go somewhere on the carpet, the journey had to\r\nbe undertaken without the Phoenix. They were debarred from any carpet\r\nexcursions in the evening by a sudden promise to mother, exacted in the\r\nagitation of parting, that they would not be out after six at night,\r\nexcept on Saturday, when they were to go to the bazaar, and were pledged\r\nto put on their best clothes, to wash themselves to the uttermost, and\r\nto clean their nails--not with scissors, which are scratchy and bad,\r\nbut with flat-sharpened ends of wooden matches, which do no harm to any\r\none\'s nails.\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s go and see the Lamb,\' said Jane.\r\n\r\nBut every one was agreed that if they appeared suddenly in Bournemouth\r\nit would frighten mother out of her wits, if not into a fit. So they\r\nsat on the carpet, and thought and thought and thought till they almost\r\nbegan to squint.\r\n\r\n\'Look here,\' said Cyril, \'I know. Please carpet, take us somewhere where\r\nwe can see the Lamb and mother and no one can see us.\'\r\n\r\n\'Except the Lamb,\' said Jane, quickly.\r\n\r\nAnd the next moment they found themselves recovering from the\r\nupside-down movement--and there they were sitting on the carpet, and\r\nthe carpet was laid out over another thick soft carpet of brown\r\npine-needles. There were green pine-trees overhead, and a swift clear\r\nlittle stream was running as fast as ever it could between steep\r\nbanks--and there, sitting on the pine-needle carpet, was mother, without\r\nher hat; and the sun was shining brightly, although it was November--and\r\nthere was the Lamb, as jolly as jolly and not whooping at all.\r\n\r\n\'The carpet\'s deceived us,\' said Robert, gloomily; \'mother will see us\r\ndirectly she turns her head.\'\r\n\r\nBut the faithful carpet had not deceived them.\r\n\r\nMother turned her dear head and looked straight at them, and DID NOT SEE\r\nTHEM!\r\n\r\n\'We\'re invisible,\' Cyril whispered: \'what awful larks!\'\r\n\r\nBut to the girls it was not larks at all. It was horrible to have mother\r\nlooking straight at them, and her face keeping the same, just as though\r\nthey weren\'t there.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t like it,\' said Jane. \'Mother never looked at us like that\r\nbefore. Just as if she didn\'t love us--as if we were somebody else\'s\r\nchildren, and not very nice ones either--as if she didn\'t care whether\r\nshe saw us or not.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is horrid,\' said Anthea, almost in tears.\r\n\r\nBut at this moment the Lamb saw them, and plunged towards the carpet,\r\nshrieking, \'Panty, own Panty--an\' Pussy, an\' Squiggle--an\' Bobs, oh,\r\noh!\'\r\n\r\nAnthea caught him and kissed him, so did Jane; they could not help\r\nit--he looked such a darling, with his blue three-cornered hat all on\r\none side, and his precious face all dirty--quite in the old familiar\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\'I love you, Panty; I love you--and you, and you, and you,\' cried the\r\nLamb.\r\n\r\nIt was a delicious moment. Even the boys thumped their baby brother\r\njoyously on the back.\r\n\r\nThen Anthea glanced at mother--and mother\'s face was a pale sea-green\r\ncolour, and she was staring at the Lamb as if she thought he had gone\r\nmad. And, indeed, that was exactly what she did think.\r\n\r\n\'My Lamb, my precious! Come to mother,\' she cried, and jumped up and ran\r\nto the baby.\r\n\r\nShe was so quick that the invisible children had to leap back, or she\r\nwould have felt them; and to feel what you can\'t see is the worst sort\r\nof ghost-feeling. Mother picked up the Lamb and hurried away from the\r\npinewood.\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s go home,\' said Jane, after a miserable silence. \'It feels just\r\nexactly as if mother didn\'t love us.\'\r\n\r\nBut they couldn\'t bear to go home till they had seen mother meet another\r\nlady, and knew that she was safe. You cannot leave your mother to go\r\ngreen in the face in a distant pinewood, far from all human aid, and\r\nthen go home on your wishing carpet as though nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nWhen mother seemed safe the children returned to the carpet, and said\r\n\'Home\'--and home they went.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t care about being invisible myself,\' said Cyril, \'at least, not\r\nwith my own family. It would be different if you were a prince, or a\r\nbandit, or a burglar.\'\r\n\r\nAnd now the thoughts of all four dwelt fondly on the dear greenish face\r\nof mother.\r\n\r\n\'I wish she hadn\'t gone away,\' said Jane; \'the house is simply beastly\r\nwithout her.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think we ought to do what she said,\' Anthea put in. \'I saw something\r\nin a book the other day about the wishes of the departed being sacred.\'\r\n\r\n\'That means when they\'ve departed farther off,\' said Cyril. \'India\'s\r\ncoral or Greenland\'s icy, don\'t you know; not Bournemouth. Besides, we\r\ndon\'t know what her wishes are.\'\r\n\r\n\'She SAID\'--Anthea was very much inclined to cry--\'she said, "Get Indian\r\nthings for my bazaar;" but I know she thought we couldn\'t, and it was\r\nonly play.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s get them all the same,\' said Robert. \'We\'ll go the first thing on\r\nSaturday morning.\'\r\n\r\nAnd on Saturday morning, the first thing, they went.\r\n\r\nThere was no finding the Phoenix, so they sat on the beautiful wishing\r\ncarpet, and said--\r\n\r\n\'We want Indian things for mother\'s bazaar. Will you please take us\r\nwhere people will give us heaps of Indian things?\'\r\n\r\nThe docile carpet swirled their senses away, and restored them on the\r\noutskirts of a gleaming white Indian town. They knew it was Indian at\r\nonce, by the shape of the domes and roofs; and besides, a man went by on\r\nan elephant, and two English soldiers went along the road, talking like\r\nin Mr Kipling\'s books--so after that no one could have any doubt as to\r\nwhere they were. They rolled up the carpet and Robert carried it, and\r\nthey walked bodily into the town.\r\n\r\nIt was very warm, and once more they had to take off their\r\nLondon-in-November coats, and carry them on their arms.\r\n\r\nThe streets were narrow and strange, and the clothes of the people in\r\nthe streets were stranger and the talk of the people was strangest of\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t understand a word,\' said Cyril. \'How on earth are we to ask for\r\nthings for our bazaar?\'\r\n\r\n\'And they\'re poor people, too,\' said Jane; \'I\'m sure they are. What we\r\nwant is a rajah or something.\'\r\n\r\nRobert was beginning to unroll the carpet, but the others stopped him,\r\nimploring him not to waste a wish.\r\n\r\n\'We asked the carpet to take us where we could get Indian things for\r\nbazaars,\' said Anthea, \'and it will.\'\r\n\r\nHer faith was justified.\r\n\r\nJust as she finished speaking a very brown gentleman in a turban came\r\nup to them and bowed deeply. He spoke, and they thrilled to the sound of\r\nEnglish words.\r\n\r\n\'My ranee, she think you very nice childs. She asks do you lose\r\nyourselves, and do you desire to sell carpet? She see you from her\r\npalkee. You come see her--yes?\'\r\n\r\nThey followed the stranger, who seemed to have a great many more teeth\r\nin his smile than are usual, and he led them through crooked streets\r\nto the ranee\'s palace. I am not going to describe the ranee\'s palace,\r\nbecause I really have never seen the palace of a ranee, and Mr Kipling\r\nhas. So you can read about it in his books. But I know exactly what\r\nhappened there.\r\n\r\nThe old ranee sat on a low-cushioned seat, and there were a lot of other\r\nladies with her--all in trousers and veils, and sparkling with tinsel\r\nand gold and jewels. And the brown, turbaned gentleman stood behind a\r\nsort of carved screen, and interpreted what the children said and what\r\nthe queen said. And when the queen asked to buy the carpet, the children\r\nsaid \'No.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why?\' asked the ranee.\r\n\r\nAnd Jane briefly said why, and the interpreter interpreted. The queen\r\nspoke, and then the interpreter said--\r\n\r\n\'My mistress says it is a good story, and you tell it all through\r\nwithout thought of time.\'\r\n\r\nAnd they had to. It made a long story, especially as it had all to be\r\ntold twice--once by Cyril and once by the interpreter. Cyril rather\r\nenjoyed himself. He warmed to his work, and told the tale of the Phoenix\r\nand the Carpet, and the Lone Tower, and the Queen-Cook, in language that\r\ngrew insensibly more and more Arabian Nightsy, and the ranee and her\r\nladies listened to the interpreter, and rolled about on their fat\r\ncushions with laughter.\r\n\r\nWhen the story was ended she spoke, and the interpreter explained that\r\nshe had said, \'Little one, thou art a heaven-born teller of tales,\' and\r\nshe threw him a string of turquoises from round her neck.\r\n\r\n\'OH, how lovely!\' cried Jane and Anthea.\r\n\r\nCyril bowed several times, and then cleared his throat and said--\r\n\r\n\'Thank her very, very much; but I would much rather she gave me some of\r\nthe cheap things in the bazaar. Tell her I want them to sell again, and\r\ngive the money to buy clothes for poor people who haven\'t any.\'\r\n\r\n\'Tell him he has my leave to sell my gift and clothe the naked with its\r\nprice,\' said the queen, when this was translated.\r\n\r\nBut Cyril said very firmly, \'No, thank you. The things have got to be\r\nsold to-day at our bazaar, and no one would buy a turquoise necklace at\r\nan English bazaar. They\'d think it was sham, or else they\'d want to know\r\nwhere we got it.\'\r\n\r\nSo then the queen sent out for little pretty things, and her servants\r\npiled the carpet with them.\r\n\r\n\'I must needs lend you an elephant to carry them away,\' she said,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nBut Anthea said, \'If the queen will lend us a comb and let us wash our\r\nhands and faces, she shall see a magic thing. We and the carpet and all\r\nthese brass trays and pots and carved things and stuffs and things will\r\njust vanish away like smoke.\'\r\n\r\nThe queen clapped her hands at this idea, and lent the children a\r\nsandal-wood comb inlaid with ivory lotus-flowers. And they washed their\r\nfaces and hands in silver basins. Then Cyril made a very polite farewell\r\nspeech, and quite suddenly he ended with the words--\r\n\r\n\'And I wish we were at the bazaar at our schools.\'\r\n\r\nAnd of course they were. And the queen and her ladies were left with\r\ntheir mouths open, gazing at the bare space on the inlaid marble floor\r\nwhere the carpet and the children had been.\r\n\r\n\'That is magic, if ever magic was!\' said the queen, delighted with the\r\nincident; which, indeed, has given the ladies of that court something to\r\ntalk about on wet days ever since.\r\n\r\nCyril\'s stories had taken some time, so had the meal of strange sweet\r\nfoods that they had had while the little pretty things were being\r\nbought, and the gas in the schoolroom was already lighted. Outside, the\r\nwinter dusk was stealing down among the Camden Town houses.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m glad we got washed in India,\' said Cyril. \'We should have been\r\nawfully late if we\'d had to go home and scrub.\'\r\n\r\n\'Besides,\' Robert said, \'it\'s much warmer washing in India. I shouldn\'t\r\nmind it so much if we lived there.\'\r\n\r\nThe thoughtful carpet had dumped the children down in a dusky space\r\nbehind the point where the corners of two stalls met. The floor was\r\nlittered with string and brown paper, and baskets and boxes were heaped\r\nalong the wall.\r\n\r\nThe children crept out under a stall covered with all sorts of\r\ntable-covers and mats and things, embroidered beautifully by idle\r\nladies with no real work to do. They got out at the end, displacing a\r\nsideboard-cloth adorned with a tasteful pattern of blue geraniums. The\r\ngirls got out unobserved, so did Cyril; but Robert, as he cautiously\r\nemerged, was actually walked on by Mrs Biddle, who kept the stall. Her\r\nlarge, solid foot stood firmly on the small, solid hand of Robert and\r\nwho can blame Robert if he DID yell a little?\r\n\r\nA crowd instantly collected. Yells are very unusual at bazaars, and\r\nevery one was intensely interested. It was several seconds before the\r\nthree free children could make Mrs Biddle understand that what she\r\nwas walking on was not a schoolroom floor, or even, as she presently\r\nsupposed, a dropped pin-cushion, but the living hand of a suffering\r\nchild. When she became aware that she really had hurt him, she grew very\r\nangry indeed. When people have hurt other people by accident, the one\r\nwho does the hurting is always much the angriest. I wonder why.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m very sorry, I\'m sure,\' said Mrs Biddle; but she spoke more in anger\r\nthan in sorrow. \'Come out! whatever do you mean by creeping about under\r\nthe stalls, like earwigs?\'\r\n\r\n\'We were looking at the things in the corner.\'\r\n\r\n\'Such nasty, prying ways,\' said Mrs Biddle, \'will never make you\r\nsuccessful in life. There\'s nothing there but packing and dust.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, isn\'t there!\' said Jane. \'That\'s all you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'Little girl, don\'t be rude,\' said Mrs Biddle, flushing violet.\r\n\r\n\'She doesn\'t mean to be; but there ARE some nice things there, all the\r\nsame,\' said Cyril; who suddenly felt how impossible it was to inform the\r\nlistening crowd that all the treasures piled on the carpet were mother\'s\r\ncontributions to the bazaar. No one would believe it; and if they did,\r\nand wrote to thank mother, she would think--well, goodness only knew\r\nwhat she would think. The other three children felt the same.\r\n\r\n\'I should like to see them,\' said a very nice lady, whose friends\r\nhad disappointed her, and who hoped that these might be belated\r\ncontributions to her poorly furnished stall.\r\n\r\nShe looked inquiringly at Robert, who said, \'With pleasure, don\'t\r\nmention it,\' and dived back under Mrs Biddle\'s stall.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder you encourage such behaviour,\' said Mrs Biddle. \'I always\r\nspeak my mind, as you know, Miss Peasmarsh; and, I must say, I am\r\nsurprised.\' She turned to the crowd. \'There is no entertainment here,\'\r\nshe said sternly. \'A very naughty little boy has accidentally hurt\r\nhimself, but only slightly. Will you please disperse? It will only\r\nencourage him in naughtiness if he finds himself the centre of\r\nattraction.\'\r\n\r\nThe crowd slowly dispersed. Anthea, speechless with fury, heard a nice\r\ncurate say, \'Poor little beggar!\' and loved the curate at once and for\r\never.\r\n\r\nThen Robert wriggled out from under the stall with some Benares brass\r\nand some inlaid sandalwood boxes.\r\n\r\n\'Liberty!\' cried Miss Peasmarsh. \'Then Charles has not forgotten, after\r\nall.\'\r\n\r\n\'Excuse me,\' said Mrs Biddle, with fierce politeness, \'these objects are\r\ndeposited behind MY stall. Some unknown donor who does good by stealth,\r\nand would blush if he could hear you claim the things. Of course they\r\nare for me.\'\r\n\r\n\'My stall touches yours at the corner,\' said poor Miss Peasmarsh,\r\ntimidly, \'and my cousin did promise--\'\r\n\r\nThe children sidled away from the unequal contest and mingled with\r\nthe crowd. Their feelings were too deep for words--till at last Robert\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\'That stiff-starched PIG!\'\r\n\r\n\'And after all our trouble! I\'m hoarse with gassing to that trousered\r\nlady in India.\'\r\n\r\n\'The pig-lady\'s very, very nasty,\' said Jane.\r\n\r\nIt was Anthea who said, in a hurried undertone, \'She isn\'t very nice,\r\nand Miss Peasmarsh is pretty and nice too. Who\'s got a pencil?\'\r\n\r\nIt was a long crawl, under three stalls, but Anthea did it. A large\r\npiece of pale blue paper lay among the rubbish in the corner.\r\n\r\nShe folded it to a square and wrote upon it, licking the pencil at every\r\nword to make it mark quite blackly: \'All these Indian things are for\r\npretty, nice Miss Peasmarsh\'s stall.\' She thought of adding, \'There is\r\nnothing for Mrs Biddle;\' but she saw that this might lead to suspicion,\r\nso she wrote hastily: \'From an unknown donna,\' and crept back among the\r\nboards and trestles to join the others.\r\n\r\nSo that when Mrs Biddle appealed to the bazaar committee, and the corner\r\nof the stall was lifted and shifted, so that stout clergymen and heavy\r\nladies could get to the corner without creeping under stalls, the blue\r\npaper was discovered, and all the splendid, shining Indian things were\r\ngiven over to Miss Peasmarsh, and she sold them all, and got thirty-five\r\npounds for them.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t understand about that blue paper,\' said Mrs Biddle. \'It looks\r\nto me like the work of a lunatic. And saying you were nice and pretty!\r\nIt\'s not the work of a sane person.\'\r\n\r\nAnthea and Jane begged Miss Peasmarsh to let them help her to sell the\r\nthings, because it was their brother who had announced the good news\r\nthat the things had come. Miss Peasmarsh was very willing, for now her\r\nstall, that had been SO neglected, was surrounded by people who wanted\r\nto buy, and she was glad to be helped. The children noted that Mrs\r\nBiddle had not more to do in the way of selling than she could manage\r\nquite well. I hope they were not glad--for you should forgive your\r\nenemies, even if they walk on your hands and then say it is all your\r\nnaughty fault. But I am afraid they were not so sorry as they ought to\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\nIt took some time to arrange the things on the stall. The carpet was\r\nspread over it, and the dark colours showed up the brass and silver and\r\nivory things. It was a happy and busy afternoon, and when Miss Peasmarsh\r\nand the girls had sold every single one of the little pretty things from\r\nthe Indian bazaar, far, far away, Anthea and Jane went off with the\r\nboys to fish in the fishpond, and dive into the bran-pie, and hear the\r\ncardboard band, and the phonograph, and the chorus of singing birds that\r\nwas done behind a screen with glass tubes and glasses of water.\r\n\r\nThey had a beautiful tea, suddenly presented to them by the nice curate,\r\nand Miss Peasmarsh joined them before they had had more than three cakes\r\neach. It was a merry party, and the curate was extremely pleasant to\r\nevery one, \'even to Miss Peasmarsh,\' as Jane said afterwards.\r\n\r\n\'We ought to get back to the stall,\' said Anthea, when no one could\r\npossibly eat any more, and the curate was talking in a low voice to Miss\r\nPeas marsh about \'after Easter\'.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s nothing to go back for,\' said Miss Peasmarsh gaily; \'thanks to\r\nyou dear children we\'ve sold everything.\'\r\n\r\n\'There--there\'s the carpet,\' said Cyril.\r\n\r\n\'Oh,\' said Miss Peasmarsh, radiantly, \'don\'t bother about the carpet.\r\nI\'ve sold even that. Mrs Biddle gave me ten shillings for it. She said\r\nit would do for her servant\'s bedroom.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why,\' said Jane, \'her servants don\'t HAVE carpets. We had cook from\r\nher, and she told us so.\'\r\n\r\n\'No scandal about Queen Elizabeth, if YOU please,\' said the curate,\r\ncheerfully; and Miss Peasmarsh laughed, and looked at him as though she\r\nhad never dreamed that any one COULD be so amusing. But the others were\r\nstruck dumb. How could they say, \'The carpet is ours!\' For who brings\r\ncarpets to bazaars?\r\n\r\nThe children were now thoroughly wretched. But I am glad to say that\r\ntheir wretchedness did not make them forget their manners, as it does\r\nsometimes, even with grown-up people, who ought to know ever so much\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThey said, \'Thank you very much for the jolly tea,\' and \'Thanks for\r\nbeing so jolly,\' and \'Thanks awfully for giving us such a jolly time;\'\r\nfor the curate had stood fish-ponds, and bran-pies, and phonographs, and\r\nthe chorus of singing birds, and had stood them like a man. The girls\r\nhugged Miss Peasmarsh, and as they went away they heard the curate say--\r\n\r\n\'Jolly little kids, yes, but what about--you will let it be directly\r\nafter Easter. Ah, do say you will--\'\r\n\r\nAnd Jane ran back and said, before Anthea could drag her away, \'What are\r\nyou going to do after Easter?\'\r\n\r\nMiss Peasmarsh smiled and looked very pretty indeed. And the curate\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\'I hope I am going to take a trip to the Fortunate Islands.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish we could take you on the wishing carpet,\' said Jane.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' said the curate, \'but I\'m afraid I can\'t wait for that. I\r\nmust go to the Fortunate Islands before they make me a bishop. I should\r\nhave no time afterwards.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve always thought I should marry a bishop,\' said Jane: \'his aprons\r\nwould come in so useful. Wouldn\'t YOU like to marry a bishop, Miss\r\nPeasmarsh?\'\r\n\r\nIt was then that they dragged her away.\r\n\r\nAs it was Robert\'s hand that Mrs Biddle had walked on, it was decided\r\nthat he had better not recall the incident to her mind, and so make\r\nher angry again. Anthea and Jane had helped to sell things at the rival\r\nstall, so they were not likely to be popular.\r\n\r\nA hasty council of four decided that Mrs Biddle would hate Cyril less\r\nthan she would hate the others, so the others mingled with the crowd,\r\nand it was he who said to her--\r\n\r\n\'Mrs Biddle, WE meant to have that carpet. Would you sell it to us? We\r\nwould give you--\'\r\n\r\n\'Certainly not,\' said Mrs Biddle. \'Go away, little boy.\'\r\n\r\nThere was that in her tone which showed Cyril, all too plainly, the\r\nhopelessness of persuasion. He found the others and said--\r\n\r\n\'It\'s no use; she\'s like a lioness robbed of its puppies. We must watch\r\nwhere it goes--and--Anthea, I don\'t care what you say. It\'s our own\r\ncarpet. It wouldn\'t be burglary. It would be a sort of forlorn hope\r\nrescue party--heroic and daring and dashing, and not wrong at all.\'\r\n\r\nThe children still wandered among the gay crowd--but there was no\r\npleasure there for them any more. The chorus of singing birds sounded\r\njust like glass tubes being blown through water, and the phonograph\r\nsimply made a horrid noise, so that you could hardly hear yourself\r\nspeak. And the people were buying things they couldn\'t possibly want,\r\nand it all seemed very stupid. And Mrs Biddle had bought the wishing\r\ncarpet for ten shillings. And the whole of life was sad and grey and\r\ndusty, and smelt of slight gas escapes, and hot people, and cake and\r\ncrumbs, and all the children were very tired indeed.\r\n\r\nThey found a corner within sight of the carpet, and there they waited\r\nmiserably, till it was far beyond their proper bedtime. And when it was\r\nten the people who had bought things went away, but the people who had\r\nbeen selling stayed to count up their money.\r\n\r\n\'And to jaw about it,\' said Robert. \'I\'ll never go to another bazaar as\r\nlong as ever I live. My hand is swollen as big as a pudding. I expect\r\nthe nails in her horrible boots were poisoned.\'\r\n\r\nJust then some one who seemed to have a right to interfere said--\r\n\r\n\'Everything is over now; you had better go home.\'\r\n\r\nSo they went. And then they waited on the pavement under the gas lamp,\r\nwhere ragged children had been standing all the evening to listen to\r\nthe band, and their feet slipped about in the greasy mud till Mrs Biddle\r\ncame out and was driven away in a cab with the many things she hadn\'t\r\nsold, and the few things she had bought--among others the carpet. The\r\nother stall-holders left their things at the school till Monday morning,\r\nbut Mrs Biddle was afraid some one would steal some of them, so she took\r\nthem in a cab.\r\n\r\nThe children, now too desperate to care for mud or appearances, hung\r\non behind the cab till it reached Mrs Biddle\'s house. When she and the\r\ncarpet had gone in and the door was shut Anthea said--\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t let\'s burgle--I mean do daring and dashing rescue acts--till\r\nwe\'ve given her a chance. Let\'s ring and ask to see her.\'\r\n\r\nThe others hated to do this, but at last they agreed, on condition that\r\nAnthea would not make any silly fuss about the burglary afterwards, if\r\nit really had to come to that.\r\n\r\nSo they knocked and rang, and a scared-looking parlourmaid opened the\r\nfront door. While they were asking for Mrs Biddle they saw her. She was\r\nin the dining-room, and she had already pushed back the table and spread\r\nout the carpet to see how it looked on the floor.\r\n\r\n\'I knew she didn\'t want it for her servants\' bedroom,\' Jane muttered.\r\n\r\nAnthea walked straight past the uncomfortable parlourmaid, and the\r\nothers followed her. Mrs Biddle had her back to them, and was smoothing\r\ndown the carpet with the same boot that had trampled on the hand\r\nof Robert. So that they were all in the room, and Cyril, with great\r\npresence of mind, had shut the room door before she saw them.\r\n\r\n\'Who is it, Jane?\' she asked in a sour voice; and then turning suddenly,\r\nshe saw who it was. Once more her face grew violet--a deep, dark violet.\r\n\'You wicked daring little things!\' she cried, \'how dare you come here?\r\nAt this time of night, too. Be off, or I\'ll send for the police.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be angry,\' said Anthea, soothingly, \'we only wanted to ask you\r\nto let us have the carpet. We have quite twelve shillings between us,\r\nand--\'\r\n\r\n\'How DARE you?\' cried Mrs Biddle, and her voice shook with angriness.\r\n\r\n\'You do look horrid,\' said Jane suddenly.\r\n\r\nMrs Biddle actually stamped that booted foot of hers. \'You rude,\r\nbarefaced child!\' she said.\r\n\r\nAnthea almost shook Jane; but Jane pushed forward in spite of her.\r\n\r\n\'It really IS our nursery carpet,\' she said, \'you ask ANY ONE if it\r\nisn\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s wish ourselves home,\' said Cyril in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\'No go,\' Robert whispered back, \'she\'d be there too, and raving mad as\r\nlikely as not. Horrid thing, I hate her!\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish Mrs Biddle was in an angelic good temper,\' cried Anthea,\r\nsuddenly. \'It\'s worth trying,\' she said to herself.\r\n\r\nMrs Biddle\'s face grew from purple to violet, and from violet to mauve,\r\nand from mauve to pink. Then she smiled quite a jolly smile.\r\n\r\n\'Why, so I am!\' she said, \'what a funny idea! Why shouldn\'t I be in a\r\ngood temper, my dears.\'\r\n\r\nOnce more the carpet had done its work, and not on Mrs Biddle alone. The\r\nchildren felt suddenly good and happy.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re a jolly good sort,\' said Cyril. \'I see that now. I\'m sorry we\r\nvexed you at the bazaar to-day.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not another word,\' said the changed Mrs Biddle. \'Of course you shall\r\nhave the carpet, my dears, if you\'ve taken such a fancy to it. No, no; I\r\nwon\'t have more than the ten shillings I paid.\'\r\n\r\n\'It does seem hard to ask you for it after you bought it at the bazaar,\'\r\nsaid Anthea; \'but it really IS our nursery carpet. It got to the bazaar\r\nby mistake, with some other things.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did it really, now? How vexing!\' said Mrs Biddle, kindly. \'Well, my\r\ndears, I can very well give the extra ten shillings; so you take your\r\ncarpet and we\'ll say no more about it. Have a piece of cake before you\r\ngo! I\'m so sorry I stepped on your hand, my boy. Is it all right now?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, thank you,\' said Robert. \'I say, you ARE good.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not at all,\' said Mrs Biddle, heartily. \'I\'m delighted to be able to\r\ngive any little pleasure to you dear children.\'\r\n\r\nAnd she helped them to roll up the carpet, and the boys carried it away\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n\'You ARE a dear,\' said Anthea, and she and Mrs Biddle kissed each other\r\nheartily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'WELL!\' said Cyril as they went along the street.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Robert, \'and the odd part is that you feel just as if it\r\nwas REAL--her being so jolly, I mean--and not only the carpet making her\r\nnice.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps it IS real,\' said Anthea, \'only it was covered up with\r\ncrossness and tiredness and things, and the carpet took them away.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope it\'ll keep them away,\' said Jane; \'she isn\'t ugly at all when\r\nshe laughs.\'\r\n\r\nThe carpet has done many wonders in its day; but the case of Mrs\r\nBiddle is, I think, the most wonderful. For from that day she was never\r\nanything like so disagreeable as she was before, and she sent a lovely\r\nsilver tea-pot and a kind letter to Miss Peasmarsh when the pretty lady\r\nmarried the nice curate; just after Easter it was, and they went to\r\nItaly for their honeymoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. THE TEMPLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\'I wish we could find the Phoenix,\' said Jane. \'It\'s much better company\r\nthan the carpet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Beastly ungrateful, little kids are,\' said Cyril.\r\n\r\n\'No, I\'m not; only the carpet never says anything, and it\'s so helpless.\r\nIt doesn\'t seem able to take care of itself. It gets sold, and taken\r\ninto the sea, and things like that. You wouldn\'t catch the Phoenix\r\ngetting sold.\'\r\n\r\nIt was two days after the bazaar. Every one was a little cross--some\r\ndays are like that, usually Mondays, by the way. And this was a Monday.\r\n\r\n\'I shouldn\'t wonder if your precious Phoenix had gone off for good,\'\r\nsaid Cyril; \'and I don\'t know that I blame it. Look at the weather!\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not worth looking at,\' said Robert. And indeed it wasn\'t.\r\n\r\n\'The Phoenix hasn\'t gone--I\'m sure it hasn\'t,\' said Anthea. \'I\'ll have\r\nanother look for it.\'\r\n\r\nAnthea looked under tables and chairs, and in boxes and baskets, in\r\nmother\'s work-bag and father\'s portmanteau, but still the Phoenix showed\r\nnot so much as the tip of one shining feather.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly Robert remembered how the whole of the Greek invocation\r\nsong of seven thousand lines had been condensed by him into one English\r\nhexameter, so he stood on the carpet and chanted--\r\n\r\n  \'Oh, come along, come along, you good old beautiful Phoenix,\'\r\n\r\nand almost at once there was a rustle of wings down the kitchen stairs,\r\nand the Phoenix sailed in on wide gold wings.\r\n\r\n\'Where on earth HAVE you been?\' asked Anthea. \'I\'ve looked everywhere\r\nfor you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not EVERYWHERE,\' replied the bird, \'because you did not look in the\r\nplace where I was. Confess that that hallowed spot was overlooked by\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\n\'WHAT hallowed spot?\' asked Cyril, a little impatiently, for time was\r\nhastening on, and the wishing carpet still idle.\r\n\r\n\'The spot,\' said the Phoenix, \'which I hallowed by my golden presence\r\nwas the Lutron.\'\r\n\r\n\'The WHAT?\'\r\n\r\n\'The bath--the place of washing.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure you weren\'t,\' said Jane. \'I looked there three times and moved\r\nall the towels.\'\r\n\r\n\'I was concealed,\' said the Phoenix, \'on the summit of a metal\r\ncolumn--enchanted, I should judge, for it felt warm to my golden toes,\r\nas though the glorious sun of the desert shone ever upon it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, you mean the cylinder,\' said Cyril: \'it HAS rather a comforting\r\nfeel, this weather. And now where shall we go?\'\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, the usual discussion broke out as to where they\r\nshould go and what they should do. And naturally, every one wanted to do\r\nsomething that the others did not care about.\r\n\r\n\'I am the eldest,\' Cyril remarked, \'let\'s go to the North Pole.\'\r\n\r\n\'This weather! Likely!\' Robert rejoined. \'Let\'s go to the Equator.\'\r\n\r\n\'I think the diamond mines of Golconda would be nice,\' said Anthea;\r\n\'don\'t you agree, Jane?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I don\'t,\' retorted Jane, \'I don\'t agree with you. I don\'t agree\r\nwith anybody.\'\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix raised a warning claw.\r\n\r\n\'If you cannot agree among yourselves, I fear I shall have to leave\r\nyou,\' it said.\r\n\r\n\'Well, where shall we go? You decide!\' said all.\r\n\r\n\'If I were you,\' said the bird, thoughtfully, \'I should give the carpet\r\na rest. Besides, you\'ll lose the use of your legs if you go everywhere\r\nby carpet. Can\'t you take me out and explain your ugly city to me?\'\r\n\r\n\'We will if it clears up,\' said Robert, without enthusiasm. \'Just look\r\nat the rain. And why should we give the carpet a rest?\'\r\n\r\n\'Are you greedy and grasping, and heartless and selfish?\' asked the\r\nbird, sharply.\r\n\r\n\'NO!\' said Robert, with indignation.\r\n\r\n\'Well then!\' said the Phoenix. \'And as to the rain--well, I am not fond\r\nof rain myself. If the sun knew _I_ was here--he\'s very fond of shining\r\non me because I look so bright and golden. He always says I repay a\r\nlittle attention. Haven\'t you some form of words suitable for use in wet\r\nweather?\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s "Rain, rain, go away,"\' said Anthea; \'but it never DOES go.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps you don\'t say the invocation properly,\' said the bird.\r\n\r\n     \'Rain, rain, go away,\r\n     Come again another day,\r\n     Little baby wants to play,\'\r\n\r\nsaid Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s quite wrong; and if you say it in that sort of dull way, I can\r\nquite understand the rain not taking any notice. You should open the\r\nwindow and shout as loud as you can--\r\n\r\n     \'Rain, rain, go away,\r\n     Come again another day;\r\n     Now we want the sun, and so,\r\n     Pretty rain, be kind and go!\r\n\r\n\'You should always speak politely to people when you want them to do\r\nthings, and especially when it\'s going away that you want them to do.\r\nAnd to-day you might add--\r\n\r\n     \'Shine, great sun, the lovely Phoe-\r\n     Nix is here, and wants to be\r\n     Shone on, splendid sun, by thee!\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s poetry!\' said Cyril, decidedly.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s like it,\' said the more cautious Robert.\r\n\r\n\'I was obliged to put in "lovely",\' said the Phoenix, modestly, \'to make\r\nthe line long enough.\'\r\n\r\n\'There are plenty of nasty words just that length,\' said Jane; but every\r\none else said \'Hush!\' And then they opened the window and shouted the\r\nseven lines as loud as they could, and the Phoenix said all the words\r\nwith them, except \'lovely\', and when they came to that it looked down\r\nand coughed bashfully.\r\n\r\nThe rain hesitated a moment and then went away.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s true politeness,\' said the Phoenix, and the next moment it was\r\nperched on the window-ledge, opening and shutting its radiant wings and\r\nflapping out its golden feathers in such a flood of glorious sunshine as\r\nyou sometimes have at sunset in autumn time. People said afterwards that\r\nthere had not been such sunshine in December for years and years and\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\'And now,\' said the bird, \'we will go out into the city, and you shall\r\ntake me to see one of my temples.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your temples?\'\r\n\r\n\'I gather from the carpet that I have many temples in this land.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t see how you CAN find anything out from it,\' said Jane: \'it\r\nnever speaks.\'\r\n\r\n\'All the same, you can pick up things from a carpet,\' said the bird;\r\n\'I\'ve seen YOU do it. And I have picked up several pieces of information\r\nin this way. That papyrus on which you showed me my picture--I\r\nunderstand that it bears on it the name of the street of your city in\r\nwhich my finest temple stands, with my image graved in stone and in\r\nmetal over against its portal.\'\r\n\r\n\'You mean the fire insurance office,\' said Robert. \'It\'s not really a\r\ntemple, and they don\'t--\'\r\n\r\n\'Excuse me,\' said the Phoenix, coldly, \'you are wholly misinformed. It\r\nIS a temple, and they do.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t let\'s waste the sunshine,\' said Anthea; \'we might argue as we go\r\nalong, to save time.\'\r\n\r\nSo the Phoenix consented to make itself a nest in the breast of Robert\'s\r\nNorfolk jacket, and they all went out into the splendid sunshine. The\r\nbest way to the temple of the Phoenix seemed to be to take the tram, and\r\non the top of it the children talked, while the Phoenix now and then\r\nput out a wary beak, cocked a cautious eye, and contradicted what the\r\nchildren were saying.\r\n\r\nIt was a delicious ride, and the children felt how lucky they were to\r\nhave had the money to pay for it. They went with the tram as far as it\r\nwent, and when it did not go any farther they stopped too, and got off.\r\nThe tram stops at the end of the Gray\'s Inn Road, and it was Cyril\r\nwho thought that one might well find a short cut to the Phoenix Office\r\nthrough the little streets and courts that lie tightly packed between\r\nFetter Lane and Ludgate Circus. Of course, he was quite mistaken, as\r\nRobert told him at the time, and afterwards Robert did not forbear to\r\nremind his brother how he had said so. The streets there were small\r\nand stuffy and ugly, and crowded with printers\' boys and binders\' girls\r\ncoming out from work; and these stared so hard at the pretty red coats\r\nand caps of the sisters that they wished they had gone some other way.\r\nAnd the printers and binders made very personal remarks, advising Jane\r\nto get her hair cut, and inquiring where Anthea had bought that hat.\r\nJane and Anthea scorned to reply, and Cyril and Robert found that they\r\nwere hardly a match for the rough crowd. They could think of nothing\r\nnasty enough to say. They turned a corner sharply, and then Anthea\r\npulled Jane into an archway, and then inside a door; Cyril and Robert\r\nquickly followed, and the jeering crowd passed by without seein them.\r\n\r\nAnthea drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n\'How awful!\' she said. \'I didn\'t know there were such people, except in\r\nbooks.\'\r\n\r\n\'It was a bit thick; but it\'s partly you girls\' fault, coming out in\r\nthose flashy coats.\'\r\n\r\n\'We thought we ought to, when we were going out with the Phoenix,\' said\r\nJane; and the bird said, \'Quite right, too\'--and incautiously put out\r\nhis head to give her a wink of encouragement.\r\n\r\nAnd at the same instant a dirty hand reached through the grim balustrade\r\nof the staircase beside them and clutched the Phoenix, and a hoarse\r\nvoice said--\r\n\r\n\'I say, Urb, blowed if this ain\'t our Poll parrot what we lost. Thank\r\nyou very much, lidy, for bringin\' \'im home to roost.\'\r\n\r\nThe four turned swiftly. Two large and ragged boys were crouched amid\r\nthe dark shadows of the stairs. They were much larger than Robert and\r\nCyril, and one of them had snatched the Phoenix away and was holding it\r\nhigh above their heads.\r\n\r\n\'Give me that bird,\' said Cyril, sternly: \'it\'s ours.\'\r\n\r\n\'Good arternoon, and thankin\' you,\' the boy went on, with maddening\r\nmockery. \'Sorry I can\'t give yer tuppence for yer trouble--but I\'ve\r\n\'ad to spend my fortune advertising for my vallyable bird in all the\r\nnewspapers. You can call for the reward next year.\'\r\n\r\n\'Look out, Ike,\' said his friend, a little anxiously; \'it \'ave a beak on\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s other parties as\'ll have the Beak on to \'em presently,\' said Ike,\r\ndarkly, \'if they come a-trying to lay claims on my Poll parrot. You just\r\nshut up, Urb. Now then, you four little gells, get out er this.\'\r\n\r\n\'Little girls!\' cried Robert. \'I\'ll little girl you!\'\r\n\r\nHe sprang up three stairs and hit out.\r\n\r\nThere was a squawk--the most bird-like noise any one had ever heard\r\nfrom the Phoenix--and a fluttering, and a laugh in the darkness, and Ike\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\'There now, you\'ve been and gone and strook my Poll parrot right in the\r\nfevvers--strook \'im something crool, you \'ave.\'\r\n\r\nRobert stamped with fury. Cyril felt himself growing pale with rage,\r\nand with the effort of screwing up his brain to make it clever enough to\r\nthink of some way of being even with those boys. Anthea and Jane were as\r\nangry as the boys, but it made them want to cry. Yet it was Anthea who\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\'Do, PLEASE, let us have the bird.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dew, PLEASE, get along and leave us an\' our bird alone.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you don\'t,\' said Anthea, \'I shall fetch the police.\'\r\n\r\n\'You better!\' said he who was named Urb. \'Say, Ike, you twist the\r\nbloomin\' pigeon\'s neck; he ain\'t worth tuppence.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, no,\' cried Jane, \'don\'t hurt it. Oh, don\'t; it is such a pet.\'\r\n\r\n\'I won\'t hurt it,\' said Ike; \'I\'m \'shamed of you, Urb, for to think of\r\nsuch a thing. Arf a shiner, miss, and the bird is yours for life.\'\r\n\r\n\'Half a WHAT?\' asked Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'Arf a shiner, quid, thick \'un--half a sov, then.\'\r\n\r\n\'I haven\'t got it--and, besides, it\'s OUR bird,\' said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, don\'t talk to him,\' said Cyril and then Jane said suddenly--\r\n\r\n\'Phoenix--dear Phoenix, we can\'t do anything. YOU must manage it.\'\r\n\r\n\'With pleasure,\' said the Phoenix--and Ike nearly dropped it in his\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n\'I say, it do talk, suthin\' like,\' said he.\r\n\r\n\'Youths,\' said the Phoenix, \'sons of misfortune, hear my words.\'\r\n\r\n\'My eyes!\' said Ike.\r\n\r\n\'Look out, Ike,\' said Urb, \'you\'ll throttle the joker--and I see at\r\nwunst \'e was wuth \'is weight in flimsies.\'00\r\n\r\n\'Hearken, O Eikonoclastes, despiser of sacred images--and thou, Urbanus,\r\ndweller in the sordid city. Forbear this adventure lest a worse thing\r\nbefall.\'\r\n\r\n\'Luv\' us!\' said Ike, \'ain\'t it been taught its schoolin\' just!\'\r\n\r\n\'Restore me to my young acolytes and escape unscathed. Retain me--and--\'\r\n\r\n\'They must ha\' got all this up, case the Polly got pinched,\' said Ike.\r\n\'Lor\' lumme, the artfulness of them young uns!\'\r\n\r\n\'I say, slosh \'em in the geseech and get clear off with the swag\'s wot I\r\nsay,\' urged Herbert.\r\n\r\n\'Right O,\' said Isaac.\r\n\r\n\'Forbear,\' repeated the Phoenix, sternly. \'Who pinched the click off of\r\nthe old bloke in Aldermanbury?\' it added, in a changed tone.\r\n\r\n\'Who sneaked the nose-rag out of the young gell\'s \'and in Bell Court?\r\nWho--\'\r\n\r\n\'Stow it,\' said Ike. \'You! ugh! yah!--leave go of me. Bash him off, Urb;\r\n\'e\'ll have my bloomin\' eyes outer my ed.\'\r\n\r\nThere were howls, a scuffle, a flutter; Ike and Urb fled up the stairs,\r\nand the Phoenix swept out through the doorway. The children followed and\r\nthe Phoenix settled on Robert, \'like a butterfly on a rose,\' as Anthea\r\nsaid afterwards, and wriggled into the breast of his Norfolk jacket,\r\n\'like an eel into mud,\' as Cyril later said.\r\n\r\n\'Why ever didn\'t you burn him? You could have, couldn\'t you?\' asked\r\nRobert, when the hurried flight through the narrow courts had ended in\r\nthe safe wideness of Farringdon Street.\r\n\r\n\'I could have, of course,\' said the bird, \'but I didn\'t think it would\r\nbe dignified to allow myself to get warm about a little thing like that.\r\nThe Fates, after all, have not been illiberal to me. I have a good many\r\nfriends among the London sparrows, and I have a beak and claws.\'\r\n\r\nThese happenings had somewhat shaken the adventurous temper of the\r\nchildren, and the Phoenix had to exert its golden self to hearten them\r\nup.\r\n\r\nPresently the children came to a great house in Lombard Street, and\r\nthere, on each side of the door, was the image of the Phoenix carved in\r\nstone, and set forth on shining brass were the words--\r\n\r\n     PHOENIX FIRE OFFICE\r\n\r\n\r\n\'One moment,\' said the bird. \'Fire? For altars, I suppose?\'\r\n\r\n\'_I_ don\'t know,\' said Robert; he was beginning to feel shy, and that\r\nalways made him rather cross.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, yes, you do,\' Cyril contradicted. \'When people\'s houses are burnt\r\ndown the Phoenix gives them new houses. Father told me; I asked him.\'\r\n\r\n\'The house, then, like the Phoenix, rises from its ashes? Well have my\r\npriests dealt with the sons of men!\'\r\n\r\n\'The sons of men pay, you know,\' said Anthea; \'but it\'s only a little\r\nevery year.\'\r\n\r\n\'That is to maintain my priests,\' said the bird, \'who, in the hour of\r\naffliction, heal sorrows and rebuild houses. Lead on; inquire for the\r\nHigh Priest. I will not break upon them too suddenly in all my glory.\r\nNoble and honour-deserving are they who make as nought the evil deeds of\r\nthe lame-footed and unpleasing Hephaestus.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know what you\'re talking about, and I wish you wouldn\'t muddle\r\nus with new names. Fire just happens. Nobody does it--not as a deed,\r\nyou know,\' Cyril explained. \'If they did the Phoenix wouldn\'t help them,\r\nbecause its a crime to set fire to things. Arsenic, or something they\r\ncall it, because it\'s as bad as poisoning people. The Phoenix wouldn\'t\r\nhelp THEM--father told me it wouldn\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'My priests do well,\' said the Phoenix. \'Lead on.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know what to say,\' said Cyril; and the Others said the same.\r\n\r\n\'Ask for the High Priest,\' said the Phoenix. \'Say that you have a\r\nsecret to unfold that concerns my worship, and he will lead you to the\r\ninnermost sanctuary.\'\r\n\r\nSo the children went in, all four of them, though they didn\'t like it,\r\nand stood in a large and beautiful hall adorned with Doulton tiles,\r\nlike a large and beautiful bath with no water in it, and stately pillars\r\nsupporting the roof. An unpleasing representation of the Phoenix in\r\nbrown pottery disfigured one wall. There were counters and desks of\r\nmahogany and brass, and clerks bent over the desks and walked behind the\r\ncounters. There was a great clock over an inner doorway.\r\n\r\n\'Inquire for the High Priest,\' whispered the Phoenix.\r\n\r\nAn attentive clerk in decent black, who controlled his mouth but not his\r\neyebrows, now came towards them. He leaned forward on the counter, and\r\nthe children thought he was going to say, \'What can I have the pleasure\r\nof showing you?\' like in a draper\'s; instead of which the young man\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\'And what do YOU want?\'\r\n\r\n\'We want to see the High Priest.\'\r\n\r\n\'Get along with you,\' said the young man.\r\n\r\nAn elder man, also decent in black coat, advanced.\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps it\'s Mr Blank\' (not for worlds would I give the name). \'He\'s a\r\nMasonic High Priest, you know.\'\r\n\r\nA porter was sent away to look for Mr Asterisk (I cannot give his name),\r\nand the children were left there to look on and be looked on by all\r\nthe gentlemen at the mahogany desks. Anthea and Jane thought that they\r\nlooked kind. The boys thought they stared, and that it was like their\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nThe porter returned with the news that Mr Dot Dash Dot (I dare not\r\nreveal his name) was out, but that Mr--\r\n\r\nHere a really delightful gentleman appeared. He had a beard and a kind\r\nand merry eye, and each one of the four knew at once that this was a man\r\nwho had kiddies of his own and could understand what you were talking\r\nabout. Yet it was a difficult thing to explain.\r\n\r\n\'What is it?\' he asked. \'Mr\'--he named the name which I will never\r\nreveal--\'is out. Can I do anything?\'\r\n\r\n\'Inner sanctuary,\' murmured the Phoenix.\r\n\r\n\'I beg your pardon,\' said the nice gentleman, who thought it was Robert\r\nwho had spoken.\r\n\r\n\'We have something to tell you,\' said Cyril, \'but\'--he glanced at the\r\nporter, who was lingering much nearer than he need have done--\'this is a\r\nvery public place.\'\r\n\r\nThe nice gentleman laughed.\r\n\r\n\'Come upstairs then,\' he said, and led the way up a wide and beautiful\r\nstaircase. Anthea says the stairs were of white marble, but I am not\r\nsure. On the corner-post of the stairs, at the top, was a beautiful\r\nimage of the Phoenix in dark metal, and on the wall at each side was a\r\nflat sort of image of it.\r\n\r\nThe nice gentleman led them into a room where the chairs, and even the\r\ntables, were covered with reddish leather. He looked at the children\r\ninquiringly.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be frightened,\' he said; \'tell me exactly what you want.\'\r\n\r\n\'May I shut the door?\' asked Cyril.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman looked surprised, but he shut the door.\r\n\r\n\'Now,\' said Cyril, firmly, \'I know you\'ll be awfully surprised, and\r\nyou\'ll think it\'s not true and we are lunatics; but we aren\'t, and it\r\nis. Robert\'s got something inside his Norfolk--that\'s Robert, he\'s my\r\nyoung brother. Now don\'t be upset and have a fit or anything sir. Of\r\ncourse, I know when you called your shop the "Phoenix" you never thought\r\nthere was one; but there is--and Robert\'s got it buttoned up against his\r\nchest!\'\r\n\r\n\'If it\'s an old curio in the form of a Phoenix, I dare say the Board--\'\r\nsaid the nice gentleman, as Robert began to fumble with his buttons.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s old enough,\' said Anthea, \'going by what it says, but--\'\r\n\r\n\'My goodness gracious!\' said the gentleman, as the Phoenix, with one\r\nlast wriggle that melted into a flutter, got out of its nest in the\r\nbreast of Robert and stood up on the leather-covered table.\r\n\r\n\'What an extraordinarily fine bird!\' he went on. \'I don\'t think I ever\r\nsaw one just like it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should think not,\' said the Phoenix, with pardonable pride. And the\r\ngentleman jumped.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, it\'s been taught to speak! Some sort of parrot, perhaps?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am,\' said the bird, simply, \'the Head of your House, and I have come\r\nto my temple to receive your homage. I am no parrot\'--its beak curved\r\nscornfully--\'I am the one and only Phoenix, and I demand the homage of\r\nmy High Priest.\'\r\n\r\n\'In the absence of our manager,\' the gentleman began, exactly as though\r\nhe were addressing a valued customer--\'in the absence of our manager, I\r\nmight perhaps be able--What am I saying?\' He turned pale, and passed\r\nhis hand across his brow. \'My dears,\' he said, \'the weather is unusually\r\nwarm for the time of year, and I don\'t feel quite myself. Do you know,\r\nfor a moment I really thought that that remarkable bird of yours had\r\nspoken and said it was the Phoenix, and, what\'s more, that I\'d believed\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n\'So it did, sir,\' said Cyril, \'and so did you.\'\r\n\r\n\'It really--Allow me.\'\r\n\r\nA bell was rung. The porter appeared.\r\n\r\n\'Mackenzie,\' said the gentleman, \'you see that golden bird?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir.\'\r\n\r\nThe other breathed a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\'It IS real, then?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, sir, of course, sir. You take it in your hand, sir,\' said the\r\nporter, sympathetically, and reached out his hand to the Phoenix, who\r\nshrank back on toes curved with agitated indignation.\r\n\r\n\'Forbear!\' it cried; \'how dare you seek to lay hands on me?\'\r\n\r\nThe porter saluted.\r\n\r\n\'Beg pardon, sir,\' he said, \'I thought you was a bird.\'\r\n\r\n\'I AM a bird--THE bird--the Phoenix.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course you are, sir,\' said the porter. \'I see that the first minute,\r\ndirectly I got my breath, sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'That will do,\' said the gentleman. \'Ask Mr Wilson and Mr Sterry to step\r\nup here for a moment, please.\'\r\n\r\nMr Sterry and Mr Wilson were in their turn overcome by\r\namazement--quickly followed by conviction. To the surprise of the\r\nchildren every one in the office took the Phoenix at its word, and after\r\nthe first shock of surprise it seemed to be perfectly natural to every\r\none that the Phoenix should be alive, and that, passing through London,\r\nit should call at its temple.\r\n\r\n\'We ought to have some sort of ceremony,\' said the nicest\r\ngentleman, anxiously. \'There isn\'t time to summon the directors and\r\nshareholders--we might do that tomorrow, perhaps. Yes, the board-room\r\nwould be best. I shouldn\'t like it to feel we hadn\'t done everything in\r\nour power to show our appreciation of its condescension in looking in on\r\nus in this friendly way.\'\r\n\r\nThe children could hardly believe their ears, for they had never thought\r\nthat any one but themselves would believe in the Phoenix. And yet every\r\none did; all the men in the office were brought in by twos and threes,\r\nand the moment the Phoenix opened its beak it convinced the cleverest\r\nof them, as well as those who were not so clever. Cyril wondered how the\r\nstory would look in the papers next day. He seemed to see the posters in\r\nthe streets:\r\n\r\n    PHOENIX FIRE OFFICE\r\n    THE PHOENIX AT ITS TEMPLE\r\n    MEETING TO WELCOME IT\r\n    DELIGHT OF THE MANAGER AND EVERYBODY.\r\n\r\n\'Excuse our leaving you a moment,\' said the nice gentleman, and he went\r\naway with the others; and through the half-closed door the children\r\ncould hear the sound of many boots on stairs, the hum of excited voices\r\nexplaining, suggesting, arguing, the thumpy drag of heavy furniture\r\nbeing moved about.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix strutted up and down the leather-covered table, looking over\r\nits shoulder at its pretty back.\r\n\r\n\'You see what a convincing manner I have,\' it said proudly.\r\n\r\nAnd now a new gentleman came in and said, bowing low--\r\n\r\n\'Everything is prepared--we have done our best at so short a notice; the\r\nmeeting--the ceremony--will be in the board-room. Will the Honourable\r\nPhoenix walk--it is only a few steps--or would it like to be--would it\r\nlike some sort of conveyance?\'\r\n\r\n\'My Robert will bear me to the board-room, if that be the unlovely name\r\nof my temple\'s inmost court,\' replied the bird.\r\n\r\nSo they all followed the gentleman. There was a big table in the\r\nboard-room, but it had been pushed right up under the long windows at\r\none side, and chairs were arranged in rows across the room--like those\r\nyou have at schools when there is a magic lantern on \'Our Eastern\r\nEmpire\', or on \'The Way We Do in the Navy\'. The doors were of carved\r\nwood, very beautiful, with a carved Phoenix above. Anthea noticed that\r\nthe chairs in the front rows were of the kind that her mother so loved\r\nto ask the price of in old furniture shops, and never could buy, because\r\nthe price was always nearly twenty pounds each. On the mantelpiece were\r\nsome heavy bronze candlesticks and a clock, and on the top of the clock\r\nwas another image of the Phoenix.\r\n\r\n\'Remove that effigy,\' said the Phoenix to the gentlemen who were there,\r\nand it was hastily taken down. Then the Phoenix fluttered to the middle\r\nof the mantelpiece and stood there, looking more golden than ever. Then\r\nevery one in the house and the office came in--from the cashier to the\r\nwomen who cooked the clerks\' dinners in the beautiful kitchen at the top\r\nof the house. And every one bowed to the Phoenix and then sat down in a\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\'Gentlemen,\' said the nicest gentleman, \'we have met here today--\'\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix was turning its golden beak from side to side.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t notice any incense,\' it said, with an injured sniff. A hurried\r\nconsultation ended in plates being fetched from the kitchen. Brown\r\nsugar, sealing-wax, and tobacco were placed on these, and something from\r\na square bottle was poured over it all. Then a match was applied. It was\r\nthe only incense that was handy in the Phoenix office, and it certainly\r\nburned very briskly and smoked a great deal.\r\n\r\n\'We have met here today,\' said the gentleman again, \'on an occasion\r\nunparalleled in the annals of this office. Our respected Phoenix--\'\r\n\r\n\'Head of the House,\' said the Phoenix, in a hollow voice.\r\n\r\n\'I was coming to that. Our respected Phoenix, the Head of this ancient\r\nHouse, has at length done us the honour to come among us. I think I may\r\nsay, gentlemen, that we are not insensible to this honour, and that we\r\nwelcome with no uncertain voice one whom we have so long desired to see\r\nin our midst.\'\r\n\r\nSeveral of the younger clerks thought of saying \'Hear, hear,\' but they\r\nfeared it might seem disrespectful to the bird.\r\n\r\n\'I will not take up your time,\' the speaker went on, \'by recapitulating\r\nthe advantages to be derived from a proper use of our system of fire\r\ninsurance. I know, and you know, gentlemen, that our aim has ever been\r\nto be worthy of that eminent bird whose name we bear, and who now adorns\r\nour mantelpiece with his presence. Three cheers, gentlemen, for the\r\nwinged Head of the House!\'\r\n\r\nThe cheers rose, deafening. When they had died away the Phoenix was\r\nasked to say a few words.\r\n\r\nIt expressed in graceful phrases the pleasure it felt in finding itself\r\nat last in its own temple.\r\n\r\n\'And,\' it went on, \'You must not think me wanting in appreciation of\r\nyour very hearty and cordial reception when I ask that an ode may be\r\nrecited or a choric song sung. It is what I have always been accustomed\r\nto.\'\r\n\r\nThe four children, dumb witnesses of this wonderful scene, glanced a\r\nlittle nervously across the foam of white faces above the sea of black\r\ncoats. It seemed to them that the Phoenix was really asking a little too\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n\'Time presses,\' said the Phoenix, \'and the original ode of invocation is\r\nlong, as well as being Greek; and, besides, it\'s no use invoking me when\r\nhere I am; but is there not a song in your own tongue for a great day\r\nsuch as this?\'\r\n\r\nAbsently the manager began to sing, and one by one the rest joined--\r\n\r\n     \'Absolute security!\r\n     No liability!\r\n     All kinds of property\r\n     insured against fire.\r\n     Terms most favourable,\r\n     Expenses reasonable,\r\n     Moderate rates for annual\r\n     Insurance.\'\r\n\r\n\'That one is NOT my favourite,\' interrupted the Phoenix, \'and I think\r\nyou\'ve forgotten part of it.\'\r\n\r\nThe manager hastily began another--\r\n\r\n     \'O Golden Phoenix, fairest bird,\r\n     The whole great world has often heard\r\n     Of all the splendid things we do,\r\n     Great Phoenix, just to honour you.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s better,\' said the bird. And every one sang--\r\n\r\n     \'Class one, for private dwelling-house,\r\n     For household goods and shops allows;\r\n     Provided these are built of brick\r\n     Or stone, and tiled and slated thick.\'\r\n\r\n\'Try another verse,\' said the Phoenix, \'further on.\'\r\n\r\nAnd again arose the voices of all the clerks and employees and managers\r\nand secretaries and cooks--\r\n\r\n    \'In Scotland our insurance yields\r\n     The price of burnt-up stacks in fields.\'\r\n\r\n\'Skip that verse,\' said the Phoenix.\r\n\r\n     \'Thatched dwellings and their whole contents\r\n     We deal with--also with their rents;\r\n     Oh, glorious Phoenix, look and see\r\n     That these are dealt with in class three.\r\n\r\n     \'The glories of your temple throng\r\n     Too thick to go in any song;\r\n     And we attend, O good and wise,\r\n     To "days of grace" and merchandise.\r\n\r\n     \'When people\'s homes are burned away\r\n     They never have a cent to pay\r\n     If they have done as all should do,\r\n     O Phoenix, and have honoured you.\r\n\r\n     \'So let us raise our voice and sing\r\n     The praises of the Phoenix King.\r\n     In classes one and two and three,\r\n     Oh, trust to him, for kind is he!\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure YOU\'RE very kind,\' said the Phoenix; \'and now we must be\r\ngoing. An thank you very much for a very pleasant time. May you all\r\nprosper as you deserve to do, for I am sure a nicer, pleasanter-spoken\r\nlot of temple attendants I have never met, and never wish to meet. I\r\nwish you all good-day!\'\r\n\r\nIt fluttered to the wrist of Robert and drew the four children from the\r\nroom. The whole of the office staff followed down the wide stairs and\r\nfiled into their accustomed places, and the two most important officials\r\nstood on the steps bowing till Robert had buttoned the golden bird in\r\nhis Norfolk bosom, and it and he and the three other children were lost\r\nin the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe two most important gentlemen looked at each other earnestly and\r\nstrangely for a moment, and then retreated to those sacred inner rooms,\r\nwhere they toil without ceasing for the good of the House.\r\n\r\nAnd the moment they were all in their places--managers, secretaries,\r\nclerks, and porters--they all started, and each looked cautiously round\r\nto see if any one was looking at him. For each thought that he had\r\nfallen asleep for a few minutes, and had dreamed a very odd dream about\r\nthe Phoenix and the board-room. And, of course, no one mentioned it\r\nto any one else, because going to sleep at your office is a thing you\r\nsimply MUST NOT do.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary confusion of the board-room, with the remains of the\r\nincense in the plates, would have shown them at once that the visit of\r\nthe Phoenix had been no dream, but a radiant reality, but no one went\r\ninto the board-room again that day; and next day, before the office\r\nwas opened, it was all cleaned and put nice and tidy by a lady whose\r\nbusiness asking questions was not part of. That is why Cyril read\r\nthe papers in vain on the next day and the day after that; because no\r\nsensible person thinks his dreams worth putting in the paper, and no one\r\nwill ever own that he has been asleep in the daytime.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix was very pleased, but it decided to write an ode for itself.\r\nIt thought the ones it had heard at its temple had been too hastily\r\ncomposed. Its own ode began--\r\n\r\n     \'For beauty and for modest worth\r\n     The Phoenix has not its equal on earth.\'\r\n\r\nAnd when the children went to bed that night it was still trying to cut\r\ndown the last line to the proper length without taking out any of what\r\nit wanted to say.\r\n\r\nThat is what makes poetry so difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. DOING GOOD\r\n\r\n\r\n\'We shan\'t be able to go anywhere on the carpet for a whole week,\r\nthough,\' said Robert.\r\n\r\n\'And I\'m glad of it,\' said Jane, unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n\'Glad?\' said Cyril; \'GLAD?\'\r\n\r\nIt was breakfast-time, and mother\'s letter, telling them how they were\r\nall going for Christmas to their aunt\'s at Lyndhurst, and how father and\r\nmother would meet them there, having been read by every one, lay on the\r\ntable, drinking hot bacon-fat with one corner and eating marmalade with\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, glad,\' said Jane. \'I don\'t want any more things to happen\r\njust now. I feel like you do when you\'ve been to three parties in a\r\nweek--like we did at granny\'s once--and extras in between, toys and\r\nchocs and things like that. I want everything to be just real, and no\r\nfancy things happening at all.\' \'I don\'t like being obliged to keep\r\nthings from mother,\' said Anthea. \'I don\'t know why, but it makes me\r\nfeel selfish and mean.\'\r\n\r\n\'If we could only get the mater to believe it, we might take her to the\r\njolliest places,\' said Cyril, thoughtfully. \'As it is, we\'ve just got to\r\nbe selfish and mean--if it is that--but I don\'t feel it is.\'\r\n\r\n\'I KNOW it isn\'t, but I FEEL it is,\' said Anthea, \'and that\'s just as\r\nbad.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s worse,\' said Robert; \'if you knew it and didn\'t feel it, it\r\nwouldn\'t matter so much.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s being a hardened criminal, father says,\' put in Cyril, and he\r\npicked up mother\'s letter and wiped its corners with his handkerchief,\r\nto whose colour a trifle of bacon-fat and marmalade made but little\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\n\'We\'re going to-morrow, anyhow,\' said Robert. \'Don\'t,\' he added, with\r\na good-boy expression on his face--\'don\'t let\'s be ungrateful for our\r\nblessings; don\'t let\'s waste the day in saying how horrid it is to keep\r\nsecrets from mother, when we all know Anthea tried all she knew to give\r\nher the secret, and she wouldn\'t take it. Let\'s get on the carpet and\r\nhave a jolly good wish. You\'ll have time enough to repent of things all\r\nnext week.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Cyril, \'let\'s. It\'s not really wrong.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, look here,\' said Anthea. \'You know there\'s something about\r\nChristmas that makes you want to be good--however little you wish it at\r\nother times. Couldn\'t we wish the carpet to take us somewhere where we\r\nshould have the chance to do some good and kind action? It would be an\r\nadventure just the same,\' she pleaded.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t mind,\' said Cyril. \'We shan\'t know where we\'re going, and\r\nthat\'ll be exciting. No one knows what\'ll happen. We\'d best put on our\r\nouters in case--\'\r\n\r\n\'We might rescue a traveller buried in the snow, like St Bernard dogs,\r\nwith barrels round our necks,\' said Jane, beginning to be interested.\r\n\r\n\'Or we might arrive just in time to witness a will being signed--more\r\ntea, please,\' said Robert, \'and we should see the old man hide it away\r\nin the secret cupboard; and then, after long years, when the rightful\r\nheir was in despair, we should lead him to the hidden panel and--\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' interrupted Anthea; \'or we might be taken to some freezing garret\r\nin a German town, where a poor little pale, sick child--\'\r\n\r\n\'We haven\'t any German money,\' interrupted Cyril, \'so THAT\'S no go. What\r\nI should like would be getting into the middle of a war and getting hold\r\nof secret intelligence and taking it to the general, and he would make\r\nme a lieutenant or a scout, or a hussar.\'\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast was cleared away, Anthea swept the carpet, and the\r\nchildren sat down on it, together with the Phoenix, who had been\r\nespecially invited, as a Christmas treat, to come with them and witness\r\nthe good and kind action they were about to do.\r\n\r\nFour children and one bird were ready, and the wish was wished.\r\n\r\nEvery one closed its eyes, so as to feel the topsy-turvy swirl of the\r\ncarpet\'s movement as little as possible.\r\n\r\nWhen the eyes were opened again the children found themselves on the\r\ncarpet, and the carpet was in its proper place on the floor of their own\r\nnursery at Camden Town.\r\n\r\n\'I say,\' said Cyril, \'here\'s a go!\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you think it\'s worn out? The wishing part of it, I mean?\' Robert\r\nanxiously asked the Phoenix.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not that,\' said the Phoenix; \'but--well--what did you wish--?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! I see what it means,\' said Robert, with deep disgust; \'it\'s like\r\nthe end of a fairy story in a Sunday magazine. How perfectly beastly!\'\r\n\r\n\'You mean it means we can do kind and good actions where we are? I see.\r\nI suppose it wants us to carry coals for the cook or make clothes\r\nfor the bare heathens. Well, I simply won\'t. And the last day and\r\neverything. Look here!\' Cyril spoke loudly and firmly. \'We want to go\r\nsomewhere really interesting, where we have a chance of doing something\r\ngood and kind; we don\'t want to do it here, but somewhere else. See?\r\nNow, then.\'\r\n\r\nThe obedient carpet started instantly, and the four children and one\r\nbird fell in a heap together, and as they fell were plunged in perfect\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n\'Are you all there?\' said Anthea, breathlessly, through the black dark.\r\nEvery one owned that it was there.\r\n\r\n\'Where are we? Oh! how shivery and wet it is! Ugh!--oh!--I\'ve put my\r\nhand in a puddle!\'\r\n\r\n\'Has any one got any matches?\' said Anthea, hopelessly. She felt sure\r\nthat no one would have any.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Robert, with a radiant smile of triumph that was quite\r\nwasted in the darkness, where, of course, no one could see anything,\r\ndrew out of his pocket a box of matches, struck a match and lighted a\r\ncandle--two candles. And every one, with its mouth open, blinked at the\r\nsudden light.\r\n\r\n\'Well done Bobs,\' said his sisters, and even Cyril\'s natural brotherly\r\nfeelings could not check his admiration of Robert\'s foresight.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve always carried them about ever since the lone tower day,\' said\r\nRobert, with modest pride. \'I knew we should want them some day. I kept\r\nthe secret well, didn\'t I?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, yes,\' said Cyril, with fine scorn. \'I found them the Sunday after,\r\nwhen I was feeling in your Norfolks for the knife you borrowed off me.\r\nBut I thought you\'d only sneaked them for Chinese lanterns, or reading\r\nin bed by.\'\r\n\r\n\'Bobs,\' said Anthea, suddenly, \'do you know where we are? This is\r\nthe underground passage, and look there--there\'s the money and the\r\nmoney-bags, and everything.\'\r\n\r\nBy this time the ten eyes had got used to the light of the candles, and\r\nno one could help seeing that Anthea spoke the truth.\r\n\r\n\'It seems an odd place to do good and kind acts in, though,\' said Jane.\r\n\'There\'s no one to do them to.\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you be too sure,\' said Cyril; \'just round the next turning we\r\nmight find a prisoner who has languished here for years and years, and\r\nwe could take him out on our carpet and restore him to his sorrowing\r\nfriends.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course we could,\' said Robert, standing up and holding the candle\r\nabove his head to see further off; \'or we might find the bones of a\r\npoor prisoner and take them to his friends to be buried properly--that\'s\r\nalways a kind action in books, though I never could see what bones\r\nmatter.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish you wouldn\'t,\' said Jane.\r\n\r\n\'I know exactly where we shall find the bones, too,\' Robert went on.\r\n\'You see that dark arch just along the passage? Well, just inside\r\nthere--\'\r\n\r\n\'If you don\'t stop going on like that,\' said Jane, firmly, \'I shall\r\nscream, and then I\'ll faint--so now then!\'\r\n\r\n\'And _I_ will, too,\' said Anthea.\r\n\r\nRobert was not pleased at being checked in his flight of fancy.\r\n\r\n\'You girls will never be great writers,\' he said bitterly. \'They just\r\nlove to think of things in dungeons, and chains, and knobbly bare human\r\nbones, and--\'\r\n\r\nJane had opened her mouth to scream, but before she could decide how you\r\nbegan when you wanted to faint, the golden voice of the Phoenix spoke\r\nthrough the gloom.\r\n\r\n\'Peace!\' it said; \'there are no bones here except the small but useful\r\nsets that you have inside you. And you did not invite me to come out\r\nwith you to hear you talk about bones, but to see you do some good and\r\nkind action.\'\r\n\r\n\'We can\'t do it here,\' said Robert, sulkily.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' rejoined the bird. \'The only thing we can do here, it seems, is to\r\ntry to frighten our little sisters.\'\r\n\r\n\'He didn\'t, really, and I\'m not so VERY little,\' said Jane, rather\r\nungratefully.\r\n\r\nRobert was silent. It was Cyril who suggested that perhaps they had\r\nbetter take the money and go.\r\n\r\n\'That wouldn\'t be a kind act, except to ourselves; and it wouldn\'t be\r\ngood, whatever way you look at it,\' said Anthea, \'to take money that\'s\r\nnot ours.\'\r\n\r\n\'We might take it and spend it all on benefits to the poor and aged,\'\r\nsaid Cyril.\r\n\r\n\'That wouldn\'t make it right to steal,\' said Anthea, stoutly.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know,\' said Cyril. They were all standing up now. \'Stealing is\r\ntaking things that belong to some one else, and there\'s no one else.\'\r\n\r\n\'It can\'t be stealing if--\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s right,\' said Robert, with ironical approval; \'stand here all day\r\narguing while the candles burn out. You\'ll like it awfully when it\'s all\r\ndark again--and bony.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s get out, then,\' said Anthea. \'We can argue as we go.\' So they\r\nrolled up the carpet and went. But when they had crept along to the\r\nplace where the passage led into the topless tower they found the way\r\nblocked by a great stone, which they could not move.\r\n\r\n\'There!\' said Robert. \'I hope you\'re satisfied!\'\r\n\r\n\'Everything has two ends,\' said the Phoenix, softly; \'even a quarrel or\r\na secret passage.\'\r\n\r\nSo they turned round and went back, and Robert was made to go first with\r\none of the candles, because he was the one who had begun to talk about\r\nbones. And Cyril carried the carpet.\r\n\r\n\'I wish you hadn\'t put bones into our heads,\' said Jane, as they went\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t; you always had them. More bones than brains,\' said Robert.\r\n\r\nThe passage was long, and there were arches and steps and turnings and\r\ndark alcoves that the girls did not much like passing. The passage ended\r\nin a flight of steps. Robert went up them.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he staggered heavily back on to the following feet of Jane, and\r\neverybody screamed, \'Oh! what is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve only bashed my head in,\' said Robert, when he had groaned for some\r\ntime; \'that\'s all. Don\'t mention it; I like it. The stairs just go right\r\nslap into the ceiling, and it\'s a stone ceiling. You can\'t do good and\r\nkind actions underneath a paving-stone.\'\r\n\r\n\'Stairs aren\'t made to lead just to paving-stones as a general rule,\'\r\nsaid the Phoenix. \'Put your shoulder to the wheel.\'\r\n\r\n\'There isn\'t any wheel,\' said the injured Robert, still rubbing his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nBut Cyril had pushed past him to the top stair, and was already shoving\r\nhis hardest against the stone above. Of course, it did not give in the\r\nleast.\r\n\r\n\'If it\'s a trap-door--\' said Cyril. And he stopped shoving and began to\r\nfeel about with his hands.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, there is a bolt. I can\'t move it.\'\r\n\r\nBy a happy chance Cyril had in his pocket the oil-can of his father\'s\r\nbicycle; he put the carpet down at the foot of the stairs, and he lay\r\non his back, with his head on the top step and his feet straggling down\r\namong his young relations, and he oiled the bolt till the drops of rust\r\nand oil fell down on his face. One even went into his mouth--open, as he\r\npanted with the exertion of keeping up this unnatural position. Then\r\nhe tried again, but still the bolt would not move. So now he tied his\r\nhandkerchief--the one with the bacon-fat and marmalade on it--to the\r\nbolt, and Robert\'s handkerchief to that, in a reef knot, which cannot\r\ncome undone however much you pull, and, indeed, gets tighter and tighter\r\nthe more you pull it. This must not be confused with a granny knot,\r\nwhich comes undone if you look at it. And then he and Robert pulled,\r\nand the girls put their arms round their brothers and pulled too, and\r\nsuddenly the bolt gave way with a rusty scrunch, and they all rolled\r\ntogether to the bottom of the stairs--all but the Phoenix, which had\r\ntaken to its wings when the pulling began.\r\n\r\nNobody was hurt much, because the rolled-up carpet broke their fall; and\r\nnow, indeed, the shoulders of the boys were used to some purpose, for\r\nthe stone allowed them to heave it up. They felt it give; dust fell\r\nfreely on them.\r\n\r\n\'Now, then,\' cried Robert, forgetting his head and his temper, \'push all\r\ntogether. One, two, three!\'\r\n\r\nThe stone was heaved up. It swung up on a creaking, unwilling hinge, and\r\nshowed a growing oblong of dazzling daylight; and it fell back with a\r\nbang against something that kept it upright. Every one climbed out,\r\nbut there was not room for every one to stand comfortably in the\r\nlittle paved house where they found themselves, so when the Phoenix had\r\nfluttered up from the darkness they let the stone down, and it closed\r\nlike a trap-door, as indeed it was.\r\n\r\nYou can have no idea how dusty and dirty the children were. Fortunately\r\nthere was no one to see them but each other. The place they were in\r\nwas a little shrine, built on the side of a road that went winding up\r\nthrough yellow-green fields to the topless tower. Below them were fields\r\nand orchards, all bare boughs and brown furrows, and little houses and\r\ngardens. The shrine was a kind of tiny chapel with no front wall--just a\r\nplace for people to stop and rest in and wish to be good. So the Phoenix\r\ntold them. There was an image that had once been brightly coloured, but\r\nthe rain and snow had beaten in through the open front of the shrine,\r\nand the poor image was dull and weather-stained. Under it was written:\r\n\'St Jean de Luz. Priez pour nous.\' It was a sad little place, very\r\nneglected and lonely, and yet it was nice, Anthea thought, that poor\r\ntravellers should come to this little rest-house in the hurry and worry\r\nof their journeyings and be quiet for a few minutes, and think about\r\nbeing good. The thought of St Jean de Luz--who had, no doubt, in his\r\ntime, been very good and kind--made Anthea want more than ever to do\r\nsomething kind and good.\r\n\r\n\'Tell us,\' she said to the Phoenix, \'what is the good and kind action\r\nthe carpet brought us here to do?\'\r\n\r\n\'I think it would be kind to find the owners of the treasure and tell\r\nthem about it,\' said Cyril.\r\n\r\n\'And give it them ALL?\' said Jane.\r\n\r\n\'Yes. But whose is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I should go to the first house and ask the name of the owner of the\r\ncastle,\' said the golden bird, and really the idea seemed a good one.\r\n\r\nThey dusted each other as well as they could and went down the road. A\r\nlittle way on they found a tiny spring, bubbling out of the hillside and\r\nfalling into a rough stone basin surrounded by draggled hart\'s-tongue\r\nferns, now hardly green at all. Here the children washed their hands\r\nand faces and dried them on their pocket-handkerchiefs, which always,\r\non these occasions, seem unnaturally small. Cyril\'s and Robert\'s\r\nhandkerchiefs, indeed, rather undid the effects of the wash. But in\r\nspite of this the party certainly looked cleaner than before.\r\n\r\nThe first house they came to was a little white house with green\r\nshutters and a slate roof. It stood in a prim little garden, and down\r\neach side of the neat path were large stone vases for flowers to grow\r\nin; but all the flowers were dead now.\r\n\r\nAlong one side of the house was a sort of wide veranda, built of poles\r\nand trellis-work, and a vine crawled all over it. It was wider than our\r\nEnglish verandas, and Anthea thought it must look lovely when the\r\ngreen leaves and the grapes were there; but now there were only dry,\r\nreddish-brown stalks and stems, with a few withered leaves caught in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe children walked up to the front door. It was green and narrow. A\r\nchain with a handle hung beside it, and joined itself quite openly to a\r\nrusty bell that hung under the porch. Cyril had pulled the bell and\r\nits noisy clang was dying away before the terrible thought came to all.\r\nCyril spoke it.\r\n\r\n\'My hat!\' he breathed. \'We don\'t know any French!\'\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door opened. A very tall, lean lady, with pale\r\nringlets like whitey-brown paper or oak shavings, stood before them. She\r\nhad an ugly grey dress and a black silk apron. Her eyes were small\r\nand grey and not pretty, and the rims were red, as though she had been\r\ncrying.\r\n\r\nShe addressed the party in something that sounded like a foreign\r\nlanguage, and ended with something which they were sure was a question.\r\nOf course, no one could answer it.\r\n\r\n\'What does she say?\' Robert asked, looking down into the hollow of his\r\njacket, where the Phoenix was nestling. But before the Phoenix could\r\nanswer, the whitey-brown lady\'s face was lighted up by a most charming\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\'You--you ar-r-re fr-r-rom the England!\' she cried. \'I love so much\r\nthe England. Mais entrez--entrez donc tous! Enter, then--enter all. One\r\nessuyes his feet on the carpet.\' She pointed to the mat.\r\n\r\n\'We only wanted to ask--\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall say you all that what you wish,\' said the lady. \'Enter only!\'\r\n\r\nSo they all went in, wiping their feet on a very clean mat, and putting\r\nthe carpet in a safe corner of the veranda.\r\n\r\n\'The most beautiful days of my life,\' said the lady, as she shut the\r\ndoor, \'did pass themselves in England. And since long time I have not\r\nheard an English voice to repeal me the past.\'\r\n\r\nThis warm welcome embarrassed every one, but most the boys, for the\r\nfloor of the hall was of such very clean red and white tiles, and\r\nthe floor of the sitting-room so very shiny--like a black\r\nlooking-glass--that each felt as though he had on far more boots than\r\nusual, and far noisier.\r\n\r\nThere was a wood fire, very small and very bright, on the hearth--neat\r\nlittle logs laid on brass fire-dogs. Some portraits of powdered ladies\r\nand gentlemen hung in oval frames on the pale walls. There were silver\r\ncandlesticks on the mantelpiece, and there were chairs and a table, very\r\nslim and polite, with slender legs. The room was extremely bare, but\r\nwith a bright foreign bareness that was very cheerful, in an odd way of\r\nits own. At the end of the polished table a very un-English little boy\r\nsat on a footstool in a high-backed, uncomfortable-looking chair. He\r\nwore black velvet, and the kind of collar--all frills and lacey--that\r\nRobert would rather have died than wear; but then the little French boy\r\nwas much younger than Robert.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, how pretty!\' said every one. But no one meant the little French\r\nboy, with the velvety short knickerbockers and the velvety short hair.\r\n\r\nWhat every one admired was a little, little Christmas-tree, very green,\r\nand standing in a very red little flower-pot, and hung round with very\r\nbright little things made of tinsel and coloured paper. There were tiny\r\ncandles on the tree, but they were not lighted yet.\r\n\r\n\'But yes--is it not that it is genteel?\' said the lady. \'Sit down you\r\nthen, and let us see.\'\r\n\r\nThe children sat down in a row on the stiff chairs against the wall, and\r\nthe lady lighted a long, slim red taper at the wood flame, and then she\r\ndrew the curtains and lit the little candles, and when they were all\r\nlighted the little French boy suddenly shouted, \'Bravo, ma tante! Oh,\r\nque c\'est gentil,\' and the English children shouted \'Hooray!\'\r\n\r\nThen there was a struggle in the breast of Robert, and out fluttered the\r\nPhoenix--spread his gold wings, flew to the top of the Christmas-tree,\r\nand perched there.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! catch it, then,\' cried the lady; \'it will itself burn--your genteel\r\nparrakeet!\'\r\n\r\n\'It won\'t,\' said Robert, \'thank you.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the little French boy clapped his clean and tidy hands; but the lady\r\nwas so anxious that the Phoenix fluttered down and walked up and down on\r\nthe shiny walnut-wood table.\r\n\r\n\'Is it that it talks?\' asked the lady.\r\n\r\nAnd the Phoenix replied in excellent French. It said, \'Parfaitement,\r\nmadame!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, the pretty parrakeet,\' said the lady. \'Can it say still of other\r\nthings?\'\r\n\r\nAnd the Phoenix replied, this time in English, \'Why are you sad so near\r\nChristmas-time?\'\r\n\r\nThe children looked at it with one gasp of horror and surprise, for\r\nthe youngest of them knew that it is far from manners to notice that\r\nstrangers have been crying, and much worse to ask them the reason of\r\ntheir tears. And, of course, the lady began to cry again, very much\r\nindeed, after calling the Phoenix a bird without a heart; and she could\r\nnot find her handkerchief, so Anthea offered hers, which was still very\r\ndamp and no use at all. She also hugged the lady, and this seemed to be\r\nof more use than the handkerchief, so that presently the lady stopped\r\ncrying, and found her own handkerchief and dried her eyes, and called\r\nAnthea a cherished angel.\r\n\r\n\'I am sorry we came just when you were so sad,\' said Anthea, \'but we\r\nreally only wanted to ask you whose that castle is on the hill.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, my little angel,\' said the poor lady, sniffing, \'to-day and for\r\nhundreds of years the castle is to us, to our family. To-morrow it must\r\nthat I sell it to some strangers--and my little Henri, who ignores\r\nall, he will not have never the lands paternal. But what will you? His\r\nfather, my brother--Mr the Marquis--has spent much of money, and it the\r\nmust, despite the sentiments of familial respect, that I admit that my\r\nsainted father he also--\'\r\n\r\n\'How would you feel if you found a lot of money--hundreds and thousands\r\nof gold pieces?\' asked Cyril.\r\n\r\nThe lady smiled sadly.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! one has already recounted to you the legend?\' she said. \'It is\r\ntrue that one says that it is long time; oh! but long time, one of our\r\nancestors has hid a treasure--of gold, and of gold, and of gold--enough\r\nto enrich my little Henri for the life. But all that, my children, it is\r\nbut the accounts of fays--\'\r\n\r\n\'She means fairy stories,\' whispered the Phoenix to Robert. \'Tell her\r\nwhat you have found.\'\r\n\r\nSo Robert told, while Anthea and Jane hugged the lady for fear she\r\nshould faint for joy, like people in books, and they hugged her with the\r\nearnest, joyous hugs of unselfish delight.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s no use explaining how we got in,\' said Robert, when he had told\r\nof the finding of the treasure, \'because you would find it a little\r\ndifficult to understand, and much more difficult to believe. But we can\r\nshow you where the gold is and help you to fetch it away.\'\r\n\r\nThe lady looked doubtfully at Robert as she absently returned the hugs\r\nof the girls.\r\n\r\n\'No, he\'s not making it up,\' said Anthea; \'it\'s true, TRUE, TRUE!--and\r\nwe are so glad.\'\r\n\r\n\'You would not be capable to torment an old woman?\' she said; \'and it is\r\nnot possible that it be a dream.\'\r\n\r\n\'It really IS true,\' said Cyril; \'and I congratulate you very much.\'\r\n\r\nHis tone of studied politeness seemed to convince more than the raptures\r\nof the others.\r\n\r\n\'If I do not dream,\' she said, \'Henri come to Manon--and you--you shall\r\ncome all with me to Mr the Curate. Is it not?\'\r\n\r\nManon was a wrinkled old woman with a red and yellow handkerchief\r\ntwisted round her head. She took Henri, who was already sleepy with the\r\nexcitement of his Christmas-tree and his visitors, and when the lady had\r\nput on a stiff black cape and a wonderful black silk bonnet and a pair\r\nof black wooden clogs over her black cashmere house-boots, the whole\r\nparty went down the road to a little white house--very like the one they\r\nhad left--where an old priest, with a good face, welcomed them with a\r\npoliteness so great that it hid his astonishment.\r\n\r\nThe lady, with her French waving hands and her shrugging French\r\nshoulders and her trembling French speech, told the story. And now the\r\npriest, who knew no English, shrugged HIS shoulders and waved HIS hands\r\nand spoke also in French.\r\n\r\n\'He thinks,\' whispered the Phoenix, \'that her troubles have turned her\r\nbrain. What a pity you know no French!\'\r\n\r\n\'I do know a lot of French,\' whispered Robert, indignantly; \'but it\'s\r\nall about the pencil of the gardener\'s son and the penknife of the\r\nbaker\'s niece--nothing that anyone ever wants to say.\'\r\n\r\n\'If _I_ speak,\' the bird whispered, \'he\'ll think HE\'S mad, too.\'\r\n\r\n\'Tell me what to say.\'\r\n\r\n\'Say "C\'est vrai, monsieur. Venez donc voir,"\' said the Phoenix; and\r\nthen Robert earned the undying respect of everybody by suddenly saying,\r\nvery loudly and distinctly--\r\n\r\n\'Say vray, mossoo; venny dong vwaw.\'\r\n\r\nThe priest was disappointed when he found that Robert\'s French began and\r\nended with these useful words; but, at any rate, he saw that if the lady\r\nwas mad she was not the only one, and he put on a big beavery hat, and\r\ngot a candle and matches and a spade, and they all went up the hill to\r\nthe wayside shrine of St John of Luz.\r\n\r\n\'Now,\' said Robert, \'I will go first and show you where it is.\'\r\n\r\nSo they prised the stone up with a corner of the spade, and Robert did\r\ngo first, and they all followed and found the golden treasure exactly as\r\nthey had left it. And every one was flushed with the joy of performing\r\nsuch a wonderfully kind action.\r\n\r\nThen the lady and the priest clasped hands and wept for joy, as French\r\npeople do, and knelt down and touched the money, and talked very fast\r\nand both together, and the lady embraced all the children three times\r\neach, and called them \'little garden angels,\' and then she and the\r\npriest shook each other by both hands again, and talked, and talked, and\r\ntalked, faster and more Frenchy than you would have believed possible.\r\nAnd the children were struck dumb with joy and pleasure.\r\n\r\n\'Get away NOW,\' said the Phoenix softly, breaking in on the radiant\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nSo the children crept away, and out through the little shrine, and the\r\nlady and the priest were so tearfully, talkatively happy that they never\r\nnoticed that the guardian angels had gone.\r\n\r\nThe \'garden angels\' ran down the hill to the lady\'s little house, where\r\nthey had left the carpet on the veranda, and they spread it out and\r\nsaid \'Home,\' and no one saw them disappear, except little Henri, who\r\nhad flattened his nose into a white button against the window-glass, and\r\nwhen he tried to tell his aunt she thought he had been dreaming. So that\r\nwas all right.\r\n\r\n\'It is much the best thing we\'ve done,\' said Anthea, when they talked\r\nit over at tea-time. \'In the future we\'ll only do kind actions with the\r\ncarpet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ahem!\' said the Phoenix.\r\n\r\n\'I beg your pardon?\' said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, nothing,\' said the bird. \'I was only thinking!\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. MEWS FROM PERSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you hear that the four children found themselves at Waterloo\r\nStation quite un-taken-care-of, and with no one to meet them, it may\r\nmake you think that their parents were neither kind nor careful. But if\r\nyou think this you will be wrong. The fact is, mother arranged with Aunt\r\nEmma that she was to meet the children at Waterloo, when they went back\r\nfrom their Christmas holiday at Lyndhurst. The train was fixed, but not\r\nthe day. Then mother wrote to Aunt Emma, giving her careful instructions\r\nabout the day and the hour, and about luggage and cabs and things, and\r\ngave the letter to Robert to post. But the hounds happened to meet near\r\nRufus Stone that morning, and what is more, on the way to the meet they\r\nmet Robert, and Robert met them, and instantly forgot all about posting\r\nAunt Emma\'s letter, and never thought of it again until he and\r\nthe others had wandered three times up and down the platform at\r\nWaterloo--which makes six in all--and had bumped against old gentlemen,\r\nand stared in the faces of ladies, and been shoved by people in a hurry,\r\nand \'by-your-leaved\' by porters with trucks, and were quite, quite sure\r\nthat Aunt Emma was not there. Then suddenly the true truth of what he\r\nhad forgotten to do came home to Robert, and he said, \'Oh, crikey!\' and\r\nstood still with his mouth open, and let a porter with a Gladstone bag\r\nin each hand and a bundle of umbrellas under one arm blunder heavily\r\ninto him, and never so much as said, \'Where are you shoving to now?\' or,\r\n\'Look out where you\'re going, can\'t you?\' The heavier bag smote him at\r\nthe knee, and he staggered, but he said nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen the others understood what was the matter I think they told Robert\r\nwhat they thought of him.\r\n\r\n\'We must take the train to Croydon,\' said Anthea, \'and find Aunt Emma.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Cyril, \'and precious pleased those Jevonses would be to see\r\nus and our traps.\'\r\n\r\nAunt Emma, indeed, was staying with some Jevonses--very prim people.\r\nThey were middle-aged and wore very smart blouses, and they were fond of\r\nmatinees and shopping, and they did not care about children.\r\n\r\n\'I know MOTHER would be pleased to see us if we went back,\' said Jane.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, she would, but she\'d think it was not right to show she was\r\npleased, because it\'s Bob\'s fault we\'re not met. Don\'t I know the sort\r\nof thing?\' said Cyril. \'Besides, we\'ve no tin. No; we\'ve got enough for\r\na growler among us, but not enough for tickets to the New Forest. We\r\nmust just go home. They won\'t be so savage when they find we\'ve really\r\ngot home all right. You know auntie was only going to take us home in a\r\ncab.\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe we ought to go to Croydon,\' Anthea insisted.\r\n\r\n\'Aunt Emma would be out to a dead cert,\' said Robert. \'Those Jevonses go\r\nto the theatre every afternoon, I believe. Besides, there\'s the Phoenix\r\nat home, AND the carpet. I votes we call a four-wheeled cabman.\'\r\n\r\nA four-wheeled cabman was called--his cab was one of the old-fashioned\r\nkind with straw in the bottom--and he was asked by Anthea to drive them\r\nvery carefully to their address. This he did, and the price he asked\r\nfor doing so was exactly the value of the gold coin grandpapa had given\r\nCyril for Christmas. This cast a gloom; but Cyril would never have\r\nstooped to argue about a cab-fare, for fear the cabman should think he\r\nwas not accustomed to take cabs whenever he wanted them. For a reason\r\nthat was something like this he told the cabman to put the luggage\r\non the steps, and waited till the wheels of the growler had grittily\r\nretired before he rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\'You see,\' he said, with his hand on the handle, \'we don\'t want cook\r\nand Eliza asking us before HIM how it is we\'ve come home alone, as if we\r\nwere babies.\'\r\n\r\nHere he rang the bell; and the moment its answering clang was heard,\r\nevery one felt that it would be some time before that bell was answered.\r\nThe sound of a bell is quite different, somehow, when there is anyone\r\ninside the house who hears it. I can\'t tell you why that is--but so it\r\nis.\r\n\r\n\'I expect they\'re changing their dresses,\' said Jane.\r\n\r\n\'Too late,\' said Anthea, \'it must be past five. I expect Eliza\'s gone to\r\npost a letter, and cook\'s gone to see the time.\'\r\n\r\nCyril rang again. And the bell did its best to inform the listening\r\nchildren that there was really no one human in the house. They rang\r\nagain and listened intently. The hearts of all sank low. It is a\r\nterrible thing to be locked out of your own house, on a dark, muggy\r\nJanuary evening.\r\n\r\n\'There is no gas on anywhere,\' said Jane, in a broken voice.\r\n\r\n\'I expect they\'ve left the gas on once too often, and the draught blew\r\nit out, and they\'re suffocated in their beds. Father always said they\r\nwould some day,\' said Robert cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s go and fetch a policeman,\' said Anthea, trembling.\r\n\r\n\'And be taken up for trying to be burglars--no, thank you,\' said Cyril.\r\n\'I heard father read out of the paper about a young man who got into his\r\nown mother\'s house, and they got him made a burglar only the other day.\'\r\n\r\n\'I only hope the gas hasn\'t hurt the Phoenix,\' said Anthea. \'It said it\r\nwanted to stay in the bathroom cupboard, and I thought it would be all\r\nright, because the servants never clean that out. But if it\'s gone and\r\ngot out and been choked by gas--And besides, directly we open the door\r\nwe shall be choked, too. I KNEW we ought to have gone to Aunt Emma, at\r\nCroydon. Oh, Squirrel, I wish we had. Let\'s go NOW.\'\r\n\r\n\'Shut up,\' said her brother, briefly. \'There\'s some one rattling the\r\nlatch inside.\' Every one listened with all its ears, and every one stood\r\nback as far from the door as the steps would allow.\r\n\r\nThe latch rattled, and clicked. Then the flap of the letter-box lifted\r\nitself--every one saw it by the flickering light of the gas-lamp that\r\nshone through the leafless lime-tree by the gate--a golden eye seemed to\r\nwink at them through the letter-slit, and a cautious beak whispered--\r\n\r\n\'Are you alone?\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s the Phoenix,\' said every one, in a voice so joyous, and so full of\r\nrelief, as to be a sort of whispered shout.\r\n\r\n\'Hush!\' said the voice from the letter-box slit. \'Your slaves have gone\r\na-merry-making. The latch of this portal is too stiff for my beak.\r\nBut at the side--the little window above the shelf whereon your bread\r\nlies--it is not fastened.\'\r\n\r\n\'Righto!\' said Cyril.\r\n\r\nAnd Anthea added, \'I wish you\'d meet us there, dear Phoenix.\'\r\n\r\nThe children crept round to the pantry window. It is at the side of the\r\nhouse, and there is a green gate labelled \'Tradesmen\'s Entrance\', which\r\nis always kept bolted. But if you get one foot on the fence between you\r\nand next door, and one on the handle of the gate, you are over before\r\nyou know where you are. This, at least, was the experience of Cyril and\r\nRobert, and even, if the truth must be told, of Anthea and Jane. So in\r\nalmost no time all four were in the narrow gravelled passage that runs\r\nbetween that house and the next.\r\n\r\nThen Robert made a back, and Cyril hoisted himself up and got his\r\nknicker-bockered knee on the concrete window-sill. He dived into the\r\npantry head first, as one dives into water, and his legs waved in the\r\nair as he went, just as your legs do when you are first beginning\r\nto learn to dive. The soles of his boots--squarish muddy\r\npatches--disappeared.\r\n\r\n\'Give me a leg up,\' said Robert to his sisters.\r\n\r\n\'No, you don\'t,\' said Jane firmly. \'I\'m not going to be left outside\r\nhere with just Anthea, and have something creep up behind us out of the\r\ndark. Squirrel can go and open the back door.\'\r\n\r\nA light had sprung awake in the pantry. Cyril always said the Phoenix\r\nturned the gas on with its beak, and lighted it with a waft of its wing;\r\nbut he was excited at the time, and perhaps he really did it himself\r\nwith matches, and then forgot all about it. He let the others in by the\r\nback door. And when it had been bolted again the children went all over\r\nthe house and lighted every single gas-jet they could find. For they\r\ncouldn\'t help feeling that this was just the dark dreary winter\'s\r\nevening when an armed burglar might easily be expected to appear at any\r\nmoment. There is nothing like light when you are afraid of burglars--or\r\nof anything else, for that matter.\r\n\r\nAnd when all the gas-jets were lighted it was quite clear that the\r\nPhoenix had made no mistake, and that Eliza and cook were really out,\r\nand that there was no one in the house except the four children, and the\r\nPhoenix, and the carpet, and the blackbeetles who lived in the cupboards\r\non each side of the nursery fire-place. These last were very pleased\r\nthat the children had come home again, especially when Anthea had\r\nlighted the nursery fire. But, as usual, the children treated the loving\r\nlittle blackbeetles with coldness and disdain.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether you know how to light a fire? I don\'t mean how to\r\nstrike a match and set fire to the corners of the paper in a fire\r\nsomeone has laid ready, but how to lay and light a fire all by yourself.\r\nI will tell you how Anthea did it, and if ever you have to light one\r\nyourself you may remember how it is done. First, she raked out the ashes\r\nof the fire that had burned there a week ago--for Eliza had actually\r\nnever done this, though she had had plenty of time. In doing this Anthea\r\nknocked her knuckle and made it bleed. Then she laid the largest and\r\nhandsomest cinders in the bottom of the grate. Then she took a sheet\r\nof old newspaper (you ought never to light a fire with to-day\'s\r\nnewspaper--it will not burn well, and there are other reasons against\r\nit), and tore it into four quarters, and screwed each of these into a\r\nloose ball, and put them on the cinders; then she got a bundle of wood\r\nand broke the string, and stuck the sticks in so that their front ends\r\nrested on the bars, and the back ends on the back of the paper balls.\r\nIn doing this she cut her finger slightly with the string, and when she\r\nbroke it, two of the sticks jumped up and hit her on the cheek. Then she\r\nput more cinders and some bits of coal--no dust. She put most of that\r\non her hands, but there seemed to be enough left for her face. Then\r\nshe lighted the edges of the paper balls, and waited till she heard the\r\nfizz-crack-crack-fizz of the wood as it began to burn. Then she went and\r\nwashed her hands and face under the tap in the back kitchen.\r\n\r\nOf course, you need not bark your knuckles, or cut your finger, or\r\nbruise your cheek with wood, or black yourself all over; but otherwise,\r\nthis is a very good way to light a fire in London. In the real country\r\nfires are lighted in a different and prettier way.\r\n\r\nBut it is always good to wash your hands and face afterwards, wherever\r\nyou are.\r\n\r\nWhile Anthea was delighting the poor little blackbeetles with the\r\ncheerful blaze, Jane had set the table for--I was going to say tea, but\r\nthe meal of which I am speaking was not exactly tea. Let us call it a\r\ntea-ish meal. There was tea, certainly, for Anthea\'s fire blazed and\r\ncrackled so kindly that it really seemed to be affectionately inviting\r\nthe kettle to come and sit upon its lap. So the kettle was brought and\r\ntea made. But no milk could be found--so every one had six lumps of\r\nsugar to each cup instead. The things to eat, on the other hand, were\r\nnicer than usual. The boys looked about very carefully, and found in\r\nthe pantry some cold tongue, bread, butter, cheese, and part of a cold\r\npudding--very much nicer than cook ever made when they were at home. And\r\nin the kitchen cupboard was half a Christmassy cake, a pot of strawberry\r\njam, and about a pound of mixed candied fruit, with soft crumbly slabs\r\nof delicious sugar in each cup of lemon, orange, or citron.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed, as Jane said, \'a banquet fit for an Arabian Knight.\'\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix perched on Robert\'s chair, and listened kindly and\r\npolitely to all they had to tell it about their visit to Lyndhurst,\r\nand underneath the table, by just stretching a toe down rather far, the\r\nfaithful carpet could be felt by all--even by Jane, whose legs were very\r\nshort.\r\n\r\n\'Your slaves will not return to-night,\' said the Phoenix. \'They sleep\r\nunder the roof of the cook\'s stepmother\'s aunt, who is, I gather,\r\nhostess to a large party to-night in honour of her husband\'s cousin\'s\r\nsister-in-law\'s mother\'s ninetieth birthday.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think they ought to have gone without leave,\' said Anthea,\r\n\'however many relations they have, or however old they are; but I\r\nsuppose we ought to wash up.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not our business about the leave,\' said Cyril, firmly, \'but I\r\nsimply won\'t wash up for them. We got it, and we\'ll clear it away; and\r\nthen we\'ll go somewhere on the carpet. It\'s not often we get a chance\r\nof being out all night. We can go right away to the other side of the\r\nequator, to the tropical climes, and see the sun rise over the great\r\nPacific Ocean.\'\r\n\r\n\'Right you are,\' said Robert. \'I always did want to see the Southern\r\nCross and the stars as big as gas-lamps.\'\r\n\r\n\'DON\'T go,\' said Anthea, very earnestly, \'because I COULDN\'T. I\'m SURE\r\nmother wouldn\'t like us to leave the house and I should hate to be left\r\nhere alone.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'d stay with you,\' said Jane loyally.\r\n\r\n\'I know you would,\' said Anthea gratefully, \'but even with you I\'d much\r\nrather not.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Cyril, trying to be kind and amiable, \'I don\'t want you to\r\ndo anything you think\'s wrong, BUT--\'\r\n\r\nHe was silent; this silence said many things.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t see,\' Robert was beginning, when Anthea interrupted--\r\n\r\n\'I\'m quite sure. Sometimes you just think a thing\'s wrong, and sometimes\r\nyou KNOW. And this is a KNOW time.\'\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix turned kind golden eyes on her and opened a friendly beak to\r\nsay--\r\n\r\n\'When it is, as you say, a "know time", there is no more to be said. And\r\nyour noble brothers would never leave you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course not,\' said Cyril rather quickly. And Robert said so too.\r\n\r\n\'I myself,\' the Phoenix went on, \'am willing to help in any way\r\npossible. I will go personally--either by carpet or on the wing--and\r\nfetch you anything you can think of to amuse you during the evening. In\r\norder to waste no time I could go while you wash up.--Why,\' it went on\r\nin a musing voice, \'does one wash up teacups and wash down the stairs?\'\r\n\r\n\'You couldn\'t wash stairs up, you know,\' said Anthea, \'unless you began\r\nat the bottom and went up feet first as you washed. I wish cook would\r\ntry that way for a change.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t,\' said Cyril, briefly. \'I should hate the look of her\r\nelastic-side boots sticking up.\'\r\n\r\n\'This is mere trifling,\' said the Phoenix. \'Come, decide what I shall\r\nfetch for you. I can get you anything you like.\'\r\n\r\nBut of course they couldn\'t decide. Many things were suggested--a\r\nrocking-horse, jewelled chessmen, an elephant, a bicycle, a motor-car,\r\nbooks with pictures, musical instruments, and many other things. But\r\na musical instrument is agreeable only to the player, unless he has\r\nlearned to play it really well; books are not sociable, bicycles cannot\r\nbe ridden without going out of doors, and the same is true of motor-cars\r\nand elephants. Only two people can play chess at once with one set of\r\nchessmen (and anyway it\'s very much too much like lessons for a game),\r\nand only one can ride on a rocking-horse. Suddenly, in the midst of the\r\ndiscussion, the Phoenix spread its wings and fluttered to the floor, and\r\nfrom there it spoke.\r\n\r\n\'I gather,\' it said, \'from the carpet, that it wants you to let it go\r\nto its old home, where it was born and brought up, and it will return\r\nwithin the hour laden with a number of the most beautiful and delightful\r\nproducts of its native land.\'\r\n\r\n\'What IS its native land?\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t gather. But since you can\'t agree, and time is passing, and\r\nthe tea-things are not washed down--I mean washed up--\'\r\n\r\n\'I votes we do,\' said Robert. \'It\'ll stop all this jaw, anyway. And it\'s\r\nnot bad to have surprises. Perhaps it\'s a Turkey carpet, and it might\r\nbring us Turkish delight.\'\r\n\r\n\'Or a Turkish patrol,\' said Robert.\r\n\r\n\'Or a Turkish bath,\' said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'Or a Turkish towel,\' said Jane.\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense,\' Robert urged, \'it said beautiful and delightful, and towels\r\nand baths aren\'t THAT, however good they may be for you. Let it go. I\r\nsuppose it won\'t give us the slip,\' he added, pushing back his chair and\r\nstanding up.\r\n\r\n\'Hush!\' said the Phoenix; \'how can you? Don\'t trample on its feelings\r\njust because it\'s only a carpet.\'\r\n\r\n\'But how can it do it--unless one of us is on it to do the wishing?\'\r\nasked Robert. He spoke with a rising hope that it MIGHT be necessary for\r\none to go and why not Robert? But the Phoenix quickly threw cold water\r\non his new-born dream.\r\n\r\n\'Why, you just write your wish on a paper, and pin it on the carpet.\'\r\n\r\nSo a leaf was torn from Anthea\'s arithmetic book, and on it Cyril wrote\r\nin large round-hand the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nWe wish you to go to your dear native home, and bring back the most\r\nbeautiful and delightful productions of it you can--and not to be gone\r\nlong, please.\r\n\r\n                    (Signed)  CYRIL.\r\n                              ROBERT.\r\n                              ANTHEA.\r\n                              JANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the paper was laid on the carpet.\r\n\r\n\'Writing down, please,\' said the Phoenix; \'the carpet can\'t read a paper\r\nwhose back is turned to it, any more than you can.\'\r\n\r\nIt was pinned fast, and the table and chairs having been moved, the\r\ncarpet simply and suddenly vanished, rather like a patch of water on a\r\nhearth under a fierce fire. The edges got smaller and smaller, and then\r\nit disappeared from sight.\r\n\r\n\'It may take it some time to collect the beautiful and delightful\r\nthings,\' said the Phoenix. \'I should wash up--I mean wash down.\'\r\n\r\nSo they did. There was plenty of hot water left in the kettle, and every\r\none helped--even the Phoenix, who took up cups by their handles with its\r\nclever claws and dipped them in the hot water, and then stood them on\r\nthe table ready for Anthea to dry them. But the bird was rather slow,\r\nbecause, as it said, though it was not above any sort of honest work,\r\nmessing about with dish-water was not exactly what it had been brought\r\nup to. Everything was nicely washed up, and dried, and put in its proper\r\nplace, and the dish-cloth washed and hung on the edge of the copper\r\nto dry, and the tea-cloth was hung on the line that goes across the\r\nscullery. (If you are a duchess\'s child, or a king\'s, or a person of\r\nhigh social position\'s child, you will perhaps not know the difference\r\nbetween a dish-cloth and a tea-cloth; but in that case your nurse has\r\nbeen better instructed than you, and she will tell you all about it.)\r\nAnd just as eight hands and one pair of claws were being dried on the\r\nroller-towel behind the scullery door there came a strange sound from\r\nthe other side of the kitchen wall--the side where the nursery was. It\r\nwas a very strange sound, indeed--most odd, and unlike any other sounds\r\nthe children had ever heard. At least, they had heard sounds as much\r\nlike it as a toy engine\'s whistle is like a steam siren\'s.\r\n\r\n\'The carpet\'s come back,\' said Robert; and the others felt that he was\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\'But what has it brought with it?\' asked Jane. \'It sounds like\r\nLeviathan, that great beast.\'\r\n\r\n\'It couldn\'t have been made in India, and have brought elephants? Even\r\nbaby ones would be rather awful in that room,\' said Cyril. \'I vote we\r\ntake it in turns to squint through the keyhole.\'\r\n\r\nThey did--in the order of their ages. The Phoenix, being the eldest by\r\nsome thousands of years, was entitled to the first peep. But--\r\n\r\n\'Excuse me,\' it said, ruffling its golden feathers and sneezing softly;\r\n\'looking through keyholes always gives me a cold in my golden eyes.\'\r\n\r\nSo Cyril looked.\r\n\r\n\'I see something grey moving,\' said he.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a zoological garden of some sort, I bet,\' said Robert, when he had\r\ntaken his turn. And the soft rustling, bustling, ruffling, scuffling,\r\nshuffling, fluffling noise went on inside.\r\n\r\n\'_I_ can\'t see anything,\' said Anthea, \'my eye tickles so.\'\r\n\r\nThen Jane\'s turn came, and she put her eye to the keyhole.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a giant kitty-cat,\' she said; \'and it\'s asleep all over the\r\nfloor.\'\r\n\r\n\'Giant cats are tigers--father said so.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, he didn\'t. He said tigers were giant cats. It\'s not at all the same\r\nthing.\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s no use sending the carpet to fetch precious things for you\r\nif you\'re afraid to look at them when they come,\' said the Phoenix,\r\nsensibly. And Cyril, being the eldest, said--\r\n\r\n\'Come on,\' and turned the handle.\r\n\r\nThe gas had been left full on after tea, and everything in the room\r\ncould be plainly seen by the ten eyes at the door. At least, not\r\neverything, for though the carpet was there it was invisible, because it\r\nwas completely covered by the hundred and ninety-nine beautiful objects\r\nwhich it had brought from its birthplace.\r\n\r\n\'My hat!\' Cyril remarked. \'I never thought about its being a PERSIAN\r\ncarpet.\'\r\n\r\nYet it was now plain that it was so, for the beautiful objects which it\r\nhad brought back were cats--Persian cats, grey Persian cats, and there\r\nwere, as I have said, 199 of them, and they were sitting on the carpet\r\nas close as they could get to each other. But the moment the children\r\nentered the room the cats rose and stretched, and spread and overflowed\r\nfrom the carpet to the floor, and in an instant the floor was a sea of\r\nmoving, mewing pussishness, and the children with one accord climbed to\r\nthe table, and gathered up their legs, and the people next door knocked\r\non the wall--and, indeed, no wonder, for the mews were Persian and\r\npiercing.\r\n\r\n\'This is pretty poor sport,\' said Cyril. \'What\'s the matter with the\r\nbounders?\'\r\n\r\n\'I imagine that they are hungry,\' said the Phoenix. \'If you were to feed\r\nthem--\'\r\n\r\n\'We haven\'t anything to feed them with,\' said Anthea in despair, and she\r\nstroked the nearest Persian back. \'Oh, pussies, do be quiet--we can\'t\r\nhear ourselves think.\'\r\n\r\nShe had to shout this entreaty, for the mews were growing deafening,\r\n\'and it would take pounds\' and pounds\' worth of cat\'s-meat.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s ask the carpet to take them away,\' said Robert. But the girls\r\nsaid \'No.\'\r\n\r\n\'They are so soft and pussy,\' said Jane.\r\n\r\n\'And valuable,\' said Anthea, hastily. \'We can sell them for lots and\r\nlots of money.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why not send the carpet to get food for them?\' suggested the Phoenix,\r\nand its golden voice came harsh and cracked with the effort it had to be\r\nmake to be heard above the increasing fierceness of the Persian mews.\r\n\r\nSo it was written that the carpet should bring food for 199 Persian\r\ncats, and the paper was pinned to the carpet as before.\r\n\r\nThe carpet seemed to gather itself together, and the cats dropped off\r\nit, as raindrops do from your mackintosh when you shake it. And the\r\ncarpet disappeared.\r\n\r\nUnless you have had one-hundred and ninety-nine well-grown Persian cats\r\nin one small room, all hungry, and all saying so in unmistakable mews,\r\nyou can form but a poor idea of the noise that now deafened the children\r\nand the Phoenix. The cats did not seem to have been at all properly\r\nbrought up. They seemed to have no idea of its being a mistake in\r\nmanners to ask for meals in a strange house--let alone to howl for\r\nthem--and they mewed, and they mewed, and they mewed, and they mewed,\r\ntill the children poked their fingers into their ears and waited in\r\nsilent agony, wondering why the whole of Camden Town did not come\r\nknocking at the door to ask what was the matter, and only hoping that\r\nthe food for the cats would come before the neighbours did--and before\r\nall the secret of the carpet and the Phoenix had to be given away beyond\r\nrecall to an indignant neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe cats mewed and mewed and twisted their Persian forms in and out and\r\nunfolded their Persian tails, and the children and the Phoenix huddled\r\ntogether on the table.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix, Robert noticed suddenly, was trembling.\r\n\r\n\'So many cats,\' it said, \'and they might not know I was the Phoenix.\r\nThese accidents happen so quickly. It quite un-mans me.\'\r\n\r\nThis was a danger of which the children had not thought.\r\n\r\n\'Creep in,\' cried Robert, opening his jacket.\r\n\r\nAnd the Phoenix crept in--only just in time, for green eyes had glared,\r\npink noses had sniffed, white whiskers had twitched, and as Robert\r\nbuttoned his coat he disappeared to the waist in a wave of eager grey\r\nPersian fur. And on the instant the good carpet slapped itself down on\r\nthe floor. And it was covered with rats--three hundred and ninety-eight\r\nof them, I believe, two for each cat.\r\n\r\n\'How horrible!\' cried Anthea. \'Oh, take them away!\'\r\n\r\n\'Take yourself away,\' said the Phoenix, \'and me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish we\'d never had a carpet,\' said Anthea, in tears.\r\n\r\nThey hustled and crowded out of the door, and shut it, and locked it.\r\nCyril, with great presence of mind, lit a candle and turned off the gas\r\nat the main.\r\n\r\n\'The rats\'ll have a better chance in the dark,\' he said.\r\n\r\nThe mewing had ceased. Every one listened in breathless silence. We all\r\nknow that cats eat rats--it is one of the first things we read in our\r\nlittle brown reading books; but all those cats eating all those rats--it\r\nwouldn\'t bear thinking of.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Robert sniffed, in the silence of the dark kitchen, where the\r\nonly candle was burning all on one side, because of the draught.\r\n\r\n\'What a funny scent!\' he said.\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke, a lantern flashed its light through the window of the\r\nkitchen, a face peered in, and a voice said--\r\n\r\n\'What\'s all this row about? You let me in.\'\r\n\r\nIt was the voice of the police!\r\n\r\nRobert tip-toed to the window, and spoke through the pane that had\r\nbeen a little cracked since Cyril accidentally knocked it with a\r\nwalking-stick when he was playing at balancing it on his nose. (It was\r\nafter they had been to a circus.)\r\n\r\n\'What do you mean?\' he said. \'There\'s no row. You listen; everything\'s\r\nas quiet as quiet.\' And indeed it was.\r\n\r\nThe strange sweet scent grew stronger, and the Phoenix put out its beak.\r\n\r\nThe policeman hesitated.\r\n\r\n\'They\'re MUSK-rats,\' said the Phoenix. \'I suppose some cats eat\r\nthem--but never Persian ones. What a mistake for a well-informed carpet\r\nto make! Oh, what a night we\'re having!\'\r\n\r\n\'Do go away,\' said Robert, nervously. \'We\'re just going to bed--that\'s\r\nour bedroom candle; there isn\'t any row. Everything\'s as quiet as a\r\nmouse.\'\r\n\r\nA wild chorus of mews drowned his words, and with the mews were mingled\r\nthe shrieks of the musk-rats. What had happened? Had the cats tasted\r\nthem before deciding that they disliked the flavour?\r\n\r\n\'I\'m a-coming in,\' said the policeman. \'You\'ve got a cat shut up there.\'\r\n\r\n\'A cat,\' said Cyril. \'Oh, my only aunt! A cat!\'\r\n\r\n\'Come in, then,\' said Robert. \'It\'s your own look out. I advise you not.\r\nWait a shake, and I\'ll undo the side gate.\'\r\n\r\nHe undid the side gate, and the policeman, very cautiously, came in. And\r\nthere in the kitchen, by the light of one candle, with the mewing\r\nand the screaming going like a dozen steam sirens, twenty waiting on\r\nmotor-cars, and half a hundred squeaking pumps, four agitated voices\r\nshouted to the policeman four mixed and wholly different explanations of\r\nthe very mixed events of the evening.\r\n\r\nDid you ever try to explain the simplest thing to a policeman?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. THE CATS, THE COW, AND THE BURGLAR\r\n\r\nThe nursery was full of Persian cats and musk-rats that had been brought\r\nthere by the wishing carpet. The cats were mewing and the musk-rats were\r\nsqueaking so that you could hardly hear yourself speak. In the kitchen\r\nwere the four children, one candle, a concealed Phoenix, and a very\r\nvisible policeman.\r\n\r\n\'Now then, look here,\' said the Policeman, very loudly, and he pointed\r\nhis lantern at each child in turn, \'what\'s the meaning of this here\r\nyelling and caterwauling. I tell you you\'ve got a cat here, and some\r\none\'s a ill-treating of it. What do you mean by it, eh?\'\r\n\r\nIt was five to one, counting the Phoenix; but the policeman, who was\r\none, was of unusually fine size, and the five, including the Phoenix,\r\nwere small. The mews and the squeaks grew softer, and in the comparative\r\nsilence, Cyril said--\r\n\r\n\'It\'s true. There are a few cats here. But we\'ve not hurt them. It\'s\r\nquite the opposite. We\'ve just fed them.\'\r\n\r\n\'It don\'t sound like it,\' said the policeman grimly.\r\n\r\n\'I daresay they\'re not REAL cats,\' said Jane madly, perhaps they\'re only\r\ndream-cats.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll dream-cat you, my lady,\' was the brief response of the force.\r\n\r\n\'If you understood anything except people who do murders and stealings\r\nand naughty things like that, I\'d tell you all about it,\' said Robert;\r\n\'but I\'m certain you don\'t. You\'re not meant to shove your oar into\r\npeople\'s private cat-keepings. You\'re only supposed to interfere when\r\npeople shout "murder" and "stop thief" in the street. So there!\'\r\n\r\nThe policeman assured them that he should see about that; and at this\r\npoint the Phoenix, who had been making itself small on the pot-shelf\r\nunder the dresser, among the saucepan lids and the fish-kettle, walked\r\non tip-toed claws in a noiseless and modest manner, and left the room\r\nunnoticed by any one.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, don\'t be so horrid,\' Anthea was saying, gently and earnestly. \'We\r\nLOVE cats--dear pussy-soft things. We wouldn\'t hurt them for worlds.\r\nWould we, Pussy?\'\r\n\r\nAnd Jane answered that of course they wouldn\'t. And still the policeman\r\nseemed unmoved by their eloquence.\r\n\r\n\'Now, look here,\' he said, \'I\'m a-going to see what\'s in that room\r\nbeyond there, and--\'\r\n\r\nHis voice was drowned in a wild burst of mewing and squeaking. And as\r\nsoon as it died down all four children began to explain at once; and\r\nthough the squeaking and mewing were not at their very loudest, yet\r\nthere was quite enough of both to make it very hard for the policeman\r\nto understand a single word of any of the four wholly different\r\nexplanations now poured out to him.\r\n\r\n\'Stow it,\' he said at last. \'I\'m a-goin\' into the next room in the\r\nexecution of my duty. I\'m a-goin\' to use my eyes--my ears have gone off\r\ntheir chumps, what with you and them cats.\'\r\n\r\nAnd he pushed Robert aside, and strode through the door.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t say I didn\'t warn you,\' said Robert.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s tigers REALLY,\' said Jane. \'Father said so. I wouldn\'t go in, if I\r\nwere you.\'\r\n\r\nBut the policeman was quite stony; nothing any one said seemed to make\r\nany difference to him. Some policemen are like this, I believe. He\r\nstrode down the passage, and in another moment he would have been in the\r\nroom with all the cats and all the rats (musk), but at that very instant\r\na thin, sharp voice screamed from the street outside--\r\n\r\n\'Murder--murder! Stop thief!\'\r\n\r\nThe policeman stopped, with one regulation boot heavily poised in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\'Eh?\' he said.\r\n\r\nAnd again the shrieks sounded shrilly and piercingly from the dark\r\nstreet outside.\r\n\r\n\'Come on,\' said Robert. \'Come and look after cats while somebody\'s being\r\nkilled outside.\' For Robert had an inside feeling that told him quite\r\nplainly WHO it was that was screaming.\r\n\r\n\'You young rip,\' said the policeman, \'I\'ll settle up with you bimeby.\'\r\n\r\nAnd he rushed out, and the children heard his boots going weightily\r\nalong the pavement, and the screams also going along, rather ahead of\r\nthe policeman; and both the murder-screams and the policeman\'s boots\r\nfaded away in the remote distance.\r\n\r\nThen Robert smacked his knickerbocker loudly with his palm, and said--\r\n\r\n\'Good old Phoenix! I should know its golden voice anywhere.\'\r\n\r\nAnd then every one understood how cleverly the Phoenix had caught at\r\nwhat Robert had said about the real work of a policeman being to look\r\nafter murderers and thieves, and not after cats, and all hearts were\r\nfilled with admiring affection.\r\n\r\n\'But he\'ll come back,\' said Anthea, mournfully, \'as soon as it finds the\r\nmurderer is only a bright vision of a dream, and there isn\'t one at all\r\nreally.\'\r\n\r\n\'No he won\'t,\' said the soft voice of the clever Phoenix, as it flew\r\nin. \'HE DOES NOT KNOW WHERE YOUR HOUSE IS. I heard him own as much to a\r\nfellow mercenary. Oh! what a night we are having! Lock the door, and let\r\nus rid ourselves of this intolerable smell of the perfume peculiar\r\nto the musk-rat and to the house of the trimmers of beards. If you\'ll\r\nexcuse me, I will go to bed. I am worn out.\'\r\n\r\nIt was Cyril who wrote the paper that told the carpet to take away the\r\nrats and bring milk, because there seemed to be no doubt in any breast\r\nthat, however Persian cats may be, they must like milk.\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s hope it won\'t be musk-milk,\' said Anthea, in gloom, as she pinned\r\nthe paper face-downwards on the carpet. \'Is there such a thing as a\r\nmusk-cow?\' she added anxiously, as the carpet shrivelled and vanished.\r\n\'I do hope not. Perhaps really it WOULD have been wiser to let the\r\ncarpet take the cats away. It\'s getting quite late, and we can\'t keep\r\nthem all night.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, can\'t we?\' was the bitter rejoinder of Robert, who had been\r\nfastening the side door. \'You might have consulted me,\' he went on. \'I\'m\r\nnot such an idiot as some people.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, whatever--\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you see? We\'ve jolly well GOT to keep the cats all night--oh, get\r\ndown, you furry beasts!--because we\'ve had three wishes out of the old\r\ncarpet now, and we can\'t get any more till to-morrow.\'\r\n\r\nThe liveliness of Persian mews alone prevented the occurrence of a\r\ndismal silence.\r\n\r\nAnthea spoke first.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind,\' she said. \'Do you know, I really do think they\'re quieting\r\ndown a bit. Perhaps they heard us say milk.\'\r\n\r\n\'They can\'t understand English,\' said Jane. \'You forget they\'re Persian\r\ncats, Panther.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Anthea, rather sharply, for she was tired and anxious, \'who\r\ntold you "milk" wasn\'t Persian for milk. Lots of English words are\r\njust the same in French--at least I know "miaw" is, and "croquet", and\r\n"fiance". Oh, pussies, do be quiet! Let\'s stroke them as hard as we can\r\nwith both hands, and perhaps they\'ll stop.\'\r\n\r\nSo every one stroked grey fur till their hands were tired, and as soon\r\nas a cat had been stroked enough to make it stop mewing it was pushed\r\ngently away, and another mewing mouser was approached by the hands of\r\nthe strokers. And the noise was really more than half purr when the\r\ncarpet suddenly appeared in its proper place, and on it, instead of rows\r\nof milk-cans, or even of milk-jugs, there was a COW. Not a Persian cow,\r\neither, nor, most fortunately, a musk-cow, if there is such a thing, but\r\na smooth, sleek, dun-coloured Jersey cow, who blinked large soft eyes at\r\nthe gas-light and mooed in an amiable if rather inquiring manner.\r\n\r\nAnthea had always been afraid of cows; but now she tried to be brave.\r\n\r\n\'Anyway, it can\'t run after me,\' she said to herself \'There isn\'t room\r\nfor it even to begin to run.\'\r\n\r\nThe cow was perfectly placid. She behaved like a strayed duchess till\r\nsome one brought a saucer for the milk, and some one else tried to milk\r\nthe cow into it. Milking is very difficult. You may think it is easy,\r\nbut it is not. All the children were by this time strung up to a pitch\r\nof heroism that would have been impossible to them in their ordinary\r\ncondition. Robert and Cyril held the cow by the horns; and Jane, when\r\nshe was quite sure that their end of the cow was quite secure, consented\r\nto stand by, ready to hold the cow by the tail should occasion arise.\r\nAnthea, holding the saucer, now advanced towards the cow. She remembered\r\nto have heard that cows, when milked by strangers, are susceptible to\r\nthe soothing influence of the human voice. So, clutching her saucer very\r\ntight, she sought for words to whose soothing influence the cow might be\r\nsusceptible. And her memory, troubled by the events of the night, which\r\nseemed to go on and on for ever and ever, refused to help her with any\r\nform of words suitable to address a Jersey cow in.\r\n\r\n\'Poor pussy, then. Lie down, then, good dog, lie down!\' was all that she\r\ncould think of to say, and she said it.\r\n\r\nAnd nobody laughed. The situation, full of grey mewing cats, was too\r\nserious for that. Then Anthea, with a beating heart, tried to milk the\r\ncow. Next moment the cow had knocked the saucer out of her hand and\r\ntrampled on it with one foot, while with the other three she had walked\r\non a foot each of Robert, Cyril, and Jane.\r\n\r\nJane burst into tears. \'Oh, how much too horrid everything is!\' she\r\ncried. \'Come away. Let\'s go to bed and leave the horrid cats with the\r\nhateful cow. Perhaps somebody will eat somebody else. And serve them\r\nright.\'\r\n\r\nThey did not go to bed, but they had a shivering council in the\r\ndrawing-room, which smelt of soot--and, indeed, a heap of this lay in\r\nthe fender. There had been no fire in the room since mother went\r\naway, and all the chairs and tables were in the wrong places, and the\r\nchrysanthemums were dead, and the water in the pot nearly dried up.\r\nAnthea wrapped the embroidered woolly sofa blanket round Jane and\r\nherself, while Robert and Cyril had a struggle, silent and brief, but\r\nfierce, for the larger share of the fur hearthrug.\r\n\r\n\'It is most truly awful,\' said Anthea, \'and I am so tired. Let\'s let the\r\ncats loose.\'\r\n\r\n\'And the cow, perhaps?\' said Cyril. \'The police would find us at once.\r\nThat cow would stand at the gate and mew--I mean moo--to come in. And so\r\nwould the cats. No; I see quite well what we\'ve got to do. We must\r\nput them in baskets and leave them on people\'s doorsteps, like orphan\r\nfoundlings.\'\r\n\r\n\'We\'ve got three baskets, counting mother\'s work one,\' said Jane\r\nbrightening.\r\n\r\n\'And there are nearly two hundred cats,\' said Anthea, \'besides the\r\ncow--and it would have to be a different-sized basket for her; and then\r\nI don\'t know how you\'d carry it, and you\'d never find a doorstep big\r\nenough to put it on. Except the church one--and--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, well,\' said Cyril, \'if you simply MAKE difficulties--\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m with you,\' said Robert. \'Don\'t fuss about the cow, Panther. It\'s\r\nsimply GOT to stay the night, and I\'m sure I\'ve read that the cow is a\r\nremunerating creature, and that means it will sit still and think\r\nfor hours. The carpet can take it away in the morning. And as for the\r\nbaskets, we\'ll do them up in dusters, or pillow-cases, or bath-towels.\r\nCome on, Squirrel. You girls can be out of it if you like.\'\r\n\r\nHis tone was full of contempt, but Jane and Anthea were too tired and\r\ndesperate to care; even being \'out of it\', which at other times they\r\ncould not have borne, now seemed quite a comfort. They snuggled down in\r\nthe sofa blanket, and Cyril threw the fur hearthrug over them.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, he said, \'that\'s all women are fit for--to keep safe and warm,\r\nwhile the men do the work and run dangers and risks and things.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m not,\' said Anthea, \'you know I\'m not.\' But Cyril was gone.\r\n\r\nIt was warm under the blanket and the hearthrug, and Jane snuggled up\r\nclose to her sister; and Anthea cuddled Jane closely and kindly, and in\r\na sort of dream they heard the rise of a wave of mewing as Robert opened\r\nthe door of the nursery. They heard the booted search for baskets in\r\nthe back kitchen. They heard the side door open and close, and they\r\nknew that each brother had gone out with at least one cat. Anthea\'s\r\nlast thought was that it would take at least all night to get rid of\r\none hundred and ninety-nine cats by twos. There would be ninety-nine\r\njourneys of two cats each, and one cat over.\r\n\r\n\'I almost think we might keep the one cat over,\' said Anthea. \'I don\'t\r\nseem to care for cats just now, but I daresay I shall again some day.\'\r\nAnd she fell asleep. Jane also was sleeping.\r\n\r\nIt was Jane who awoke with a start, to find Anthea still asleep. As, in\r\nthe act of awakening, she kicked her sister, she wondered idly why\r\nthey should have gone to bed in their boots; but the next moment she\r\nremembered where they were.\r\n\r\nThere was a sound of muffled, shuffled feet on the stairs. Like the\r\nheroine of the classic poem, Jane \'thought it was the boys\', and as\r\nshe felt quite wide awake, and not nearly so tired as before, she crept\r\ngently from Anthea\'s side and followed the footsteps. They went down\r\ninto the basement; the cats, who seemed to have fallen into the sleep\r\nof exhaustion, awoke at the sound of the approaching footsteps and mewed\r\npiteously. Jane was at the foot of the stairs before she saw it was not\r\nher brothers whose coming had roused her and the cats, but a burglar.\r\nShe knew he was a burglar at once, because he wore a fur cap and a red\r\nand black charity-check comforter, and he had no business where he was.\r\n\r\nIf you had been stood in jane\'s shoes you would no doubt have run away\r\nin them, appealing to the police and neighbours with horrid screams. But\r\nJane knew better. She had read a great many nice stories about burglars,\r\nas well as some affecting pieces of poetry, and she knew that no burglar\r\nwill ever hurt a little girl if he meets her when burgling. Indeed, in\r\nall the cases Jane had read of, his burglarishness was almost at once\r\nforgotten in the interest he felt in the little girl\'s artless prattle.\r\nSo if Jane hesitated for a moment before addressing the burglar, it\r\nwas only because she could not at once think of any remark sufficiently\r\nprattling and artless to make a beginning with. In the stories and the\r\naffecting poetry the child could never speak plainly, though it always\r\nlooked old enough to in the pictures. And Jane could not make up her\r\nmind to lisp and \'talk baby\', even to a burglar. And while she hesitated\r\nhe softly opened the nursery door and went in.\r\n\r\nJane followed--just in time to see him sit down flat on the floor,\r\nscattering cats as a stone thrown into a pool splashes water.\r\n\r\nShe closed the door softly and stood there, still wondering whether she\r\nCOULD bring herself to say, \'What\'s \'oo doing here, Mithter Wobber?\' and\r\nwhether any other kind of talk would do.\r\n\r\nThen she heard the burglar draw a long breath, and he spoke.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a judgement,\' he said, \'so help me bob if it ain\'t. Oh, \'ere\'s a\r\nthing to \'appen to a chap! Makes it come \'ome to you, don\'t it neither?\r\nCats an\' cats an\' cats. There couldn\'t be all them cats. Let alone the\r\ncow. If she ain\'t the moral of the old man\'s Daisy. She\'s a dream out of\r\nwhen I was a lad--I don\'t mind \'er so much. \'Ere, Daisy, Daisy?\'\r\n\r\nThe cow turned and looked at him.\r\n\r\n\'SHE\'S all right,\' he went on. \'Sort of company, too. Though them above\r\nknows how she got into this downstairs parlour. But them cats--oh, take\r\n\'em away, take \'em away! I\'ll chuck the \'ole show--Oh, take \'em away.\'\r\n\r\n\'Burglar,\' said Jane, close behind him, and he started convulsively,\r\nand turned on her a blank face, whose pale lips trembled. \'I can\'t take\r\nthose cats away.\'\r\n\r\n\'Lor\' lumme!\' exclaimed the man; \'if \'ere ain\'t another on \'em. Are you\r\nreal, miss, or something I\'ll wake up from presently?\'\r\n\r\n\'I am quite real,\' said Jane, relieved to find that a lisp was not\r\nneeded to make the burglar understand her. \'And so,\' she added, \'are the\r\ncats.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then send for the police, send for the police, and I\'ll go quiet. If\r\nyou ain\'t no realler than them cats, I\'m done, spunchuck--out of time.\r\nSend for the police. I\'ll go quiet. One thing, there\'d not be room for\r\n\'arf them cats in no cell as ever _I_ see.\'\r\n\r\nHe ran his fingers through his hair, which was short, and his eyes\r\nwandered wildly round the roomful of cats.\r\n\r\n\'Burglar,\' said Jane, kindly and softly, \'if you didn\'t like cats, what\r\ndid you come here for?\'\r\n\r\n\'Send for the police,\' was the unfortunate criminal\'s only reply. \'I\'d\r\nrather you would--honest, I\'d rather.\'\r\n\r\n\'I daren\'t,\' said Jane, \'and besides, I\'ve no one to send. I hate the\r\npolice. I wish he\'d never been born.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve a feeling \'art, miss,\' said the burglar; \'but them cats is\r\nreally a little bit too thick.\'\r\n\r\n\'Look here,\' said Jane, \'I won\'t call the police. And I am quite a real\r\nlittle girl, though I talk older than the kind you\'ve met before when\r\nyou\'ve been doing your burglings. And they are real cats--and they want\r\nreal milk--and--Didn\'t you say the cow was like somebody\'s Daisy that\r\nyou used to know?\'\r\n\r\n\'Wish I may die if she ain\'t the very spit of her,\' replied the man.\r\n\r\n\'Well, then,\' said Jane--and a thrill of joyful pride ran through\r\nher--\'perhaps you know how to milk cows?\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps I does,\' was the burglar\'s cautious rejoinder.\r\n\r\n\'Then,\' said Jane, \'if you will ONLY milk ours--you don\'t know how we\r\nshall always love you.\'\r\n\r\nThe burglar replied that loving was all very well.\r\n\r\n\'If those cats only had a good long, wet, thirsty drink of milk,\' Jane\r\nwent on with eager persuasion, \'they\'d lie down and go to sleep as\r\nlikely as not, and then the police won\'t come back. But if they go on\r\nmewing like this he will, and then I don\'t know what\'ll become of us, or\r\nyou either.\'\r\n\r\nThis argument seemed to decide the criminal. Jane fetched the wash-bowl\r\nfrom the sink, and he spat on his hands and prepared to milk the cow. At\r\nthis instant boots were heard on the stairs.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s all up,\' said the man, desperately, \'this \'ere\'s a plant. \'ERE\'S\r\nthe police.\' He made as if to open the window and leap from it.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s all right, I tell you,\' whispered Jane, in anguish. \'I\'ll say\r\nyou\'re a friend of mine, or the good clergyman called in, or my uncle,\r\nor ANYTHING--only do, do, do milk the cow. Oh, DON\'T go--oh--oh, thank\r\ngoodness it\'s only the boys!\'\r\n\r\nIt was; and their entrance had awakened Anthea, who, with her brothers,\r\nnow crowded through the doorway. The man looked about him like a rat\r\nlooks round a trap.\r\n\r\n\'This is a friend of mine,\' said Jane; \'he\'s just called in, and he\'s\r\ngoing to milk the cow for us. ISN\'T it good and kind of him?\'\r\n\r\nShe winked at the others, and though they did not understand they played\r\nup loyally.\r\n\r\n\'How do?\' said Cyril, \'Very glad to meet you. Don\'t let us interrupt the\r\nmilking.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall \'ave a \'ead and a \'arf in the morning, and no bloomin\' error,\'\r\nremarked the burglar; but he began to milk the cow.\r\n\r\nRobert was winked at to stay and see that he did not leave off milking\r\nor try to escape, and the others went to get things to put the milk in;\r\nfor it was now spurting and foaming in the wash-bowl, and the cats had\r\nceased from mewing and were crowding round the cow, with expressions of\r\nhope and anticipation on their whiskered faces.\r\n\r\n\'We can\'t get rid of any more cats,\' said Cyril, as he and his sisters\r\npiled a tray high with saucers and soup-plates and platters and\r\npie-dishes, \'the police nearly got us as it was. Not the same one--a\r\nmuch stronger sort. He thought it really was a foundling orphan we\'d\r\ngot. If it hadn\'t been for me throwing the two bags of cat slap in\r\nhis eye and hauling Robert over a railing, and lying like mice under\r\na laurel-bush--Well, it\'s jolly lucky I\'m a good shot, that\'s all.\r\nHe pranced off when he\'d got the cat-bags off his face--thought we\'d\r\nbolted. And here we are.\'\r\n\r\nThe gentle samishness of the milk swishing into the hand-bowl seemed\r\nto have soothed the burglar very much. He went on milking in a sort of\r\nhappy dream, while the children got a cap and ladled the warm milk out\r\ninto the pie-dishes and plates, and platters and saucers, and set them\r\ndown to the music of Persian purrs and lappings.\r\n\r\n\'It makes me think of old times,\' said the burglar, smearing his ragged\r\ncoat-cuff across his eyes--\'about the apples in the orchard at home,\r\nand the rats at threshing time, and the rabbits and the ferrets, and how\r\npretty it was seeing the pigs killed.\'\r\n\r\nFinding him in this softened mood, Jane said--\r\n\r\n\'I wish you\'d tell us how you came to choose our house for your\r\nburglaring to-night. I am awfully glad you did. You have been so kind. I\r\ndon\'t know what we should have done without you,\' she added hastily. \'We\r\nall love you ever so. Do tell us.\'\r\n\r\nThe others added their affectionate entreaties, and at last the burglar\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\'Well, it\'s my first job, and I didn\'t expect to be made so welcome, and\r\nthat\'s the truth, young gents and ladies. And I don\'t know but what it\r\nwon\'t be my last. For this \'ere cow, she reminds me of my father, and I\r\nknow \'ow \'e\'d \'ave \'ided me if I\'d laid \'ands on a \'a\'penny as wasn\'t my\r\nown.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure he would,\' Jane agreed kindly; \'but what made you come here?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, miss,\' said the burglar, \'you know best \'ow you come by them\r\ncats, and why you don\'t like the police, so I\'ll give myself away free,\r\nand trust to your noble \'earts. (You\'d best bale out a bit, the pan\'s\r\ngetting fullish.) I was a-selling oranges off of my barrow--for I ain\'t\r\na burglar by trade, though you \'ave used the name so free--an\' there was\r\na lady bought three \'a\'porth off me. An\' while she was a-pickin\' of them\r\nout--very careful indeed, and I\'m always glad when them sort gets a few\r\nover-ripe ones--there was two other ladies talkin\' over the fence. An\'\r\none on \'em said to the other on \'em just like this--\r\n\r\n"\'I\'ve told both gells to come, and they can doss in with M\'ria and\r\nJane, \'cause their boss and his missis is miles away and the kids too.\r\nSo they can just lock up the \'ouse and leave the gas a-burning, so\'s\r\nno one won\'t know, and get back bright an\' early by \'leven o\'clock. And\r\nwe\'ll make a night of it, Mrs Prosser, so we will. I\'m just a-going\r\nto run out to pop the letter in the post." And then the lady what had\r\nchosen the three ha\'porth so careful, she said: "Lor, Mrs Wigson, I\r\nwonder at you, and your hands all over suds. This good gentleman\'ll slip\r\nit into the post for yer, I\'ll be bound, seeing I\'m a customer of his."\r\nSo they give me the letter, and of course I read the direction what was\r\nwritten on it afore I shoved it into the post. And then when I\'d sold\r\nmy barrowful, I was a-goin\' \'ome with the chink in my pocket, and I\'m\r\nblowed if some bloomin\' thievin\' beggar didn\'t nick the lot whilst I was\r\njust a-wettin\' of my whistle, for callin\' of oranges is dry work. Nicked\r\nthe bloomin\' lot \'e did--and me with not a farden to take \'ome to my\r\nbrother and his missus.\'\r\n\r\n\'How awful!\' said Anthea, with much sympathy.\r\n\r\n\'Horful indeed, miss, I believe yer,\' the burglar rejoined, with deep\r\nfeeling. \'You don\'t know her temper when she\'s roused. An\' I\'m sure I\r\n\'ope you never may, neither. And I\'d \'ad all my oranges off of \'em.\r\nSo it came back to me what was wrote on the ongverlope, and I says to\r\nmyself, "Why not, seein\' as I\'ve been done myself, and if they keeps two\r\nslaveys there must be some pickings?" An\' so \'ere I am. But them cats,\r\nthey\'ve brought me back to the ways of honestness. Never no more.\'\r\n\r\n\'Look here,\' said Cyril, \'these cats are very valuable--very indeed. And\r\nwe will give them all to you, if only you will take them away.\'\r\n\r\n\'I see they\'re a breedy lot,\' replied the burglar. \'But I don\'t want no\r\nbother with the coppers. Did you come by them honest now? Straight?\'\r\n\r\n\'They are all our very own,\' said Anthea, \'we wanted them, but the\r\nconfidement--\'\r\n\r\n\'Consignment,\' whispered Cyril, \'was larger than we wanted, and they\'re\r\nan awful bother. If you got your barrow, and some sacks or baskets, your\r\nbrother\'s missus would be awfully pleased. My father says Persian cats\r\nare worth pounds and pounds each.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said the burglar--and he was certainly moved by her remarks--\'I\r\nsee you\'re in a hole--and I don\'t mind lending a helping \'and. I don\'t\r\nask \'ow you come by them. But I\'ve got a pal--\'e\'s a mark on cats. I\'ll\r\nfetch him along, and if he thinks they\'d fetch anything above their\r\nskins I don\'t mind doin\' you a kindness.\'\r\n\r\n\'You won\'t go away and never come back,\' said Jane, \'because I don\'t\r\nthink I COULD bear that.\'\r\n\r\nThe burglar, quite touched by her emotion, swore sentimentally that,\r\nalive or dead, he would come back.\r\n\r\nThen he went, and Cyril and Robert sent the girls to bed and sat up to\r\nwait for his return. It soon seemed absurd to await him in a state\r\nof wakefulness, but his stealthy tap on the window awoke them readily\r\nenough. For he did return, with the pal and the barrow and the sacks.\r\nThe pal approved of the cats, now dormant in Persian repletion, and\r\nthey were bundled into the sacks, and taken away on the barrow--mewing,\r\nindeed, but with mews too sleepy to attract public attention.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m a fence--that\'s what I am,\' said the burglar gloomily. \'I never\r\nthought I\'d come down to this, and all acause er my kind \'eart.\'\r\n\r\nCyril knew that a fence is a receiver of stolen goods, and he replied\r\nbriskly--\r\n\r\n\'I give you my sacred the cats aren\'t stolen. What do you make the\r\ntime?\'\r\n\r\n\'I ain\'t got the time on me,\' said the pal--\'but it was just about\r\nchucking-out time as I come by the "Bull and Gate". I shouldn\'t wonder\r\nif it was nigh upon one now.\'\r\n\r\nWhen the cats had been removed, and the boys and the burglar had parted\r\nwith warm expressions of friendship, there remained only the cow.\r\n\r\n\'She must stay all night,\' said Robert. \'Cook\'ll have a fit when she\r\nsees her.\'\r\n\r\n\'All night?\' said Cyril. \'Why--it\'s tomorrow morning if it\'s one. We can\r\nhave another wish!\'\r\n\r\nSo the carpet was urged, in a hastily written note, to remove the cow to\r\nwherever she belonged, and to return to its proper place on the nursery\r\nfloor. But the cow could not be got to move on to the carpet. So Robert\r\ngot the clothes line out of the back kitchen, and tied one end very\r\nfirmly to the cow\'s horns, and the other end to a bunched-up corner of\r\nthe carpet, and said \'Fire away.\'\r\n\r\nAnd the carpet and cow vanished together, and the boys went to bed,\r\ntired out and only too thankful that the evening at last was over.\r\n\r\nNext morning the carpet lay calmly in its place, but one corner was very\r\nbadly torn. It was the corner that the cow had been tied on to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. THE BURGLAR\'S BRIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning after the adventure of the Persian cats, the musk-rats, the\r\ncommon cow, and the uncommon burglar, all the children slept till it was\r\nten o\'clock; and then it was only Cyril who woke; but he attended to\r\nthe others, so that by half past ten every one was ready to help to get\r\nbreakfast. It was shivery cold, and there was but little in the house\r\nthat was really worth eating.\r\n\r\nRobert had arranged a thoughtful little surprise for the absent\r\nservants. He had made a neat and delightful booby trap over the kitchen\r\ndoor, and as soon as they heard the front door click open and knew the\r\nservants had come back, all four children hid in the cupboard under\r\nthe stairs and listened with delight to the entrance--the tumble, the\r\nsplash, the scuffle, and the remarks of the servants. They heard the\r\ncook say it was a judgement on them for leaving the place to itself;\r\nshe seemed to think that a booby trap was a kind of plant that was quite\r\nlikely to grow, all by itself, in a dwelling that was left shut up. But\r\nthe housemaid, more acute, judged that someone must have been in the\r\nhouse--a view confirmed by the sight of the breakfast things on the\r\nnursery table.\r\n\r\nThe cupboard under the stairs was very tight and paraffiny, however, and\r\na silent struggle for a place on top ended in the door bursting open\r\nand discharging Jane, who rolled like a football to the feet of the\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n\'Now,\' said Cyril, firmly, when the cook\'s hysterics had become quieter,\r\nand the housemaid had time to say what she thought of them, \'don\'t you\r\nbegin jawing us. We aren\'t going to stand it. We know too much. You\'ll\r\nplease make an extra special treacle roley for dinner, and we\'ll have a\r\ntinned tongue.\'\r\n\r\n\'I daresay,\' said the housemaid, indignant, still in her outdoor things\r\nand with her hat very much on one side. \'Don\'t you come a-threatening\r\nme, Master Cyril, because I won\'t stand it, so I tell you. You tell\r\nyour ma about us being out? Much I care! She\'ll be sorry for me when she\r\nhears about my dear great-aunt by marriage as brought me up from a child\r\nand was a mother to me. She sent for me, she did, she wasn\'t expected\r\nto last the night, from the spasms going to her legs--and cook was that\r\nkind and careful she couldn\'t let me go alone, so--\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t,\' said Anthea, in real distress. \'You know where liars go to,\r\nEliza--at least if you don\'t--\'\r\n\r\n\'Liars indeed!\' said Eliza, \'I won\'t demean myself talking to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'How\'s Mrs Wigson?\' said Robert, \'and DID you keep it up last night?\'\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the housemaid fell open.\r\n\r\n\'Did you doss with Maria or Emily?\' asked Cyril.\r\n\r\n\'How did Mrs Prosser enjoy herself?\' asked Jane.\r\n\r\n\'Forbear,\' said Cyril, \'they\'ve had enough. Whether we tell or not\r\ndepends on your later life,\' he went on, addressing the servants. \'If\r\nyou are decent to us we\'ll be decent to you. You\'d better make that\r\ntreacle roley--and if I were you, Eliza, I\'d do a little housework and\r\ncleaning, just for a change.\'\r\n\r\nThe servants gave in once and for all.\r\n\r\n\'There\'s nothing like firmness,\' Cyril went on, when the breakfast\r\nthings were cleared away and the children were alone in the nursery.\r\n\'People are always talking of difficulties with servants. It\'s quite\r\nsimple, when you know the way. We can do what we like now and they won\'t\r\npeach. I think we\'ve broken THEIR proud spirit. Let\'s go somewhere by\r\ncarpet.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wouldn\'t if I were you,\' said the Phoenix, yawning, as it swooped\r\ndown from its roost on the curtain pole. \'I\'ve given you one or two\r\nhints, but now concealment is at an end, and I see I must speak out.\'\r\n\r\nIt perched on the back of a chair and swayed to and fro, like a parrot\r\non a swing.\r\n\r\n\'What\'s the matter now?\' said Anthea. She was not quite so gentle as\r\nusual, because she was still weary from the excitement of last night\'s\r\ncats. \'I\'m tired of things happening. I shan\'t go anywhere on the\r\ncarpet. I\'m going to darn my stockings.\'\r\n\r\n\'Darn!\' said the Phoenix, \'darn! From those young lips these strange\r\nexpressions--\'\r\n\r\n\'Mend, then,\' said Anthea, \'with a needle and wool.\'\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix opened and shut its wings thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\'Your stockings,\' it said, \'are much less important than they now appear\r\nto you. But the carpet--look at the bare worn patches, look at the great\r\nrent at yonder corner. The carpet has been your faithful friend--your\r\nwilling servant. How have you requited its devoted service?\'\r\n\r\n\'Dear Phoenix,\' Anthea urged, \'don\'t talk in that horrid lecturing tone.\r\nYou make me feel as if I\'d done something wrong. And really it is a\r\nwishing carpet, and we haven\'t done anything else to it--only wishes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Only wishes,\' repeated the Phoenix, ruffling its neck feathers angrily,\r\n\'and what sort of wishes? Wishing people to be in a good temper, for\r\ninstance. What carpet did you ever hear of that had such a wish asked\r\nof it? But this noble fabric, on which you trample so recklessly\' (every\r\none removed its boots from the carpet and stood on the linoleum), \'this\r\ncarpet never flinched. It did what you asked, but the wear and tear must\r\nhave been awful. And then last night--I don\'t blame you about the cats\r\nand the rats, for those were its own choice; but what carpet could stand\r\na heavy cow hanging on to it at one corner?\'\r\n\r\n\'I should think the cats and rats were worse,\' said Robert, \'look at all\r\ntheir claws.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said the bird, \'eleven thousand nine hundred and forty of them--I\r\ndaresay you noticed? I should be surprised if these had not left their\r\nmark.\'\r\n\r\n\'Good gracious,\' said Jane, sitting down suddenly on the floor, and\r\npatting the edge of the carpet softly; \'do you mean it\'s WEARING OUT?\'\r\n\r\n\'Its life with you has not been a luxurious one,\' said the Phoenix.\r\n\r\n\'French mud twice. Sand of sunny shores twice. Soaking in southern seas\r\nonce. India once. Goodness knows where in Persia once. Musk-rat-land\r\nonce. And once, wherever the cow came from. Hold your carpet up to the\r\nlight, and with cautious tenderness, if YOU please.\'\r\n\r\nWith cautious tenderness the boys held the carpet up to the light; the\r\ngirls looked, and a shiver of regret ran through them as they saw how\r\nthose eleven thoousand nine hundred and forty claws had run through the\r\ncarpet. It was full of little holes: there were some large ones, and\r\nmore than one thin place. At one corner a strip of it was torn, and hung\r\nforlornly.\r\n\r\n\'We must mend it,\' said Anthea; \'never mind about my stockings. I can\r\nsew them up in lumps with sewing cotton if there\'s no time to do them\r\nproperly. I know it\'s awful and no girl would who respected herself,\r\nand all that; but the poor dear carpet\'s more important than my silly\r\nstockings. Let\'s go out now this very minute.\'\r\n\r\nSo out they all went, and bought wool to mend the carpet; but there\r\nis no shop in Camden Town where you can buy wishing-wool, no, nor in\r\nKentish Town either. However, ordinary Scotch heather-mixture fingering\r\nseemed good enough, and this they bought, and all that day Jane and\r\nAnthea darned and darned and darned. The boys went out for a walk in\r\nthe afternoon, and the gentle Phoenix paced up and down the table--for\r\nexercise, as it said--and talked to the industrious girls about their\r\ncarpet.\r\n\r\n\'It is not an ordinary, ignorant, innocent carpet from Kidderminster,\'\r\nit said, \'it is a carpet with a past--a Persian past. Do you know that\r\nin happier years, when that carpet was the property of caliphs, viziers,\r\nkings, and sultans, it never lay on a floor?\'\r\n\r\n\'I thought the floor was the proper home of a carpet,\' Jane interrupted.\r\n\r\n\'Not of a MAGIC carpet,\' said the Phoenix; \'why, if it had been allowed\r\nto lie about on floors there wouldn\'t be much of it left now. No,\r\nindeed! It has lived in chests of cedarwood, inlaid with pearl and\r\nivory, wrapped in priceless tissues of cloth of gold, embroidered with\r\ngems of fabulous value. It has reposed in the sandal-wood caskets of\r\nprincesses, and in the rose-attar-scented treasure-houses of kings.\r\nNever, never, had any one degraded it by walking on it--except in the\r\nway of business, when wishes were required, and then they always took\r\ntheir shoes off. And YOU--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, DON\'T!\' said Jane, very near tears. \'You know you\'d never have been\r\nhatched at all if it hadn\'t been for mother wanting a carpet for us to\r\nwalk on.\'\r\n\r\n\'You needn\'t have walked so much or so hard!\' said the bird, \'but\r\ncome, dry that crystal tear, and I will relate to you the story of the\r\nPrincess Zulieka, the Prince of Asia, and the magic carpet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Relate away,\' said Anthea--\'I mean, please do.\'\r\n\r\n\'The Princess Zulieka, fairest of royal ladies,\' began the bird, \'had in\r\nher cradle been the subject of several enchantments. Her grandmother had\r\nbeen in her day--\'\r\n\r\nBut what in her day Zulieka\'s grandmother had been was destined never to\r\nbe revealed, for Cyril and Robert suddenly burst into the room, and on\r\neach brow were the traces of deep emotion. On Cyril\'s pale brow stood\r\nbeads of agitation and perspiration, and on the scarlet brow of Robert\r\nwas a large black smear.\r\n\r\n\'What ails ye both?\' asked the Phoenix, and it added tartly that\r\nstory-telling was quite impossible if people would come interrupting\r\nlike that.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, do shut up, for any sake!\' said Cyril, sinking into a chair.\r\n\r\nRobert smoothed the ruffled golden feathers, adding kindly--\r\n\r\n\'Squirrel doesn\'t mean to be a beast. It\'s only that the MOST AWFUL\r\nthing has happened, and stories don\'t seem to matter so much. Don\'t be\r\ncross. You won\'t be when you\'ve heard what\'s happened.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, what HAS happened?\' said the bird, still rather crossly; and\r\nAnthea and Jane paused with long needles poised in air, and long\r\nneedlefuls of Scotch heather-mixture fingering wool drooping from them.\r\n\r\n\'The most awful thing you can possibly think of,\' said Cyril. \'That nice\r\nchap--our own burglar--the police have got him, on suspicion of stolen\r\ncats. That\'s what his brother\'s missis told me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, begin at the beginning!\' cried Anthea impatiently.\r\n\r\n\'Well, then, we went out, and down by where the undertaker\'s is, with\r\nthe china flowers in the window--you know. There was a crowd, and of\r\ncourse we went to have a squint. And it was two bobbies and our burglar\r\nbetween them, and he was being dragged along; and he said, "I tell you\r\nthem cats was GIVE me. I got \'em in exchange for me milking a cow in a\r\nbasement parlour up Camden Town way."\r\n\r\n\'And the people laughed. Beasts! And then one of the policemen said\r\nperhaps he could give the name and address of the cow, and he said, no,\r\nhe couldn\'t; but he could take them there if they\'d only leave go of his\r\ncoat collar, and give him a chance to get his breath. And the policeman\r\nsaid he could tell all that to the magistrate in the morning. He didn\'t\r\nsee us, and so we came away.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Cyril, how COULD you?\' said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be a pudding-head,\' Cyril advised. \'A fat lot of good it would\r\nhave done if we\'d let him see us. No one would have believed a word we\r\nsaid. They\'d have thought we were kidding. We did better than let him\r\nsee us. We asked a boy where he lived and he told us, and we went there,\r\nand it\'s a little greengrocer\'s shop, and we bought some Brazil nuts.\r\nHere they are.\' The girls waved away the Brazil nuts with loathing and\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\n\'Well, we had to buy SOMETHING, and while we were making up our minds\r\nwhat to buy we heard his brother\'s missis talking. She said when he came\r\nhome with all them miaoulers she thought there was more in it than met\r\nthe eye. But he WOULD go out this morning with the two likeliest of\r\nthem, one under each arm. She said he sent her out to buy blue ribbon to\r\nput round their beastly necks, and she said if he got three months\' hard\r\nit was her dying word that he\'d got the blue ribbon to thank for it;\r\nthat, and his own silly thieving ways, taking cats that anybody would\r\nknow he couldn\'t have come by in the way of business, instead of things\r\nthat wouldn\'t have been missed, which Lord knows there are plenty such,\r\nand--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, STOP!\' cried Jane. And indeed it was time, for Cyril seemed like a\r\nclock that had been wound up, and could not help going on. \'Where is he\r\nnow?\'\r\n\r\n\'At the police-station,\' said Robert, for Cyril was out of breath. \'The\r\nboy told us they\'d put him in the cells, and would bring him up\r\nbefore the Beak in the morning. I thought it was a jolly lark last\r\nnight--getting him to take the cats--but now--\'\r\n\r\n\'The end of a lark,\' said the Phoenix, \'is the Beak.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let\'s go to him,\' cried both the girls jumping up. \'Let\'s go and tell\r\nthe truth. They MUST believe us.\'\r\n\r\n\'They CAN\'T,\' said Cyril. \'Just think! If any one came to you with such\r\na tale, you couldn\'t believe it, however much you tried. We should only\r\nmix things up worse for him.\'\r\n\r\n\'There must be something we could do,\' said Jane, sniffing very\r\nmuch--\'my own dear pet burglar! I can\'t bear it. And he was so nice,\r\nthe way he talked about his father, and how he was going to be so extra\r\nhonest. Dear Phoenix, you MUST be able to help us. You\'re so good and\r\nkind and pretty and clever. Do, do tell us what to do.\'\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix rubbed its beak thoughtfully with its claw.\r\n\r\n\'You might rescue him,\' it said, \'and conceal him here, till the\r\nlaw-supporters had forgotten about him.\'\r\n\r\n\'That would be ages and ages,\' said Cyril, \'and we couldn\'t conceal him\r\nhere. Father might come home at any moment, and if he found the burglar\r\nhere HE wouldn\'t believe the true truth any more than the police would.\r\nThat\'s the worst of the truth. Nobody ever believes it. Couldn\'t we take\r\nhim somewhere else?\'\r\n\r\nJane clapped her hands.\r\n\r\n\'The sunny southern shore!\' she cried, \'where the cook is being queen.\r\nHe and she would be company for each other!\'\r\n\r\nAnd really the idea did not seem bad, if only he would consent to go.\r\n\r\nSo, all talking at once, the children arranged to wait till evening, and\r\nthen to seek the dear burglar in his lonely cell.\r\n\r\nMeantime Jane and Anthea darned away as hard as they could, to make the\r\ncarpet as strong as possible. For all felt how terrible it would be if\r\nthe precious burglar, while being carried to the sunny southern shore,\r\nwere to tumble through a hole in the carpet, and be lost for ever in the\r\nsunny southern sea.\r\n\r\nThe servants were tired after Mrs Wigson\'s party, so every one went to\r\nbed early, and when the Phoenix reported that both servants were snoring\r\nin a heartfelt and candid manner, the children got up--they had never\r\nundressed; just putting their nightgowns on over their things had been\r\nenough to deceive Eliza when she came to turn out the gas. So they were\r\nready for anything, and they stood on the carpet and said--\r\n\r\n\'I wish we were in our burglar\'s lonely cell.\' and instantly they were.\r\n\r\nI think every one had expected the cell to be the \'deepest dungeon below\r\nthe castle moat\'. I am sure no one had doubted that the burglar, chained\r\nby heavy fetters to a ring in the damp stone wall, would be tossing\r\nuneasily on a bed of straw, with a pitcher of water and a mouldering\r\ncrust, untasted, beside him. Robert, remembering the underground passage\r\nand the treasure, had brought a candle and matches, but these were not\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nThe cell was a little white-washed room about twelve feet long and\r\nsix feet wide. On one side of it was a sort of shelf sloping a little\r\ntowards the wall. On this were two rugs, striped blue and yellow, and a\r\nwater-proof pillow. Rolled in the rugs, and with his head on the pillow,\r\nlay the burglar, fast asleep. (He had had his tea, though this the\r\nchildren did not know--it had come from the coffee-shop round the\r\ncorner, in very thick crockery.) The scene was plainly revealed by the\r\nlight of a gas-lamp in the passage outside, which shone into the cell\r\nthrough a pane of thick glass over the door.\r\n\r\n\'I shall gag him,\' said Cyril, \'and Robert will hold him down. Anthea\r\nand Jane and the Phoenix can whisper soft nothings to him while he\r\ngradually awakes.\'\r\n\r\nThis plan did not have the success it deserved, because the burglar,\r\ncuriously enough, was much stronger, even in his sleep, than Robert and\r\nCyril, and at the first touch of their hands he leapt up and shouted out\r\nsomething very loud indeed.\r\n\r\nInstantly steps were heard outside. Anthea threw her arms round the\r\nburglar and whispered--\r\n\r\n\'It\'s us--the ones that gave you the cats. We\'ve come to save you, only\r\ndon\'t let on we\'re here. Can\'t we hide somewhere?\'\r\n\r\nHeavy boots sounded on the flagged passage outside, and a firm voice\r\nshouted--\r\n\r\n\'Here--you--stop that row, will you?\'\r\n\r\n\'All right, governor,\' replied the burglar, still with Anthea\'s arms\r\nround him; \'I was only a-talking in my sleep. No offence.\'\r\n\r\nIt was an awful moment. Would the boots and the voice come in. Yes! No!\r\nThe voice said--\r\n\r\n\'Well, stow it, will you?\'\r\n\r\nAnd the boots went heavily away, along the passage and up some sounding\r\nstone stairs.\r\n\r\n\'Now then,\' whispered Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'How the blue Moses did you get in?\' asked the burglar, in a hoarse\r\nwhisper of amazement.\r\n\r\n\'On the carpet,\' said Jane, truly.\r\n\r\n\'Stow that,\' said the burglar. \'One on you I could \'a\' swallowed, but\r\nfour--AND a yellow fowl.\'\r\n\r\n\'Look here,\' said Cyril, sternly, \'you wouldn\'t have believed any one if\r\nthey\'d told you beforehand about your finding a cow and all those cats\r\nin our nursery.\'\r\n\r\n\'That I wouldn\'t,\' said the burglar, with whispered fervour, \'so help me\r\nBob, I wouldn\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, then,\' Cyril went on, ignoring this appeal to his brother, \'just\r\ntry to believe what we tell you and act accordingly. It can\'t do you any\r\nHARM, you know,\' he went on in hoarse whispered earnestness. \'You can\'t\r\nbe very much worse off than you are now, you know. But if you\'ll just\r\ntrust to us we\'ll get you out of this right enough. No one saw us come\r\nin. The question is, where would you like to go?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'d like to go to Boolong,\' was the instant reply of the burglar. \'I\'ve\r\nalways wanted to go on that there trip, but I\'ve never \'ad the ready at\r\nthe right time of the year.\'\r\n\r\n\'Boolong is a town like London,\' said Cyril, well meaning, but\r\ninaccurate, \'how could you get a living there?\'\r\n\r\nThe burglar scratched his head in deep doubt.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s \'ard to get a \'onest living anywheres nowadays,\' he said, and his\r\nvoice was sad.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, isn\'t it?\' said Jane, sympathetically; \'but how about a sunny\r\nsouthern shore, where there\'s nothing to do at all unless you want to.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s my billet, miss,\' replied the burglar. \'I never did care about\r\nwork--not like some people, always fussing about.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did you never like any sort of work?\' asked Anthea, severely.\r\n\r\n\'Lor\', lumme, yes,\' he answered, \'gardening was my \'obby, so it was. But\r\nfather died afore \'e could bind me to a nurseryman, an\'--\'\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll take you to the sunny southern shore,\' said Jane; \'you\'ve no idea\r\nwhat the flowers are like.\'\r\n\r\n\'Our old cook\'s there,\' said Anthea. \'She\'s queen--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, chuck it,\' the burglar whispered, clutching at his head with both\r\nhands. \'I knowed the first minute I see them cats and that cow as it was\r\na judgement on me. I don\'t know now whether I\'m a-standing on my hat or\r\nmy boots, so help me I don\'t. If you CAN get me out, get me, and if you\r\ncan\'t, get along with you for goodness\' sake, and give me a chanst\r\nto think about what\'ll be most likely to go down with the Beak in the\r\nmorning.\'\r\n\r\n\'Come on to the carpet, then,\' said Anthea, gently shoving. The others\r\nquietly pulled, and the moment the feet of the burglar were planted on\r\nthe carpet Anthea wished:\r\n\r\n\'I wish we were all on the sunny southern shore where cook is.\'\r\n\r\nAnd instantly they were. There were the rainbow sands, the tropic\r\nglories of leaf and flower, and there, of course, was the cook, crowned\r\nwith white flowers, and with all the wrinkles of crossness and tiredness\r\nand hard work wiped out of her face.\r\n\r\n\'Why, cook, you\'re quite pretty!\' Anthea said, as soon as she had got\r\nher breath after the tumble-rush-whirl of the carpet. The burglar stood\r\nrubbing his eyes in the brilliant tropic sunlight, and gazing wildly\r\nround him on the vivid hues of the tropic land.\r\n\r\n\'Penny plain and tuppence coloured!\' he exclaimed pensively, \'and well\r\nworth any tuppence, however hard-earned.\'\r\n\r\nThe cook was seated on a grassy mound with her court of copper-coloured\r\nsavages around her. The burglar pointed a grimy finger at these.\r\n\r\n\'Are they tame?\' he asked anxiously. \'Do they bite or scratch, or do\r\nanything to yer with poisoned arrows or oyster shells or that?\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you be so timid,\' said the cook. \'Look\'e \'ere, this \'ere\'s only\r\na dream what you\'ve come into, an\' as it\'s only a dream there\'s no\r\nnonsense about what a young lady like me ought to say or not, so I\'ll\r\nsay you\'re the best-looking fellow I\'ve seen this many a day. And the\r\ndream goes on and on, seemingly, as long as you behaves. The things what\r\nyou has to eat and drink tastes just as good as real ones, and--\'\r\n\r\n\'Look \'ere,\' said the burglar, \'I\'ve come \'ere straight outer the pleece\r\nstation. These \'ere kids\'ll tell you it ain\'t no blame er mine.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you WERE a burglar, you know,\' said the truthful Anthea gently.\r\n\r\n\'Only because I was druv to it by dishonest blokes, as well you knows,\r\nmiss,\' rejoined the criminal. \'Blowed if this ain\'t the \'ottest January\r\nas I\'ve known for years.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wouldn\'t you like a bath?\' asked the queen, \'and some white clothes\r\nlike me?\'\r\n\r\n\'I should only look a juggins in \'em, miss, thanking you all the same,\'\r\nwas the reply; \'but a bath I wouldn\'t resist, and my shirt was only\r\nclean on week before last.\'\r\n\r\nCyril and Robert led him to a rocky pool, where he bathed luxuriously.\r\nThen, in shirt and trousers he sat on the sand and spoke.\r\n\r\n\'That cook, or queen, or whatever you call her--her with the white bokay\r\non her \'ed--she\'s my sort. Wonder if she\'d keep company!\'\r\n\r\n\'I should ask her.\'\r\n\r\n\'I was always a quick hitter,\' the man went on; \'it\'s a word and a blow\r\nwith me. I will.\'\r\n\r\nIn shirt and trousers, and crowned with a scented flowery wreath which\r\nCyril hastily wove as they returned to the court of the queen, the\r\nburglar stood before the cook and spoke.\r\n\r\n\'Look \'ere, miss,\' he said. \'You an\' me being\' all forlorn-like, both on\r\nus, in this \'ere dream, or whatever you calls it, I\'d like to tell you\r\nstraight as I likes yer looks.\'\r\n\r\nThe cook smiled and looked down bashfully.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m a single man--what you might call a batcheldore. I\'m mild in my\r\n\'abits, which these kids\'ll tell you the same, and I\'d like to \'ave the\r\npleasure of walkin\' out with you next Sunday.\'\r\n\r\n\'Lor!\' said the queen cook, \'\'ow sudden you are, mister.\'\r\n\r\n\'Walking out means you\'re going to be married,\' said Anthea. \'Why not\r\nget married and have done with it? _I_ would.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t mind if I do,\' said the burglar. But the cook said--\r\n\r\n\'No, miss. Not me, not even in a dream. I don\'t say anythink ag\'in the\r\nyoung chap\'s looks, but I always swore I\'d be married in church, if at\r\nall--and, anyway, I don\'t believe these here savages would know how\r\nto keep a registering office, even if I was to show them. No, mister,\r\nthanking you kindly, if you can\'t bring a clergyman into the dream I\'ll\r\nlive and die like what I am.\'\r\n\r\n\'Will you marry her if we get a clergyman?\' asked the match-making\r\nAnthea.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m agreeable, miss, I\'m sure,\' said he, pulling his wreath straight.\r\n\'\'Ow this \'ere bokay do tiddle a chap\'s ears to be sure!\'\r\n\r\nSo, very hurriedly, the carpet was spread out, and instructed to fetch\r\na clergyman. The instructions were written on the inside of Cyril\'s cap\r\nwith a piece of billiard chalk Robert had got from the marker at the\r\nhotel at Lyndhurst. The carpet disappeared, and more quickly than you\r\nwould have thought possible it came back, bearing on its bosom the\r\nReverend Septimus Blenkinsop.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Septimus was rather a nice young man, but very much mazed\r\nand muddled, because when he saw a strange carpet laid out at his feet,\r\nin his own study, he naturally walked on it to examine it more closely.\r\nAnd he happened to stand on one of the thin places that Jane and Anthea\r\nhad darned, so that he was half on wishing carpet and half on plain\r\nScotch heather-mixture fingering, which has no magic properties at all.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this was that he was only half there--so that the children\r\ncould just see through him, as though he had been a ghost. And as for\r\nhim, he saw the sunny southern shore, the cook and the burglar and the\r\nchildren quite plainly; but through them all he saw, quite plainly also,\r\nhis study at home, with the books and the pictures and the marble clock\r\nthat had been presented to him when he left his last situation.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to himself to be in a sort of insane fit, so that it did not\r\nmatter what he did--and he married the burglar to the cook. The cook\r\nsaid that she would rather have had a solider kind of a clergyman, one\r\nthat you couldn\'t see through so plain, but perhaps this was real enough\r\nfor a dream.\r\n\r\nAnd of course the clergyman, though misty, was really real, and able\r\nto marry people, and he did. When the ceremony was over the clergyman\r\nwandered about the island collecting botanical specimens, for he was a\r\ngreat botanist, and the ruling passion was strong even in an insane fit.\r\n\r\nThere was a splendid wedding feast. Can you fancy Jane and Anthea,\r\nand Robert and Cyril, dancing merrily in a ring, hand-in-hand with\r\ncopper-coloured savages, round the happy couple, the queen cook and the\r\nburglar consort? There were more flowers gathered and thrown than you\r\nhave ever even dreamed of, and before the children took carpet for home\r\nthe now married-and-settled burglar made a speech.\r\n\r\n\'Ladies and gentlemen,\' he said, \'and savages of both kinds, only I know\r\nyou can\'t understand what I\'m a saying of, but we\'ll let that pass.\r\nIf this is a dream, I\'m on. If it ain\'t, I\'m onner than ever. If it\'s\r\nbetwixt and between--well, I\'m honest, and I can\'t say more. I don\'t\r\nwant no more \'igh London society--I\'ve got some one to put my arm around\r\nof; and I\'ve got the whole lot of this \'ere island for my allotment, and\r\nif I don\'t grow some broccoli as\'ll open the judge\'s eye at the cottage\r\nflower shows, well, strike me pink! All I ask is, as these young gents\r\nand ladies\'ll bring some parsley seed into the dream, and a penn\'orth of\r\nradish seed, and threepenn\'orth of onion, and I wouldn\'t mind goin\' to\r\nfourpence or fippence for mixed kale, only I ain\'t got a brown, so I\r\ndon\'t deceive you. And there\'s one thing more, you might take away the\r\nparson. I don\'t like things what I can see \'alf through, so here\'s how!\'\r\nHe drained a coconut-shell of palm wine.\r\n\r\nIt was now past midnight--though it was tea-time on the island.\r\n\r\nWith all good wishes the children took their leave. They also collected\r\nthe clergyman and took him back to his study and his presentation clock.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix kindly carried the seeds next day to the burglar and his\r\nbride, and returned with the most satisfactory news of the happy pair.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s made a wooden spade and started on his allotment,\' it said, \'and\r\nshe is weaving him a shirt and trousers of the most radiant whiteness.\'\r\n\r\nThe police never knew how the burglar got away. In Kentish Town Police\r\nStation his escape is still spoken of with bated breath as the Persian\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nAs for the Reverend Septimus Blenkinsop, he felt that he had had a\r\nvery insane fit indeed, and he was sure it was due to over-study. So he\r\nplanned a little dissipation, and took his two maiden aunts to Paris,\r\nwhere they enjoyed a dazzling round of museums and picture galleries,\r\nand came back feeling that they had indeed seen life. He never told his\r\naunts or any one else about the marriage on the island--because no\r\none likes it to be generally known if he has had insane fits, however\r\ninteresting and unusual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. THE HOLE IN THE CARPET\r\n\r\n\r\n     Hooray! hooray! hooray!\r\n     Mother comes home to-day;\r\n     Mother comes home to-day,\r\n     Hooray! hooray! hooray!\'\r\n\r\nJane sang this simple song directly after breakfast, and the Phoenix\r\nshed crystal tears of affectionate sympathy.\r\n\r\n\'How beautiful,\' it said, \'is filial devotion!\'\r\n\r\n\'She won\'t be home till past bedtime, though,\' said Robert. \'We might\r\nhave one more carpet-day.\'\r\n\r\nHe was glad that mother was coming home--quite glad, very glad; but at\r\nthe same time that gladness was rudely contradicted by a quite strong\r\nfeeling of sorrow, because now they could not go out all day on the\r\ncarpet.\r\n\r\n\'I do wish we could go and get something nice for mother, only she\'d\r\nwant to know where we got it,\' said Anthea. \'And she\'d never, never\r\nbelieve it, the truth. People never do, somehow, if it\'s at all\r\ninteresting.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll tell you what,\' said Robert. \'Suppose we wished the carpet to take\r\nus somewhere where we could find a purse with money in it--then we could\r\nbuy her something.\'\r\n\r\n\'Suppose it took us somewhere foreign, and the purse was covered with\r\nstrange Eastern devices, embroidered in rich silks, and full of money\r\nthat wasn\'t money at all here, only foreign curiosities, then we\r\ncouldn\'t spend it, and people would bother about where we got it, and we\r\nshouldn\'t know how on earth to get out of it at all.\'\r\n\r\nCyril moved the table off the carpet as he spoke, and its leg caught\r\nin one of Anthea\'s darns and ripped away most of it, as well as a large\r\nslit in the carpet.\r\n\r\n\'Well, now you HAVE done it,\' said Robert.\r\n\r\nBut Anthea was a really first-class sister. She did not say a word\r\ntill she had got out the Scotch heather-mixture fingering wool and the\r\ndarning-needle and the thimble and the scissors, and by that time she\r\nhad been able to get the better of her natural wish to be thoroughly\r\ndisagreeable, and was able to say quite kindly--\r\n\r\n\'Never mind, Squirrel, I\'ll soon mend it.\'\r\n\r\nCyril thumped her on the back. He understood exactly how she had felt,\r\nand he was not an ungrateful brother.\r\n\r\n\'Respecting the purse containing coins,\' the Phoenix said, scratching\r\nits invisible ear thoughtfully with its shining claw, \'it might be as\r\nwell, perhaps, to state clearly the amount which you wish to find, as\r\nwell as the country where you wish to find it, and the nature of the\r\ncoins which you prefer. It would be indeed a cold moment when you should\r\nfind a purse containing but three oboloi.\'\r\n\r\n\'How much is an oboloi?\'\r\n\r\n\'An obol is about twopence halfpenny,\' the Phoenix replied.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Jane, \'and if you find a purse I suppose it is only because\r\nsome one has lost it, and you ought to take it to the policeman.\'\r\n\r\n\'The situation,\' remarked the Phoenix, \'does indeed bristle with\r\ndifficulties.\'\r\n\r\n\'What about a buried treasure,\' said Cyril, \'and every one was dead that\r\nit belonged to?\'\r\n\r\n\'Mother wouldn\'t believe THAT,\' said more than one voice.\r\n\r\n\'Suppose,\' said Robert--\'suppose we asked to be taken where we could\r\nfind a purse and give it back to the person it belonged to, and they\r\nwould give us something for finding it?\'\r\n\r\n\'We aren\'t allowed to take money from strangers. You know we aren\'t,\r\nBobs,\' said Anthea, making a knot at the end of a needleful of Scotch\r\nheather-mixture fingering wool (which is very wrong, and you must never\r\ndo it when you are darning).\r\n\r\n\'No, THAT wouldn\'t do,\' said Cyril. \'Let\'s chuck it and go to the North\r\nPole, or somewhere really interesting.\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said the girls together, \'there must be SOME way.\'\r\n\r\n\'Wait a sec,\' Anthea added. \'I\'ve got an idea coming. Don\'t speak.\'\r\n\r\nThere was a silence as she paused with the darning-needle in the air!\r\nSuddenly she spoke:\r\n\r\n\'I see. Let\'s tell the carpet to take us somewhere where we can get the\r\nmoney for mother\'s present, and--and--and get it some way that she\'ll\r\nbelieve in and not think wrong.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I must say you are learning the way to get the most out of the\r\ncarpet,\' said Cyril. He spoke more heartily and kindly than usual,\r\nbecause he remembered how Anthea had refrained from snarking him about\r\ntearing the carpet.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said the Phoenix, \'you certainly are. And you have to remember\r\nthat if you take a thing out it doesn\'t stay in.\'\r\n\r\nNo one paid any attention to this remark at the time, but afterwards\r\nevery one thought of it.\r\n\r\n\'Do hurry up, Panther,\' said Robert; and that was why Anthea did hurry\r\nup, and why the big darn in the middle of the carpet was all open and\r\nwebby like a fishing net, not tight and close like woven cloth, which is\r\nwhat a good, well-behaved darn should be.\r\n\r\nThen every one put on its outdoor things, the Phoenix fluttered on to\r\nthe mantelpiece and arranged its golden feathers in the glass, and all\r\nwas ready. Every one got on to the carpet.\r\n\r\n\'Please go slowly, dear carpet,\' Anthea began; we like to see where\r\nwe\'re going.\' And then she added the difficult wish that had been\r\ndecided on.\r\n\r\nNext moment the carpet, stiff and raftlike, was sailing over the roofs\r\nof Kentish Town.\r\n\r\n\'I wish--No, I don\'t mean that. I mean it\'s a PITY we aren\'t higher up,\'\r\nsaid Anthea, as the edge of the carpet grazed a chimney-pot.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s right. Be careful,\' said the Phoenix, in warning tones. \'If you\r\nwish when you\'re on a wishing carpet, you DO wish, and there\'s an end of\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\nSo for a short time no one spoke, and the carpet sailed on in calm\r\nmagnificence over St Pancras and King\'s Cross stations and over the\r\ncrowded streets of Clerkenwell.\r\n\r\n\'We\'re going out Greenwich way,\' said Cyril, as they crossed the streak\r\nof rough, tumbled water that was the Thames. \'We might go and have a\r\nlook at the Palace.\'\r\n\r\nOn and on the carpet swept, still keeping much nearer to the\r\nchimney-pots than the children found at all comfortable. And then, just\r\nover New Cross, a terrible thing happened.\r\n\r\nJane and Robert were in the middle of the carpet. Part of them was\r\non the carpet, and part of them--the heaviest part--was on the great\r\ncentral darn.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s all very misty,\' said Jane; \'it looks partly like out of doors\r\nand partly like in the nursery at home. I feel as if I was going to have\r\nmeasles; everything looked awfully rum then, remember.\'\r\n\r\n\'I feel just exactly the same,\' Robert said.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s the hole,\' said the Phoenix; \'it\'s not measles whatever that\r\npossession may be.\'\r\n\r\nAnd at that both Robert and Jane suddenly, and at once, made a bound to\r\ntry and get on to the safer part of the carpet, and the darn gave way\r\nand their boots went up, and the heavy heads and bodies of them went\r\ndown through the hole, and they landed in a position something between\r\nsitting and sprawling on the flat leads on the top of a high, grey,\r\ngloomy, respectable house whose address was 705, Amersham Road, New\r\nCross.\r\n\r\nThe carpet seemed to awaken to new energy as soon as it had got rid of\r\ntheir weight, and it rose high in the air. The others lay down flat and\r\npeeped over the edge of the rising carpet.\r\n\r\n\'Are you hurt?\' cried Cyril, and Robert shouted \'No,\' and next moment\r\nthe carpet had sped away, and Jane and Robert were hidden from the sight\r\nof the others by a stack of smoky chimneys.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, how awful!\' said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'It might have been worse,\' said the Phoenix. \'What would have been\r\nthe sentiments of the survivors if that darn had given way when we were\r\ncrossing the river?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, there\'s that,\' said Cyril, recovering himself. \'They\'ll be all\r\nright. They\'ll howl till some one gets them down, or drop tiles into\r\nthe front garden to attract attention of passersby. Bobs has got my\r\none-and-fivepence--lucky you forgot to mend that hole in my pocket,\r\nPanther, or he wouldn\'t have had it. They can tram it home.\'\r\n\r\nBut Anthea would not be comforted.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s all my fault,\' she said. \'I KNEW the proper way to darn, and I\r\ndidn\'t do it. It\'s all my fault. Let\'s go home and patch the carpet with\r\nyour Etons--something really strong--and send it to fetch them.\'\r\n\r\n\'All right,\' said Cyril; \'but your Sunday jacket is stronger than my\r\nEtons. We must just chuck mother\'s present, that\'s all. I wish--\'\r\n\r\n\'Stop!\' cried the Phoenix; \'the carpet is dropping to earth.\'\r\n\r\nAnd indeed it was.\r\n\r\nIt sank swiftly, yet steadily, and landed on the pavement of the\r\nDeptford Road. It tipped a little as it landed, so that Cyril and Anthea\r\nnaturally walked off it, and in an instant it had rolled itself up and\r\nhidden behind a gate-post. It did this so quickly that not a single\r\nperson in the Deptford Road noticed it. The Phoenix rustled its way into\r\nthe breast of Cyril\'s coat, and almost at the same moment a well-known\r\nvoice remarked--\r\n\r\n\'Well, I never! What on earth are you doing here?\'\r\n\r\nThey were face to face with their pet uncle--their Uncle Reginald.\r\n\r\n\'We DID think of going to Greenwich Palace and talking about Nelson,\'\r\nsaid Cyril, telling as much of the truth as he thought his uncle could\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\n\'And where are the others?\' asked Uncle Reginald.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t exactly know,\' Cyril replied, this time quite truthfully.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Uncle Reginald, \'I must fly. I\'ve a case in the County\r\nCourt. That\'s the worst of being a beastly solicitor. One can\'t take the\r\nchances of life when one gets them. If only I could come with you to the\r\nPainted Hall and give you lunch at the "Ship" afterwards! But, alas! it\r\nmay not be.\'\r\n\r\nThe uncle felt in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\'_I_ mustn\'t enjoy myself,\' he said, \'but that\'s no reason why you\r\nshouldn\'t. Here, divide this by four, and the product ought to give you\r\nsome desired result. Take care of yourselves. Adieu.\'\r\n\r\nAnd waving a cheery farewell with his neat umbrella, the good and\r\nhigh-hatted uncle passed away, leaving Cyril and Anthea to exchange\r\neloquent glances over the shining golden sovereign that lay in Cyril\'s\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\'Well!\' said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'Well!\' said Cyril.\r\n\r\n\'Well!\' said the Phoenix.\r\n\r\n\'Good old carpet!\' said Cyril, joyously.\r\n\r\n\'It WAS clever of it--so adequate and yet so simple,\' said the Phoenix,\r\nwith calm approval.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, come on home and let\'s mend the carpet. I am a beast. I\'d forgotten\r\nthe others just for a minute,\' said the conscience-stricken Anthea.\r\n\r\nThey unrolled the carpet quickly and slyly--they did not want to attract\r\npublic attention--and the moment their feet were on the carpet Anthea\r\nwished to be at home, and instantly they were.\r\n\r\nThe kindness of their excellent uncle had made it unnecessary for them\r\nto go to such extremes as Cyril\'s Etons or Anthea\'s Sunday jacket for\r\nthe patching of the carpet.\r\n\r\nAnthea set to work at once to draw the edges of the broken darn\r\ntogether, and Cyril hastily went out and bought a large piece of the\r\nmarble-patterned American oil-cloth which careful house-wives use to\r\ncover dressers and kitchen tables. It was the strongest thing he could\r\nthink of.\r\n\r\nThen they set to work to line the carpet throughout with the oil-cloth.\r\nThe nursery felt very odd and empty without the others, and Cyril did\r\nnot feel so sure as he had done about their being able to \'tram it\'\r\nhome. So he tried to help Anthea, which was very good of him, but not\r\nmuch use to her.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix watched them for a time, but it was plainly growing more and\r\nmore restless. It fluffed up its splendid feathers, and stood first on\r\none gilded claw and then on the other, and at last it said--\r\n\r\n\'I can bear it no longer. This suspense! My Robert--who set my egg to\r\nhatch--in the bosom of whose Norfolk raiment I have nestled so often and\r\nso pleasantly! I think, if you\'ll excuse me--\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes--DO,\' cried Anthea, \'I wish we\'d thought of asking you before.\'\r\n\r\nCyril opened the window. The Phoenix flapped its sunbright wings and\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\n\'So THAT\'S all right,\' said Cyril, taking up his needle and instantly\r\npricking his hand in a new place.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course I know that what you have really wanted to know about all this\r\ntime is not what Anthea and Cyril did, but what happened to Jane and\r\nRobert after they fell through the carpet on to the leads of the house\r\nwhich was called number 705, Amersham Road.\r\n\r\nBut I had to tell you the other first. That is one of the most annoying\r\nthings about stories, you cannot tell all the different parts of them at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\nRobert\'s first remark when he found himself seated on the damp, cold,\r\nsooty leads was--\r\n\r\n\'Here\'s a go!\'\r\n\r\nJane\'s first act was tears.\r\n\r\n\'Dry up, Pussy; don\'t be a little duffer,\' said her brother, kindly,\r\n\'it\'ll be all right.\'\r\n\r\nAnd then he looked about, just as Cyril had known he would, for\r\nsomething to throw down, so as to attract the attention of the wayfarers\r\nfar below in the street. He could not find anything. Curiously enough,\r\nthere were no stones on the leads, not even a loose tile. The roof was\r\nof slate, and every single slate knew its place and kept it. But, as so\r\noften happens, in looking for one thing he found another. There was a\r\ntrap-door leading down into the house.\r\n\r\nAnd that trap-door was not fastened.\r\n\r\n\'Stop snivelling and come here, Jane,\' he cried, encouragingly. \'Lend a\r\nhand to heave this up. If we can get into the house, we might sneak down\r\nwithout meeting any one, with luck. Come on.\'\r\n\r\nThey heaved up the door till it stood straight up, and, as they bent to\r\nlook into the hole below, the door fell back with a hollow clang on the\r\nleads behind, and with its noise was mingled a blood-curdling scream\r\nfrom underneath.\r\n\r\n\'Discovered!\' hissed Robert. \'Oh, my cats alive!\'\r\n\r\nThey were indeed discovered.\r\n\r\nThey found themselves looking down into an attic, which was also\r\na lumber-room. It had boxes and broken chairs, old fenders and\r\npicture-frames, and rag-bags hanging from nails.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the floor was a box, open, half full of clothes. Other\r\nclothes lay on the floor in neat piles. In the middle of the piles of\r\nclothes sat a lady, very fat indeed, with her feet sticking out straight\r\nin front of her. And it was she who had screamed, and who, in fact, was\r\nstill screaming.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t!\' cried Jane, \'please don\'t! We won\'t hurt you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Where are the rest of your gang?\' asked the lady, stopping short in the\r\nmiddle of a scream.\r\n\r\n\'The others have gone on, on the wishing carpet,\' said Jane truthfully.\r\n\r\n\'The wishing carpet?\' said the lady.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Jane, before Robert could say \'You shut up!\' \'You must have\r\nread about it. The Phoenix is with them.\'\r\n\r\nThen the lady got up, and picking her way carefully between the piles of\r\nclothes she got to the door and through it. She shut it behind her, and\r\nthe two children could hear her calling \'Septimus! Septimus!\' in a loud\r\nyet frightened way.\r\n\r\n\'Now,\' said Robert quickly; \'I\'ll drop first.\'\r\n\r\nHe hung by his hands and dropped through the trap-door.\r\n\r\n\'Now you. Hang by your hands. I\'ll catch you. Oh, there\'s no time for\r\njaw. Drop, I say.\'\r\n\r\nJane dropped.\r\n\r\nRobert tried to catch her, and even before they had finished the\r\nbreathless roll among the piles of clothes, which was what his catching\r\nended in, he whispered--\r\n\r\n\'We\'ll hide--behind those fenders and things; they\'ll think we\'ve gone\r\nalong the roofs. Then, when all is calm, we\'ll creep down the stairs and\r\ntake our chance.\'\r\n\r\nThey hastily hid. A corner of an iron bedstead stuck into Robert\'s side,\r\nand Jane had only standing room for one foot--but they bore it--and when\r\nthe lady came back, not with Septimus, but with another lady, they held\r\ntheir breath and their hearts beat thickly.\r\n\r\n\'Gone!\' said the first lady; \'poor little things--quite mad, my\r\ndear--and at large! We must lock this room and send for the police.\'\r\n\r\n\'Let me look out,\' said the second lady, who was, if possible, older\r\nand thinner and primmer than the first. So the two ladies dragged a box\r\nunder the trap-door and put another box on the top of it, and then they\r\nboth climbed up very carefully and put their two trim, tidy heads out of\r\nthe trap-door to look for the \'mad children\'.\r\n\r\n\'Now,\' whispered Robert, getting the bedstead leg out of his side.\r\n\r\nThey managed to creep out from their hiding-place and out through the\r\ndoor before the two ladies had done looking out of the trap-door on to\r\nthe empty leads.\r\n\r\nRobert and Jane tiptoed down the stairs--one flight, two flights. Then\r\nthey looked over the banisters. Horror! a servant was coming up with a\r\nloaded scuttle.\r\n\r\nThe children with one consent crept swiftly through the first open door.\r\n\r\nThe room was a study, calm and gentlemanly, with rows of books, a\r\nwriting table, and a pair of embroidered slippers warming themselves in\r\nthe fender. The children hid behind the window-curtains. As they passed\r\nthe table they saw on it a missionary-box with its bottom label torn\r\noff, open and empty.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, how awful!\' whispered Jane. \'We shall never get away alive.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hush!\' said Robert, not a moment too soon, for there were steps on the\r\nstairs, and next instant the two ladies came into the room. They did not\r\nsee the children, but they saw the empty missionary box.\r\n\r\n\'I knew it,\' said one. \'Selina, it WAS a gang. I was certain of it from\r\nthe first. The children were not mad. They were sent to distract our\r\nattention while their confederates robbed the house.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am afraid you are right,\' said Selina; \'and WHERE ARE THEY NOW?\'\r\n\r\n\'Downstairs, no doubt, collecting the silver milk-jug and sugar-basin\r\nand the punch-ladle that was Uncle Joe\'s, and Aunt Jerusha\'s teaspoons.\r\nI shall go down.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, don\'t be so rash and heroic,\' said Selina. \'Amelia, we must call\r\nthe police from the window. Lock the door. I WILL--I will--\'\r\n\r\nThe words ended in a yell as Selina, rushing to the window, came face to\r\nface with the hidden children.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, don\'t!\' said Jane; \'how can you be so unkind? We AREN\'T burglars,\r\nand we haven\'t any gang, and we didn\'t open your missionary-box.\r\nWe opened our own once, but we didn\'t have to use the money, so our\r\nconsciences made us put it back and--DON\'T! Oh, I wish you wouldn\'t--\'\r\n\r\nMiss Selina had seized Jane and Miss Amelia captured Robert. The\r\nchildren found themselves held fast by strong, slim hands, pink at the\r\nwrists and white at the knuckles.\r\n\r\n\'We\'ve got YOU, at any rate,\' said Miss Amelia. \'Selina, your captive\r\nis smaller than mine. You open the window at once and call "Murder!" as\r\nloud as you can.\r\n\r\nSelina obeyed; but when she had opened the window, instead of calling\r\n\'Murder!\' she called \'Septimus!\' because at that very moment she saw her\r\nnephew coming in at the gate.\r\n\r\nIn another minute he had let himself in with his latch-key and had\r\nmounted the stairs. As he came into the room Jane and Robert each\r\nuttered a shriek of joy so loud and so sudden that the ladies leaped\r\nwith surprise, and nearly let them go.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s our own clergyman,\' cried Jane.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you remember us?\' asked Robert. \'You married our burglar for\r\nus--don\'t you remember?\'\r\n\r\n\'I KNEW it was a gang,\' said Amelia. \'Septimus, these abandoned children\r\nare members of a desperate burgling gang who are robbing the house. They\r\nhave already forced the missionary-box and purloined its contents.\'\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Septimus passed his hand wearily over his brow.\r\n\r\n\'I feel a little faint,\' he said, \'running upstairs so quickly.\'\r\n\r\n\'We never touched the beastly box,\' said Robert.\r\n\r\n\'Then your confederates did,\' said Miss Selina.\r\n\r\n\'No, no,\' said the curate, hastily. \'_I_ opened the box myself.\r\nThis morning I found I had not enough small change for the Mothers\'\r\nIndependent Unity Measles and Croup Insurance payments. I suppose this\r\nis NOT a dream, is it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Dream? No, indeed. Search the house. I insist upon it.\'\r\n\r\nThe curate, still pale and trembling, searched the house, which, of\r\ncourse, was blamelessly free of burglars.\r\n\r\nWhen he came back he sank wearily into his chair.\r\n\r\n\'Aren\'t you going to let us go?\' asked Robert, with furious indignation,\r\nfor there is something in being held by a strong lady that sets the\r\nblood of a boy boiling in his veins with anger and despair. \'We\'ve never\r\ndone anything to you. It\'s all the carpet. It dropped us on the leads.\r\nWE couldn\'t help it. You know how it carried you over to the island, and\r\nyou had to marry the burglar to the cook.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, my head!\' said the curate.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind your head just now,\' said Robert; \'try to be honest and\r\nhonourable, and do your duty in that state of life!\'\r\n\r\n\'This is a judgement on me for something, I suppose,\' said the Reverend\r\nSeptimus, wearily, \'but I really cannot at the moment remember what.\'\r\n\r\n\'Send for the police,\' said Miss Selina.\r\n\r\n\'Send for a doctor,\' said the curate.\r\n\r\n\'Do you think they ARE mad, then,\' said Miss Amelia.\r\n\r\n\'I think I am,\' said the curate.\r\n\r\nJane had been crying ever since her capture. Now she said-- \'You aren\'t\r\nnow, but perhaps you will be, if--And it would serve you jolly well\r\nright, too.\'\r\n\r\n\'Aunt Selina,\' said the curate, \'and Aunt Amelia, believe me, this is\r\nonly an insane dream. You will realize it soon. It has happened to me\r\nbefore. But do not let us be unjust, even in a dream. Do not hold the\r\nchildren; they have done no harm. As I said before, it was I who opened\r\nthe box.\'\r\n\r\nThe strong, bony hands unwillingly loosened their grasp. Robert shook\r\nhimself and stood in sulky resentment. But Jane ran to the curate and\r\nembraced him so suddenly that he had not time to defend himself.\r\n\r\n\'You\'re a dear,\' she said. \'It IS like a dream just at first, but you\r\nget used to it. Now DO let us go. There\'s a good, kind, honourable\r\nclergyman.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know,\' said the Reverend Septimus; \'it\'s a difficult problem.\r\nIt is such a very unusual dream. Perhaps it\'s only a sort of other\r\nlife--quite real enough for you to be mad in. And if you\'re mad, there\r\nmight be a dream-asylum where you\'d be kindly treated, and in time\r\nrestored, cured, to your sorrowing relatives. It is very hard to see\r\nyour duty plainly, even in ordinary life, and these dream-circumstances\r\nare so complicated--\'\r\n\r\n\'If it\'s a dream,\' said Robert, \'you will wake up directly, and then\r\nyou\'d be sorry if you\'d sent us into a dream-asylum, because you might\r\nnever get into the same dream again and let us out, and so we might stay\r\nthere for ever, and then what about our sorrowing relatives who aren\'t\r\nin the dreams at all?\'\r\n\r\nBut all the curate could now say was, \'Oh, my head!\'\r\n\r\nAnd Jane and Robert felt quite ill with helplessness and hopelessness. A\r\nreally conscientious curate is a very difficult thing to manage.\r\n\r\nAnd then, just as the hopelessness and the helplessness were getting to\r\nbe almost more than they could bear, the two children suddenly felt that\r\nextraordinary shrinking feeling that you always have when you are just\r\ngoing to vanish. And the next moment they had vanished, and the Reverend\r\nSeptimus was left alone with his aunts.\r\n\r\n\'I knew it was a dream,\' he cried, wildly. \'I\'ve had something like\r\nit before. Did you dream it too, Aunt Selina, and you, Aunt Amelia? I\r\ndreamed that you did, you know.\'\r\n\r\nAunt Selina looked at him and then at Aunt Amelia. Then she said\r\nboldly--\r\n\r\n\'What do you mean? WE haven\'t been dreaming anything. You must have\r\ndropped off in your chair.\'\r\n\r\nThe curate heaved a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, if it\'s only _I_,\' he said; \'if we\'d all dreamed it I could never\r\nhave believed it, never!\'\r\n\r\nAfterwards Aunt Selina said to the other aunt--\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I know it was an untruth, and I shall doubtless be punished for it\r\nin due course. But I could see the poor dear fellow\'s brain giving way\r\nbefore my very eyes. He couldn\'t have stood the strain of three dreams.\r\nIt WAS odd, wasn\'t it? All three of us dreaming the same thing at the\r\nsame moment. We must never tell dear Seppy. But I shall send an account\r\nof it to the Psychical Society, with stars instead of names, you know.\'\r\n\r\nAnd she did. And you can read all about it in one of the society\'s fat\r\nBlue-books.\r\n\r\nOf course, you understand what had happened? The intelligent Phoenix had\r\nsimply gone straight off to the Psammead, and had wished Robert and Jane\r\nat home. And, of course, they were at home at once. Cyril and Anthea had\r\nnot half finished mending the carpet.\r\n\r\nWhen the joyful emotions of reunion had calmed down a little, they\r\nall went out and spent what was left of Uncle Reginald\'s sovereign in\r\npresents for mother. They bought her a pink silk handkerchief, a pair of\r\nblue and white vases, a bottle of scent, a packet of Christmas candles,\r\nand a cake of soap shaped and coloured like a tomato, and one that was\r\nso like an orange that almost any one you had given it to would have\r\ntried to peel it--if they liked oranges, of course. Also they bought a\r\ncake with icing on, and the rest of the money they spent on flowers to\r\nput in the vases.\r\n\r\nWhen they had arranged all the things on a table, with the candles stuck\r\nup on a plate ready to light the moment mother\'s cab was heard, they\r\nwashed themselves thoroughly and put on tidier clothes.\r\n\r\nThen Robert said, \'Good old Psammead,\' and the others said so too.\r\n\r\n\'But, really, it\'s just as much good old Phoenix,\' said Robert. \'Suppose\r\nit hadn\'t thought of getting the wish!\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!\' said the Phoenix, \'it is perhaps fortunate for you that I am such\r\na competent bird.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s mother\'s cab,\' cried Anthea, and the Phoenix hid and they\r\nlighted the candles, and next moment mother was home again.\r\n\r\nShe liked her presents very much, and found their story of Uncle\r\nReginald and the sovereign easy and even pleasant to believe.\r\n\r\n\'Good old carpet,\' were Cyril\'s last sleepy words.\r\n\r\n\'What there is of it,\' said the Phoenix, from the cornice-pole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. THE BEGINNING OF THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Well, I MUST say,\' mother said, looking at the wishing carpet as it\r\nlay, all darned and mended and backed with shiny American cloth, on the\r\nfloor of the nursery--\'I MUST say I\'ve never in my life bought such a\r\nbad bargain as that carpet.\'\r\n\r\nA soft \'Oh!\' of contradiction sprang to the lips of Cyril, Robert, Jane,\r\nand Anthea. Mother looked at them quickly, and said--\r\n\r\n\'Well, of course, I see you\'ve mended it very nicely, and that was sweet\r\nof you, dears.\'\r\n\r\n\'The boys helped too,\' said the dears, honourably.\r\n\r\n\'But, still--twenty-two and ninepence! It ought to have lasted for\r\nyears. It\'s simply dreadful now. Well, never mind, darlings, you\'ve\r\ndone your best. I think we\'ll have coconut matting next time. A carpet\r\ndoesn\'t have an easy life of it in this room, does it?\'\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not our fault, mother, is it, that our boots are the really\r\nreliable kind?\' Robert asked the question more in sorrow than in anger.\r\n\r\n\'No, dear, we can\'t help our boots,\' said mother, cheerfully, \'but we\r\nmight change them when we come in, perhaps. It\'s just an idea of mine.\r\nI wouldn\'t dream of scolding on the very first morning after I\'ve come\r\nhome. Oh, my Lamb, how could you?\'\r\n\r\nThis conversation was at breakfast, and the Lamb had been beautifully\r\ngood until every one was looking at the carpet, and then it was for him\r\nbut the work of a moment to turn a glass dish of syrupy blackberry jam\r\nupside down on his young head. It was the work of a good many minutes\r\nand several persons to get the jam off him again, and this interesting\r\nwork took people\'s minds off the carpet, and nothing more was said just\r\nthen about its badness as a bargain and about what mother hoped for from\r\ncoconut matting.\r\n\r\nWhen the Lamb was clean again he had to be taken care of while mother\r\nrumpled her hair and inked her fingers and made her head ache over the\r\ndifficult and twisted house-keeping accounts which cook gave her on\r\ndirty bits of paper, and which were supposed to explain how it was that\r\ncook had only fivepence-half-penny and a lot of unpaid bills left out\r\nof all the money mother had sent her for house-keeping. Mother was very\r\nclever, but even she could not quite understand the cook\'s accounts.\r\n\r\nThe Lamb was very glad to have his brothers and sisters to play with\r\nhim. He had not forgotten them a bit, and he made them play all the old\r\nexhausting games: \'Whirling Worlds\', where you swing the baby round and\r\nround by his hands; and \'Leg and Wing\', where you swing him from side\r\nto side by one ankle and one wrist. There was also climbing Vesuvius.\r\nIn this game the baby walks up you, and when he is standing on your\r\nshoulders, you shout as loud as you can, which is the rumbling of the\r\nburning mountain, and then tumble him gently on to the floor, and roll\r\nhim there, which is the destruction of Pompeii.\r\n\r\n\'All the same, I wish we could decide what we\'d better say next time\r\nmother says anything about the carpet,\' said Cyril, breathlessly ceasing\r\nto be a burning mountain.\r\n\r\n\'Well, you talk and decide,\' said Anthea; \'here, you lovely ducky Lamb.\r\nCome to Panther and play Noah\'s Ark.\'\r\n\r\nThe Lamb came with his pretty hair all tumbled and his face all dusty\r\nfrom the destruction of Pompeii, and instantly became a baby snake,\r\nhissing and wriggling and creeping in Anthea\'s arms, as she said--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \'I love my little baby snake,\r\n     He hisses when he is awake,\r\n     He creeps with such a wriggly creep,\r\n     He wriggles even in his sleep.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Crocky,\' said the Lamb, and showed all his little teeth. So Anthea went\r\non--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \'I love my little crocodile,\r\n     I love his truthful toothful smile;\r\n     It is so wonderful and wide,\r\n     I like to see it--FROM OUTSIDE.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Well, you see,\' Cyril was saying; \'it\'s just the old bother. Mother\r\ncan\'t believe the real true truth about the carpet, and--\'\r\n\r\n\'You speak sooth, O Cyril,\' remarked the Phoenix, coming out from the\r\ncupboard where the blackbeetles lived, and the torn books, and the\r\nbroken slates, and odd pieces of toys that had lost the rest of\r\nthemselves. \'Now hear the wisdom of Phoenix, the son of the Phoenix--\'\r\n\r\n\'There is a society called that,\' said Cyril.\r\n\r\n\'Where is it? And what is a society?\' asked the bird.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s a sort of joined-together lot of people--a sort of brotherhood--a\r\nkind of--well, something very like your temple, you know, only quite\r\ndifferent.\'\r\n\r\n\'I take your meaning,\' said the Phoenix. \'I would fain see these calling\r\nthemselves Sons of the Phoenix.\'\r\n\r\n\'But what about your words of wisdom?\'\r\n\r\n\'Wisdom is always welcome,\' said the Phoenix.\r\n\r\n\'Pretty Polly!\' remarked the Lamb, reaching his hands towards the golden\r\nspeaker.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix modestly retreated behind Robert, and Anthea hastened to\r\ndistract the attention of the Lamb by murmuring--\r\n\r\n\r\n     "I love my little baby rabbit;\r\n     But oh! he has a dreadful habit\r\n     Of paddling out among the rocks\r\n     And soaking both his bunny socks.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think you\'d care about the sons of the Phoenix, really,\' said\r\nRobert. \'I have heard that they don\'t do anything fiery. They only drink\r\na great deal. Much more than other people, because they drink lemonade\r\nand fizzy things, and the more you drink of those the more good you\r\nget.\'\r\n\r\n\'In your mind, perhaps,\' said Jane; \'but it wouldn\'t be good in your\r\nbody. You\'d get too balloony.\'\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix yawned.\r\n\r\n\'Look here,\' said Anthea; \'I really have an idea. This isn\'t like a\r\ncommon carpet. It\'s very magic indeed. Don\'t you think, if we put Tatcho\r\non it, and then gave it a rest, the magic part of it might grow, like\r\nhair is supposed to do?\'\r\n\r\n\'It might,\' said Robert; \'but I should think paraffin would do as\r\nwell--at any rate as far as the smell goes, and that seems to be the\r\ngreat thing about Tatcho.\'\r\n\r\nBut with all its faults Anthea\'s idea was something to do, and they did\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt was Cyril who fetched the Tatcho bottle from father\'s washhand-stand.\r\nBut the bottle had not much in it.\r\n\r\n\'We mustn\'t take it all,\' Jane said, \'in case father\'s hair began to\r\ncome off suddenly. If he hadn\'t anything to put on it, it might all\r\ndrop off before Eliza had time to get round to the chemist\'s for another\r\nbottle. It would be dreadful to have a bald father, and it would all be\r\nour fault.\'\r\n\r\n\'And wigs are very expensive, I believe,\' said Anthea. \'Look here, leave\r\nenough in the bottle to wet father\'s head all over with in case any\r\nemergency emerges--and let\'s make up with paraffin. I expect it\'s the\r\nsmell that does the good really--and the smell\'s exactly the same.\'\r\n\r\nSo a small teaspoonful of the Tatcho was put on the edges of the worst\r\ndarn in the carpet and rubbed carefully into the roots of the hairs of\r\nit, and all the parts that there was not enough Tatcho for had paraffin\r\nrubbed into them with a piece of flannel. Then the flannel was burned.\r\nIt made a gay flame, which delighted the Phoenix and the Lamb.\r\n\r\n\'How often,\' said mother, opening the door--\'how often am I to tell you\r\nthat you are NOT to play with paraffin? What have you been doing?\'\r\n\r\n\'We have burnt a paraffiny rag,\' Anthea answered.\r\n\r\nIt was no use telling mother what they had done to the carpet. She did\r\nnot know it was a magic carpet, and no one wants to be laughed at for\r\ntrying to mend an ordinary carpet with lamp-oil.\r\n\r\n\'Well, don\'t do it again,\' said mother. \'And now, away with melancholy!\r\nFather has sent a telegram. Look!\' She held it out, and the children,\r\nholding it by its yielding corners, read--\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Box for kiddies at Garrick. Stalls for us, Haymarket. Meet Charing\r\nCross, 6.30.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\'That means,\' said mother, \'that you\'re going to see "The Water Babies"\r\nall by your happy selves, and father and I will take you and fetch you.\r\nGive me the Lamb, dear, and you and Jane put clean lace in your red\r\nevening frocks, and I shouldn\'t wonder if you found they wanted ironing.\r\nThis paraffin smell is ghastly. Run and get out your frocks.\'\r\n\r\nThe frocks did want ironing--wanted it rather badly, as it happened;\r\nfor, being of tomato-Coloured Liberty silk, they had been found very\r\nuseful for tableaux vivants when a red dress was required for Cardinal\r\nRichelieu. They were very nice tableaux, these, and I wish I could tell\r\nyou about them; but one cannot tell everything in a story. You would\r\nhave been specially interested in hearing about the tableau of the\r\nPrinces in the Tower, when one of the pillows burst, and the youthful\r\nPrinces were so covered with feathers that the picture might very well\r\nhave been called \'Michaelmas Eve; or, Plucking the Geese\'.\r\n\r\nIroning the dresses and sewing the lace in occupied some time, and no\r\none was dull, because there was the theatre to look forward to, and also\r\nthe possible growth of hairs on the carpet, for which every one kept\r\nlooking anxiously. By four o\'clock Jane was almost sure that several\r\nhairs were beginning to grow.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix perched on the fender, and its conversation, as usual, was\r\nentertaining and instructive--like school prizes are said to be. But it\r\nseemed a little absent-minded, and even a little sad.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t you feel well, Phoenix, dear?\' asked Anthea, stooping to take an\r\niron off the fire.\r\n\r\n\'I am not sick,\' replied the golden bird, with a gloomy shake of the\r\nhead; \'but I am getting old.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, you\'ve hardly been hatched any time at all.\'\r\n\r\n\'Time,\' remarked the Phoenix, \'is measured by heartbeats. I\'m sure the\r\npalpitations I\'ve had since I\'ve known you are enough to blanch the\r\nfeathers of any bird.\'\r\n\r\n\'But I thought you lived 500 years,\' said Robert, and you\'ve hardly\r\nbegun this set of years. Think of all the time that\'s before you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Time,\' said the Phoenix, \'is, as you are probably aware, merely a\r\nconvenient fiction. There is no such thing as time. I have lived in\r\nthese two months at a pace which generously counterbalances 500 years of\r\nlife in the desert. I am old, I am weary. I feel as if I ought to lay my\r\negg, and lay me down to my fiery sleep. But unless I\'m careful I shall\r\nbe hatched again instantly, and that is a misfortune which I really\r\ndo not think I COULD endure. But do not let me intrude these desperate\r\npersonal reflections on your youthful happiness. What is the show at the\r\ntheatre to-night? Wrestlers? Gladiators? A combat of cameleopards and\r\nunicorns?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think so,\' said Cyril; \'it\'s called "The Water Babies", and\r\nif it\'s like the book there isn\'t any gladiating in it. There are\r\nchimney-sweeps and professors, and a lobster and an otter and a salmon,\r\nand children living in the water.\'\r\n\r\n\'It sounds chilly.\' The Phoenix shivered, and went to sit on the tongs.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t suppose there will be REAL water,\' said Jane. \'And theatres are\r\nvery warm and pretty, with a lot of gold and lamps. Wouldn\'t you like to\r\ncome with us?\'\r\n\r\n\'_I_ was just going to say that,\' said Robert, in injured tones, \'only\r\nI know how rude it is to interrupt. Do come, Phoenix, old chap; it will\r\ncheer you up. It\'ll make you laugh like any thing. Mr Bourchier always\r\nmakes ripping plays. You ought to have seen "Shock-headed Peter" last\r\nyear.\'\r\n\r\n\'Your words are strange,\' said the Phoenix, \'but I will come with you.\r\nThe revels of this Bourchier, of whom you speak, may help me to forget\r\nthe weight of my years.\' So that evening the Phoenix snugged inside the\r\nwaistcoat of Robert\'s Etons--a very tight fit it seemed both to Robert\r\nand to the Phoenix--and was taken to the play.\r\n\r\nRobert had to pretend to be cold at the glittering, many-mirrored\r\nrestaurant where they ate dinner, with father in evening dress, with\r\na very shiny white shirt-front, and mother looking lovely in her grey\r\nevening dress, that changes into pink and green when she moves. Robert\r\npretended that he was too cold to take off his great-coat, and so sat\r\nsweltering through what would otherwise have been a most thrilling meal.\r\nHe felt that he was a blot on the smart beauty of the family, and he\r\nhoped the Phoenix knew what he was suffering for its sake. Of course,\r\nwe are all pleased to suffer for the sake of others, but we like them\r\nto know it unless we are the very best and noblest kind of people, and\r\nRobert was just ordinary.\r\n\r\nFather was full of jokes and fun, and every one laughed all the time,\r\neven with their mouths full, which is not manners. Robert thought father\r\nwould not have been quite so funny about his keeping his over-coat on if\r\nfather had known all the truth. And there Robert was probably right.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was finished to the last grape and the last paddle in the\r\nfinger glasses--for it was a really truly grown-up dinner--the children\r\nwere taken to the theatre, guided to a box close to the stage, and left.\r\n\r\nFather\'s parting words were: \'Now, don\'t you stir out of this box,\r\nwhatever you do. I shall be back before the end of the play. Be good\r\nand you will be happy. Is this zone torrid enough for the abandonment of\r\ngreat-coats, Bobs? No? Well, then, I should say you were sickening for\r\nsomething--mumps or measles or thrush or teething. Goodbye.\'\r\n\r\nHe went, and Robert was at last able to remove his coat, mop his\r\nperspiring brow, and release the crushed and dishevelled Phoenix. Robert\r\nhad to arrange his damp hair at the looking-glass at the back of the\r\nbox, and the Phoenix had to preen its disordered feathers for some time\r\nbefore either of them was fit to be seen.\r\n\r\nThey were very, very early. When the lights went up fully, the Phoenix,\r\nbalancing itself on the gilded back of a chair, swayed in ecstasy.\r\n\r\n\'How fair a scene is this!\' it murmured; \'how far fairer than my temple!\r\nOr have I guessed aright? Have you brought me hither to lift up my heart\r\nwith emotions of joyous surprise? Tell me, my Robert, is it not that\r\nthis, THIS is my true temple, and the other was but a humble shrine\r\nfrequented by outcasts?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know about outcasts,\' said Robert, \'but you can call this your\r\ntemple if you like. Hush! the music is beginning.\'\r\n\r\nI am not going to tell you about the play. As I said before, one can\'t\r\ntell everything, and no doubt you saw \'The Water Babies\' yourselves. If\r\nyou did not it was a shame, or, rather, a pity.\r\n\r\nWhat I must tell you is that, though Cyril and Jane and Robert and\r\nAnthea enjoyed it as much as any children possibly could, the pleasure\r\nof the Phoenix was far, far greater than theirs.\r\n\r\n\'This is indeed my temple,\' it said again and again. \'What radiant\r\nrites! And all to do honour to me!\'\r\n\r\nThe songs in the play it took to be hymns in its honour. The choruses\r\nwere choric songs in its praise. The electric lights, it said, were\r\nmagic torches lighted for its sake, and it was so charmed with the\r\nfootlights that the children could hardly persuade it to sit still. But\r\nwhen the limelight was shown it could contain its approval no longer. It\r\nflapped its golden wings, and cried in a voice that could be heard all\r\nover the theatre:\r\n\r\n\'Well done, my servants! Ye have my favour and my countenance!\'\r\n\r\nLittle Tom on the stage stopped short in what he was saying. A deep\r\nbreath was drawn by hundreds of lungs, every eye in the house turned to\r\nthe box where the luckless children cringed, and most people hissed, or\r\nsaid \'Shish!\' or \'Turn them out!\'\r\n\r\nThen the play went on, and an attendant presently came to the box and\r\nspoke wrathfully.\r\n\r\n\'It wasn\'t us, indeed it wasn\'t,\' said Anthea, earnestly; \'it was the\r\nbird.\'\r\n\r\nThe man said well, then, they must keep their bird very quiet.\r\n\'Disturbing every one like this,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'It won\'t do it again,\' said Robert, glancing imploringly at the golden\r\nbird; \'I\'m sure it won\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'You have my leave to depart,\' said the Phoenix gently.\r\n\r\n\'Well, he is a beauty, and no mistake,\' said the attendant, \'only I\'d\r\ncover him up during the acts. It upsets the performance.\'\r\n\r\nAnd he went.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t speak again, there\'s a dear,\' said Anthea; \'you wouldn\'t like to\r\ninterfere with your own temple, would you?\'\r\n\r\nSo now the Phoenix was quiet, but it kept whispering to the children. It\r\nwanted to know why there was no altar, no fire, no incense, and became\r\nso excited and fretful and tiresome that four at least of the party of\r\nfive wished deeply that it had been left at home.\r\n\r\nWhat happened next was entirely the fault of the Phoenix. It was not\r\nin the least the fault of the theatre people, and no one could ever\r\nunderstand afterwards how it did happen. No one, that is, except the\r\nguilty bird itself and the four children. The Phoenix was balancing\r\nitself on the gilt back of the chair, swaying backwards and forwards and\r\nup and down, as you may see your own domestic parrot do. I mean the grey\r\none with the red tail. All eyes were on the stage, where the lobster\r\nwas delighting the audience with that gem of a song, \'If you can\'t walk\r\nstraight, walk sideways!\' when the Phoenix murmured warmly--\r\n\r\n\'No altar, no fire, no incense!\' and then, before any of the children\r\ncould even begin to think of stopping it, it spread its bright wings and\r\nswept round the theatre, brushing its gleaming feathers against delicate\r\nhangings and gilded woodwork.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to have made but one circular wing-sweep, such as you may see\r\na gull make over grey water on a stormy day. Next moment it was perched\r\nagain on the chair-back--and all round the theatre, where it had passed,\r\nlittle sparks shone like tinsel seeds, then little smoke wreaths curled\r\nup like growing plants--little flames opened like flower-buds. People\r\nwhispered--then people shrieked.\r\n\r\n\'Fire! Fire!\' The curtain went down--the lights went up.\r\n\r\n\'Fire!\' cried every one, and made for the doors.\r\n\r\n\'A magnificent idea!\' said the Phoenix, complacently. \'An enormous\r\naltar--fire supplied free of charge. Doesn\'t the incense smell\r\ndelicious?\'\r\n\r\nThe only smell was the stifling smell of smoke, of burning silk, or\r\nscorching varnish.\r\n\r\nThe little flames had opened now into great flame-flowers. The people in\r\nthe theatre were shouting and pressing towards the doors.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, how COULD you!\' cried Jane. \'Let\'s get out.\'\r\n\r\n\'Father said stay here,\' said Anthea, very pale, and trying to speak in\r\nher ordinary voice.\r\n\r\n\'He didn\'t mean stay and be roasted,\' said Robert. \'No boys on burning\r\ndecks for me, thank you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not much,\' said Cyril, and he opened the door of the box.\r\n\r\nBut a fierce waft of smoke and hot air made him shut it again. It was\r\nnot possible to get out that way.\r\n\r\nThey looked over the front of the box. Could they climb down?\r\n\r\nIt would be possible, certainly; but would they be much better off?\r\n\r\n\'Look at the people,\' moaned Anthea; \'we couldn\'t get through.\'\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, the crowd round the doors looked as thick as flies in the\r\njam-making season.\r\n\r\n\'I wish we\'d never seen the Phoenix,\' cried Jane.\r\n\r\nEven at that awful moment Robert looked round to see if the bird\r\nhad overheard a speech which, however natural, was hardly polite or\r\ngrateful.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix was gone.\r\n\r\n\'Look here,\' said Cyril, \'I\'ve read about fires in papers; I\'m sure it\'s\r\nall right. Let\'s wait here, as father said.\'\r\n\r\n\'We can\'t do anything else,\' said Anthea bitterly.\r\n\r\n\'Look here,\' said Robert, \'I\'m NOT frightened--no, I\'m not. The Phoenix\r\nhas never been a skunk yet, and I\'m certain it\'ll see us through\r\nsomehow. I believe in the Phoenix!\'\r\n\r\n\'The Phoenix thanks you, O Robert,\' said a golden voice at his feet, and\r\nthere was the Phoenix itself, on the Wishing Carpet.\r\n\r\n\'Quick!\' it said. \'Stand on those portions of the carpet which are truly\r\nantique and authentic--and--\'\r\n\r\nA sudden jet of flame stopped its words. Alas! the Phoenix had\r\nunconsciously warmed to its subject, and in the unintentional heat of\r\nthe moment had set fire to the paraffin with which that morning the\r\nchildren had anointed the carpet. It burned merrily. The children tried\r\nin vain to stamp it out. They had to stand back and let it burn itself\r\nout. When the paraffin had burned away it was found that it had taken\r\nwith it all the darns of Scotch heather-mixture fingering. Only the\r\nfabric of the old carpet was left--and that was full of holes.\r\n\r\n\'Come,\' said the Phoenix, \'I\'m cool now.\'\r\n\r\nThe four children got on to what was left of the carpet. Very careful\r\nthey were not to leave a leg or a hand hanging over one of the holes. It\r\nwas very hot--the theatre was a pit of fire. Every one else had got out.\r\n\r\nJane had to sit on Anthea\'s lap.\r\n\r\n\'Home!\' said Cyril, and instantly the cool draught from under the\r\nnursery door played upon their legs as they sat. They were all on\r\nthe carpet still, and the carpet was lying in its proper place on the\r\nnursery floor, as calm and unmoved as though it had never been to the\r\ntheatre or taken part in a fire in its life.\r\n\r\nFour long breaths of deep relief were instantly breathed. The draught\r\nwhich they had never liked before was for the moment quite pleasant. And\r\nthey were safe. And every one else was safe. The theatre had been quite\r\nempty when they left. Every one was sure of that.\r\n\r\nThey presently found themselves all talking at once. Somehow none of\r\ntheir adventures had given them so much to talk about. None other had\r\nseemed so real.\r\n\r\n\'Did you notice--?\' they said, and \'Do you remember--?\'\r\n\r\nWhen suddenly Anthea\'s face turned pale under the dirt which it had\r\ncollected on it during the fire.\r\n\r\n\'Oh,\' she cried, \'mother and father! Oh, how awful! They\'ll think we\'re\r\nburned to cinders. Oh, let\'s go this minute and tell them we aren\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'We should only miss them,\' said the sensible Cyril.\r\n\r\n\'Well--YOU go then,\' said Anthea, \'or I will. Only do wash your face\r\nfirst. Mother will be sure to think you are burnt to a cinder if she\r\nsees you as black as that, and she\'ll faint or be ill or something. Oh,\r\nI wish we\'d never got to know that Phoenix.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hush!\' said Robert; \'it\'s no use being rude to the bird. I suppose it\r\ncan\'t help its nature. Perhaps we\'d better wash too. Now I come to think\r\nof it my hands are rather--\'\r\n\r\nNo one had noticed the Phoenix since it had bidden them to step on the\r\ncarpet. And no one noticed that no one had noticed.\r\n\r\nAll were partially clean, and Cyril was just plunging into his\r\ngreat-coat to go and look for his parents--he, and not unjustly, called\r\nit looking for a needle in a bundle of hay--when the sound of father\'s\r\nlatchkey in the front door sent every one bounding up the stairs.\r\n\r\n\'Are you all safe?\' cried mother\'s voice; \'are you all safe?\' and the\r\nnext moment she was kneeling on the linoleum of the hall, trying to\r\nkiss four damp children at once, and laughing and crying by turns, while\r\nfather stood looking on and saying he was blessed or something.\r\n\r\n\'But how did you guess we\'d come home,\' said Cyril, later, when every\r\none was calm enough for talking.\r\n\r\n\'Well, it was rather a rum thing. We heard the Garrick was on fire, and\r\nof course we went straight there,\' said father, briskly. \'We couldn\'t\r\nfind you, of course--and we couldn\'t get in--but the firemen told\r\nus every one was safely out. And then I heard a voice at my ear say,\r\n"Cyril, Anthea, Robert, and Jane"--and something touched me on the\r\nshoulder. It was a great yellow pigeon, and it got in the way of my\r\nseeing who\'d spoken. It fluttered off, and then some one said in the\r\nother ear, "They\'re safe at home"; and when I turned again, to see who\r\nit was speaking, hanged if there wasn\'t that confounded pigeon on my\r\nother shoulder. Dazed by the fire, I suppose. Your mother said it was\r\nthe voice of--\'\r\n\r\n\'I said it was the bird that spoke,\' said mother, \'and so it was. Or at\r\nleast I thought so then. It wasn\'t a pigeon. It was an orange-coloured\r\ncockatoo. I don\'t care who it was that spoke. It was true and you\'re\r\nsafe.\'\r\n\r\nMother began to cry again, and father said bed was a good place after\r\nthe pleasures of the stage.\r\n\r\nSo every one went there.\r\n\r\nRobert had a talk to the Phoenix that night.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, very well,\' said the bird, when Robert had said what he felt,\r\n\'didn\'t you know that I had power over fire? Do not distress yourself.\r\nI, like my high priests in Lombard Street, can undo the work of flames.\r\nKindly open the casement.\'\r\n\r\nIt flew out.\r\n\r\nThat was why the papers said next day that the fire at the theatre had\r\ndone less damage than had been anticipated. As a matter of fact it had\r\ndone none, for the Phoenix spent the night in putting things straight.\r\nHow the management accounted for this, and how many of the theatre\r\nofficials still believe that they were mad on that night will never be\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day mother saw the burnt holes in the carpet.\r\n\r\n\'It caught where it was paraffiny,\' said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'I must get rid of that carpet at once,\' said mother.\r\n\r\nBut what the children said in sad whispers to each other, as they\r\npondered over last night\'s events, was--\r\n\r\n\'We must get rid of that Phoenix.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12. THE END OF THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Egg, toast, tea, milk, tea-cup and saucer, egg-spoon, knife,\r\nbutter--that\'s all, I think,\' remarked Anthea, as she put the last\r\ntouches to mother\'s breakfast-tray, and went, very carefully up the\r\nstairs, feeling for every step with her toes, and holding on to the tray\r\nwith all her fingers. She crept into mother\'s room and set the tray on a\r\nchair. Then she pulled one of the blinds up very softly.\r\n\r\n\'Is your head better, mammy dear?\' she asked, in the soft little voice\r\nthat she kept expressly for mother\'s headaches. \'I\'ve brought your\r\nbrekkie, and I\'ve put the little cloth with clover-leaves on it, the one\r\nI made you.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s very nice,\' said mother sleepily.\r\n\r\nAnthea knew exactly what to do for mothers with headaches who had\r\nbreakfast in bed. She fetched warm water and put just enough eau de\r\nCologne in it, and bathed mother\'s face and hands with the sweet-scented\r\nwater. Then mother was able to think about breakfast.\r\n\r\n\'But what\'s the matter with my girl?\' she asked, when her eyes got used\r\nto the light.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I\'m so sorry you\'re ill,\' Anthea said. \'It\'s that horrible fire and\r\nyou being so frightened. Father said so. And we all feel as if it was\r\nour faults. I can\'t explain, but--\'\r\n\r\n\'It wasn\'t your fault a bit, you darling goosie,\' mother said. \'How\r\ncould it be?\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s just what I can\'t tell you,\' said Anthea. \'I haven\'t got\r\na futile brain like you and father, to think of ways of explaining\r\neverything.\'\r\n\r\nMother laughed.\r\n\r\n\'My futile brain--or did you mean fertile?--anyway, it feels very stiff\r\nand sore this morning--but I shall be quite all right by and by. And\r\ndon\'t be a silly little pet girl. The fire wasn\'t your faults. No; I\r\ndon\'t want the egg, dear. I\'ll go to sleep again, I think. Don\'t you\r\nworry. And tell cook not to bother me about meals. You can order what\r\nyou like for lunch.\'\r\n\r\nAnthea closed the door very mousily, and instantly went downstairs and\r\nordered what she liked for lunch. She ordered a pair of turkeys, a large\r\nplum-pudding, cheese-cakes, and almonds and raisins.\r\n\r\nCook told her to go along, do. And she might as well not have ordered\r\nanything, for when lunch came it was just hashed mutton and semolina\r\npudding, and cook had forgotten the sippets for the mutton hash and the\r\nsemolina pudding was burnt.\r\n\r\nWhen Anthea rejoined the others she found them all plunged in the gloom\r\nwhere she was herself. For every one knew that the days of the carpet\r\nwere now numbered. Indeed, so worn was it that you could almost have\r\nnumbered its threads.\r\n\r\nSo that now, after nearly a month of magic happenings, the time was at\r\nhand when life would have to go on in the dull, ordinary way and Jane,\r\nRobert, Anthea, and Cyril would be just in the same position as the\r\nother children who live in Camden Town, the children whom these four had\r\nso often pitied, and perhaps a little despised.\r\n\r\n\'We shall be just like them,\' Cyril said.\r\n\r\n\'Except,\' said Robert, \'that we shall have more things to remember and\r\nbe sorry we haven\'t got.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mother\'s going to send away the carpet as soon as she\'s well enough to\r\nsee about that coconut matting. Fancy us with coconut-matting--us! And\r\nwe\'ve walked under live coconut-trees on the island where you can\'t have\r\nwhooping-cough.\'\r\n\r\n\'Pretty island,\' said the Lamb; \'paint-box sands and sea all shiny\r\nsparkly.\'\r\n\r\nHis brothers and sisters had often wondered whether he remembered that\r\nisland. Now they knew that he did.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Cyril; \'no more cheap return trips by carpet for us--that\'s\r\na dead cert.\'\r\n\r\nThey were all talking about the carpet, but what they were all thinking\r\nabout was the Phoenix.\r\n\r\nThe golden bird had been so kind, so friendly, so polite, so\r\ninstructive--and now it had set fire to a theatre and made mother ill.\r\n\r\nNobody blamed the bird. It had acted in a perfectly natural manner. But\r\nevery one saw that it must not be asked to prolong its visit. Indeed, in\r\nplain English it must be asked to go!\r\n\r\nThe four children felt like base spies and treacherous friends; and each\r\nin its mind was saying who ought not to be the one to tell the Phoenix\r\nthat there could no longer be a place for it in that happy home in\r\nCamden Town. Each child was quite sure that one of them ought to speak\r\nout in a fair and manly way, but nobody wanted to be the one.\r\n\r\nThey could not talk the whole thing over as they would have liked to do,\r\nbecause the Phoenix itself was in the cupboard, among the blackbeetles\r\nand the odd shoes and the broken chessmen.\r\n\r\nBut Anthea tried.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s very horrid. I do hate thinking things about people, and not being\r\nable to say the things you\'re thinking because of the way they would\r\nfeel when they thought what things you were thinking, and wondered\r\nwhat they\'d done to make you think things like that, and why you were\r\nthinking them.\'\r\n\r\nAnthea was so anxious that the Phoenix should not understand what she\r\nsaid that she made a speech completely baffling to all. It was not till\r\nshe pointed to the cupboard in which all believed the Phoenix to be that\r\nCyril understood.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' he said, while Jane and Robert were trying to tell each other how\r\ndeeply they didn\'t understand what Anthea were saying; \'but after recent\r\neventfulnesses a new leaf has to be turned over, and, after all,\r\nmother is more important than the feelings of any of the lower forms of\r\ncreation, however unnatural.\'\r\n\r\n\'How beautifully you do do it,\' said Anthea, absently beginning to build\r\na card-house for the Lamb--\'mixing up what you\'re saying, I mean. We\r\nought to practise doing it so as to be ready for mysterious occasions.\r\nWe\'re talking about THAT,\' she said to Jane and Robert, frowning, and\r\nnodding towards the cupboard where the Phoenix was. Then Robert and Jane\r\nunderstood, and each opened its mouth to speak.\r\n\r\n\'Wait a minute,\' said Anthea quickly; \'the game is to twist up what you\r\nwant to say so that no one can understand what you\'re saying except the\r\npeople you want to understand it, and sometimes not them.\'\r\n\r\n\'The ancient philosophers,\' said a golden voice, \'Well understood the\r\nart of which you speak.\'\r\n\r\nOf course it was the Phoenix, who had not been in the cupboard at all,\r\nbut had been cocking a golden eye at them from the cornice during the\r\nwhole conversation.\r\n\r\n\'Pretty dickie!\' remarked the Lamb. \'CANARY dickie!\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor misguided infant,\' said the Phoenix.\r\n\r\nThere was a painful pause; the four could not but think it likely that\r\nthe Phoenix had understood their very veiled allusions, accompanied as\r\nthey had been by gestures indicating the cupboard. For the Phoenix was\r\nnot wanting in intelligence.\r\n\r\n\'We were just saying--\' Cyril began, and I hope he was not going to\r\nsay anything but the truth. Whatever it was he did not say it, for the\r\nPhoenix interrupted him, and all breathed more freely as it spoke.\r\n\r\n\'I gather,\' it said, \'that you have some tidings of a fatal nature to\r\ncommunicate to our degraded black brothers who run to and fro for ever\r\nyonder.\' It pointed a claw at the cupboard, where the blackbeetles\r\nlived.\r\n\r\n\'Canary TALK,\' said the Lamb joyously; \'go and show mammy.\'\r\n\r\nHe wriggled off Anthea\'s lap.\r\n\r\n\'Mammy\'s asleep,\' said Jane, hastily. \'Come and be wild beasts in a cage\r\nunder the table.\'\r\n\r\nBut the Lamb caught his feet and hands, and even his head, so often and\r\nso deeply in the holes of the carpet that the cage, or table, had to be\r\nmoved on to the linoleum, and the carpet lay bare to sight with all its\r\nhorrid holes.\r\n\r\n\'Ah,\' said the bird, \'it isn\'t long for this world.\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Robert; \'everything comes to an end. It\'s awful.\'\r\n\r\n\'Sometimes the end is peace,\' remarked the Phoenix. \'I imagine that\r\nunless it comes soon the end of your carpet will be pieces.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Cyril, respectfully kicking what was left of the carpet. The\r\nmovement of its bright colours caught the eye of the Lamb, who went down\r\non all fours instantly and began to pull at the red and blue threads.\r\n\r\n\'Aggedydaggedygaggedy,\' murmured the Lamb; \'daggedy ag ag ag!\'\r\n\r\nAnd before any one could have winked (even if they had wanted to, and it\r\nwould not have been of the slightest use) the middle of the floor showed\r\nbare, an island of boards surrounded by a sea of linoleum. The magic\r\ncarpet was gone, AND SO WAS THE LAMB!\r\n\r\nThere was a horrible silence. The Lamb--the baby, all alone--had been\r\nwafted away on that untrustworthy carpet, so full of holes and magic.\r\nAnd no one could know where he was. And no one could follow him because\r\nthere was now no carpet to follow on.\r\n\r\nJane burst into tears, but Anthea, though pale and frantic, was\r\ndry-eyed.\r\n\r\n\'It MUST be a dream,\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s what the clergyman said,\' remarked Robert forlornly; \'but it\r\nwasn\'t, and it isn\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'But the Lamb never wished,\' said Cyril; \'he was only talking Bosh.\'\r\n\r\n\'The carpet understands all speech,\' said the Phoenix, \'even Bosh. I\r\nknow not this Boshland, but be assured that its tongue is not unknown to\r\nthe carpet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you mean, then,\' said Anthea, in white terror, \'that when he was\r\nsaying "Agglety dag," or whatever it was, that he meant something by\r\nit?\'\r\n\r\n\'All speech has meaning,\' said the Phoenix.\r\n\r\n\'There I think you\'re wrong,\' said Cyril; \'even people who talk English\r\nsometimes say things that don\'t mean anything in particular.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, never mind that now,\' moaned Anthea; \'you think "Aggety dag" meant\r\nsomething to him and the carpet?\'\r\n\r\n\'Beyond doubt it held the same meaning to the carpet as to the luckless\r\ninfant,\' the Phoenix said calmly.\r\n\r\n\'And WHAT did it mean? Oh WHAT?\'\r\n\r\n\'Unfortunately,\' the bird rejoined, \'I never studied Bosh.\'\r\n\r\nJane sobbed noisily, but the others were calm with what is sometimes\r\ncalled the calmness of despair. The Lamb was gone--the Lamb, their own\r\nprecious baby brother--who had never in his happy little life been for a\r\nmoment out of the sight of eyes that loved him--he was gone. He had gone\r\nalone into the great world with no other companion and protector than a\r\ncarpet with holes in it. The children had never really understood\r\nbefore what an enormously big place the world is. And the Lamb might be\r\nanywhere in it!\r\n\r\n\'And it\'s no use going to look for him.\' Cyril, in flat and wretched\r\ntones, only said what the others were thinking.\r\n\r\n\'Do you wish him to return?\' the Phoenix asked; it seemed to speak with\r\nsome surprise.\r\n\r\n\'Of course we do!\' cried everybody.\r\n\r\n\'Isn\'t he more trouble than he\'s worth?\' asked the bird doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\'No, no. Oh, we do want him back! We do!\'\r\n\r\n\'Then,\' said the wearer of gold plumage, \'if you\'ll excuse me, I\'ll just\r\npop out and see what I can do.\'\r\n\r\nCyril flung open the window, and the Phoenix popped out.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, if only mother goes on sleeping! Oh, suppose she wakes up and wants\r\nthe Lamb! Oh, suppose the servants come! Stop crying, Jane. It\'s no\r\nearthly good. No, I\'m not crying myself--at least I wasn\'t till you said\r\nso, and I shouldn\'t anyway if--if there was any mortal thing we could\r\ndo. Oh, oh, oh!\'\r\n\r\nCyril and Robert were boys, and boys never cry, of course. Still, the\r\nposition was a terrible one, and I do not wonder that they made faces in\r\ntheir efforts to behave in a really manly way.\r\n\r\nAnd at this awful moment mother\'s bell rang.\r\n\r\nA breathless stillness held the children. Then Anthea dried her eyes.\r\nShe looked round her and caught up the poker. She held it out to Cyril.\r\n\r\n\'Hit my hand hard,\' she said; \'I must show mother some reason for my\r\neyes being like they are. Harder,\' she cried as Cyril gently tapped her\r\nwith the iron handle. And Cyril, agitated and trembling, nerved himself\r\nto hit harder, and hit very much harder than he intended.\r\n\r\nAnthea screamed.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Panther, I didn\'t mean to hurt, really,\' cried Cyril, clattering\r\nthe poker back into the fender.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s--all--right,\' said Anthea breathlessly, clasping the hurt hand\r\nwith the one that wasn\'t hurt; \'it\'s--getting--red.\'\r\n\r\nIt was--a round red and blue bump was rising on the back of it. \'Now,\r\nRobert,\' she said, trying to breathe more evenly, \'you go out--oh, I\r\ndon\'t know where--on to the dustbin--anywhere--and I shall tell mother\r\nyou and the Lamb are out.\'\r\n\r\nAnthea was now ready to deceive her mother for as long as ever she\r\ncould. Deceit is very wrong, we know, but it seemed to Anthea that it\r\nwas her plain duty to keep her mother from being frightened about the\r\nLamb as long as possible. And the Phoenix might help.\r\n\r\n\'It always has helped,\' Robert said; \'it got us out of the tower, and\r\neven when it made the fire in the theatre it got us out all right. I\'m\r\ncertain it will manage somehow.\'\r\n\r\nMother\'s bell rang again.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Eliza\'s never answered it,\' cried Anthea; \'she never does. Oh, I\r\nmust go.\'\r\n\r\nAnd she went.\r\n\r\nHer heart beat bumpingly as she climbed the stairs. Mother would be\r\ncertain to notice her eyes--well, her hand would account for that. But\r\nthe Lamb--\r\n\r\n\'No, I must NOT think of the Lamb, she said to herself, and bit her\r\ntongue till her eyes watered again, so as to give herself something\r\nelse to think of. Her arms and legs and back, and even her tear-reddened\r\nface, felt stiff with her resolution not to let mother be worried if she\r\ncould help it.\r\n\r\nShe opened the door softly.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, mother?\' she said.\r\n\r\n\'Dearest,\' said mother, \'the Lamb--\'\r\n\r\nAnthea tried to be brave. She tried to say that the Lamb and Robert were\r\nout. Perhaps she tried too hard. Anyway, when she opened her mouth no\r\nwords came. So she stood with it open. It seemed easier to keep from\r\ncrying with one\'s mouth in that unusual position.\r\n\r\n\'The Lamb,\' mother went on; \'he was very good at first, but he\'s pulled\r\nthe toilet-cover off the dressing-table with all the brushes and\r\npots and things, and now he\'s so quiet I\'m sure he\'s in some dreadful\r\nmischief. And I can\'t see him from here, and if I\'d got out of bed to\r\nsee I\'m sure I should have fainted.\'\r\n\r\n\'Do you mean he\'s HERE?\' said Anthea.\r\n\r\n\'Of course he\'s here,\' said mother, a little impatiently. \'Where did you\r\nthink he was?\'\r\n\r\nAnthea went round the foot of the big mahogany bed. There was a pause.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s not here NOW,\' she said.\r\n\r\nThat he had been there was plain, from the toilet-cover on the floor,\r\nthe scattered pots and bottles, the wandering brushes and combs, all\r\ninvolved in the tangle of ribbons and laces which an open drawer had\r\nyielded to the baby\'s inquisitive fingers.\r\n\r\n\'He must have crept out, then,\' said mother; \'do keep him with you,\r\nthere\'s a darling. If I don\'t get some sleep I shall be a wreck when\r\nfather comes home.\'\r\n\r\nAnthea closed the door softly. Then she tore downstairs and burst into\r\nthe nursery, crying--\r\n\r\n\'He must have wished he was with mother. He\'s been there all the time.\r\n"Aggety dag--"\'\r\n\r\nThe unusual word was frozen on her lip, as people say in books.\r\n\r\nFor there, on the floor, lay the carpet, and on the carpet, surrounded\r\nby his brothers and by Jane, sat the Lamb. He had covered his face and\r\nclothes with vaseline and violet powder, but he was easily recognizable\r\nin spite of this disguise.\r\n\r\n\'You are right,\' said the Phoenix, who was also present; \'it is evident\r\nthat, as you say, "Aggety dag" is Bosh for "I want to be where my mother\r\nis," and so the faithful carpet understood it.\'\r\n\r\n\'But how,\' said Anthea, catching up the Lamb and hugging him--\'how did\r\nhe get back here?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh,\' said the Phoenix, \'I flew to the Psammead and wished that your\r\ninfant brother were restored to your midst, and immediately it was so.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I am glad, I am glad!\' cried Anthea, still hugging the baby. \'Oh,\r\nyou darling! Shut up, Jane! I don\'t care HOW much he comes off on\r\nme! Cyril! You and Robert roll that carpet up and put it in the\r\nbeetle-cupboard. He might say "Aggety dag" again, and it might mean\r\nsomething quite different next time. Now, my Lamb, Panther\'ll clean you\r\na little. Come on.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope the beetles won\'t go wishing,\' said Cyril, as they rolled up the\r\ncarpet.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days later mother was well enough to go out, and that evening the\r\ncoconut matting came home. The children had talked and talked, and\r\nthought and thought, but they had not found any polite way of telling\r\nthe Phoenix that they did not want it to stay any longer.\r\n\r\nThe days had been days spent by the children in embarrassment, and by\r\nthe Phoenix in sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd, now the matting was laid down, the Phoenix awoke and fluttered down\r\non to it.\r\n\r\nIt shook its crested head.\r\n\r\n\'I like not this carpet,\' it said; \'it is harsh and unyielding, and it\r\nhurts my golden feet.\'\r\n\r\n\'We\'ve jolly well got to get used to its hurting OUR golden feet,\' said\r\nCyril.\r\n\r\n\'This, then,\' said the bird, \'supersedes the Wishing Carpet.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Robert, \'if you mean that it\'s instead of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'And the magic web?\' inquired the Phoenix, with sudden eagerness.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s the rag-and-bottle man\'s day to-morrow,\' said Anthea, in a low\r\nvoice; \'he will take it away.\'\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix fluttered up to its favourite perch on the chair-back.\r\n\r\n\'Hear me!\' it cried, \'oh youthful children of men, and restrain your\r\ntears of misery and despair, for what must be must be, and I would not\r\nremember you, thousands of years hence, as base ingrates and crawling\r\nworms compact of low selfishness.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should hope not, indeed,\' said Cyril.\r\n\r\n\'Weep not,\' the bird went on; \'I really do beg that you won\'t weep.\r\n\r\nI will not seek to break the news to you gently. Let the blow fall at\r\nonce. The time has come when I must leave you.\'\r\n\r\nAll four children breathed forth a long sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\'We needn\'t have bothered so about how to break the news to it,\'\r\nwhispered Cyril.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, sigh not so,\' said the bird, gently. \'All meetings end in partings.\r\nI must leave you. I have sought to prepare you for this. Ah, do not give\r\nway!\'\r\n\r\n\'Must you really go--so soon?\' murmured Anthea. It was what she had\r\noften heard her mother say to calling ladies in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\'I must, really; thank you so much, dear,\' replied the bird, just as\r\nthough it had been one of the ladies.\r\n\r\n\'I am weary,\' it went on. \'I desire to rest--after all the happenings\r\nof this last moon I do desire really to rest, and I ask of you one last\r\nboon.\'\r\n\r\n\'Any little thing we can do,\' said Robert.\r\n\r\nNow that it had really come to parting with the Phoenix, whose favourite\r\nhe had always been, Robert did feel almost as miserable as the Phoenix\r\nthought they all did.\r\n\r\n\'I ask but the relic designed for the rag-and-bottle man. Give me what\r\nis left of the carpet and let me go.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dare we?\' said Anthea. \'Would mother mind?\'\r\n\r\n\'I have dared greatly for your sakes,\' remarked the bird.\r\n\r\n\'Well, then, we will,\' said Robert.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix fluffed out its feathers joyously.\r\n\r\n\'Nor shall you regret it, children of golden hearts,\' it said.\r\n\'Quick--spread the carpet and leave me alone; but first pile high the\r\nfire. Then, while I am immersed in the sacred preliminary rites, do ye\r\nprepare sweet-smelling woods and spices for the last act of parting.\'\r\n\r\nThe children spread out what was left of the carpet. And, after all,\r\nthough this was just what they would have wished to have happened, all\r\nhearts were sad. Then they put half a scuttle of coal on the fire and\r\nwent out, closing the door on the Phoenix--left, at last, alone with the\r\ncarpet.\r\n\r\n\'One of us must keep watch,\' said Robert, excitedly, as soon as they\r\nwere all out of the room, \'and the others can go and buy sweet woods and\r\nspices. Get the very best that money can buy, and plenty of them.\r\nDon\'t let\'s stand to a threepence or so. I want it to have a jolly good\r\nsend-off. It\'s the only thing that\'ll make us feel less horrid inside.\'\r\n\r\nIt was felt that Robert, as the pet of the Phoenix, ought to have the\r\nlast melancholy pleasure of choosing the materials for its funeral pyre.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll keep watch if you like,\' said Cyril. \'I don\'t mind. And, besides,\r\nit\'s raining hard, and my boots let in the wet. You might call and see\r\nif my other ones are "really reliable" again yet.\'\r\n\r\nSo they left Cyril, standing like a Roman sentinel outside the door\r\ninside which the Phoenix was getting ready for the great change, and\r\nthey all went out to buy the precious things for the last sad rites.\r\n\r\n\'Robert is right,\' Anthea said; \'this is no time for being careful about\r\nour money. Let\'s go to the stationer\'s first, and buy a whole packet of\r\nlead-pencils. They\'re cheaper if you buy them by the packet.\'\r\n\r\nThis was a thing that they had always wanted to do, but it needed the\r\ngreat excitement of a funeral pyre and a parting from a beloved Phoenix\r\nto screw them up to the extravagance.\r\n\r\nThe people at the stationer\'s said that the pencils were real\r\ncedar-wood, so I hope they were, for stationers should always speak\r\nthe truth. At any rate they cost one-and-fourpence. Also they spent\r\nsevenpence three-farthings on a little sandal-wood box inlaid with\r\nivory.\r\n\r\n\'Because,\' said Anthea, \'I know sandalwood smells sweet, and when it\'s\r\nburned it smells very sweet indeed.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ivory doesn\'t smell at all,\' said Robert, \'but I expect when you burn\r\nit it smells most awful vile, like bones.\'\r\n\r\nAt the grocer\'s they bought all the spices they could remember the names\r\nof--shell-like mace, cloves like blunt nails, peppercorns, the long\r\nand the round kind; ginger, the dry sort, of course; and the beautiful\r\nbloom-covered shells of fragrant cinnamon. Allspice too, and caraway\r\nseeds (caraway seeds that smelt most deadly when the time came for\r\nburning them).\r\n\r\nCamphor and oil of lavender were bought at the chemist\'s, and also a\r\nlittle scent sachet labelled \'Violettes de Parme\'.\r\n\r\nThey took the things home and found Cyril still on guard. When they had\r\nknocked and the golden voice of the Phoenix had said \'Come in,\' they\r\nwent in.\r\n\r\nThere lay the carpet--or what was left of it--and on it lay an egg,\r\nexactly like the one out of which the Phoenix had been hatched.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix was walking round and round the egg, clucking with joy and\r\npride.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve laid it, you see,\' it said, \'and as fine an egg as ever I laid in\r\nall my born days.\'\r\n\r\nEvery one said yes, it was indeed a beauty.\r\n\r\nThe things which the children had bought were now taken out of their\r\npapers and arranged on the table, and when the Phoenix had been\r\npersuaded to leave its egg for a moment and look at the materials for\r\nits last fire it was quite overcome.\r\n\r\n\'Never, never have I had a finer pyre than this will be. You shall not\r\nregret it,\' it said, wiping away a golden tear. \'Write quickly: "Go and\r\ntell the Psammead to fulfil the last wish of the Phoenix, and return\r\ninstantly".\'\r\n\r\nBut Robert wished to be polite and he wrote--\r\n\r\n\'Please go and ask the Psammead to be so kind as to fulfil the Phoenix\'s\r\nlast wish, and come straight back, if you please.\' The paper was pinned\r\nto the carpet, which vanished and returned in the flash of an eye.\r\n\r\nThen another paper was written ordering the carpet to take the egg\r\nsomewhere where it wouldn\'t be hatched for another two thousand years.\r\nThe Phoenix tore itself away from its cherished egg, which it watched\r\nwith yearning tenderness till, the paper being pinned on, the carpet\r\nhastily rolled itself up round the egg, and both vanished for ever from\r\nthe nursery of the house in Camden Town.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, dear! oh, dear! oh, dear!\' said everybody.\r\n\r\n\'Bear up,\' said the bird; \'do you think _I_ don\'t suffer, being parted\r\nfrom my precious new-laid egg like this? Come, conquer your emotions and\r\nbuild my fire.\'\r\n\r\n\'OH!\' cried Robert, suddenly, and wholly breaking down, \'I can\'t BEAR\r\nyou to go!\'\r\n\r\nThe Phoenix perched on his shoulder and rubbed its beak softly against\r\nhis ear.\r\n\r\n\'The sorrows of youth soon appear but as dreams,\' it said. \'Farewell,\r\nRobert of my heart. I have loved you well.\'\r\n\r\nThe fire had burnt to a red glow. One by one the spices and sweet woods\r\nwere laid on it. Some smelt nice and some--the caraway seeds and the\r\nViolettes de Parme sachet among them--smelt worse than you would think\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\'Farewell, farewell, farewell, farewell!\' said the Phoenix, in a\r\nfar-away voice.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, GOOD-BYE,\' said every one, and now all were in tears.\r\n\r\nThe bright bird fluttered seven times round the room and settled in the\r\nhot heart of the fire. The sweet gums and spices and woods flared and\r\nflickered around it, but its golden feathers did not burn. It seemed to\r\ngrow red-hot to the very inside heart of it--and then before the eight\r\neyes of its friends it fell together, a heap of white ashes, and the\r\nflames of the cedar pencils and the sandal-wood box met and joined above\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Whatever have you done with the carpet?\' asked mother next day.\r\n\r\n\'We gave it to some one who wanted it very much. The name began with a\r\nP,\' said Jane.\r\n\r\nThe others instantly hushed her.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, well, it wasn\'t worth twopence,\' said mother.\r\n\r\n\'The person who began with P said we shouldn\'t lose by it,\' Jane went on\r\nbefore she could be stopped.\r\n\r\n\'I daresay!\' said mother, laughing.\r\n\r\nBut that very night a great box came, addressed to the children by all\r\ntheir names. Eliza never could remember the name of the carrier who\r\nbrought it. It wasn\'t Carter Paterson or the Parcels Delivery.\r\n\r\nIt was instantly opened. It was a big wooden box, and it had to\r\nbe opened with a hammer and the kitchen poker; the long nails came\r\nsqueaking out, and boards scrunched as they were wrenched off. Inside\r\nthe box was soft paper, with beautiful Chinese patterns on it--blue and\r\ngreen and red and violet. And under the paper--well, almost everything\r\nlovely that you can think of. Everything of reasonable size, I mean;\r\nfor, of course, there were no motors or flying machines or thoroughbred\r\nchargers. But there really was almost everything else. Everything that\r\nthe children had always wanted--toys and games and books, and chocolate\r\nand candied cherries and paint-boxes and photographic cameras, and all\r\nthe presents they had always wanted to give to father and mother and the\r\nLamb, only they had never had the money for them. At the very bottom\r\nof the box was a tiny golden feather. No one saw it but Robert, and he\r\npicked it up and hid it in the breast of his jacket, which had been\r\nso often the nesting-place of the golden bird. When he went to bed the\r\nfeather was gone. It was the last he ever saw of the Phoenix.\r\n\r\nPinned to the lovely fur cloak that mother had always wanted was a\r\npaper, and it said--\r\n\r\n\'In return for the carpet. With gratitude.--P.\'\r\n\r\nYou may guess how father and mother talked it over. They decided at\r\nlast the person who had had the carpet, and whom, curiously enough, the\r\nchildren were quite unable to describe, must be an insane millionaire\r\nwho amused himself by playing at being a rag-and-bone man. But the\r\nchildren knew better.\r\n\r\nThey knew that this was the fulfilment, by the powerful Psammead, of the\r\nlast wish of the Phoenix, and that this glorious and delightful boxful\r\nof treasures was really the very, very, very end of the Phoenix and the\r\nCarpet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Phoenix and the Carpet, by E.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
