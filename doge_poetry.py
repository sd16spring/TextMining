""" TITLE: MINI-PROJECT 3
	NAME: EMILY YEH
	DATE: MARCH 12, 2016
	DESCRIPTION: Generates a poem using words from Shakespeare's texts (which I mined from Project Gutenberg's website).
	ADDITIONAL NOTES: I added a 'clean_gutenberg_text' function, added more prepositions to my list, made the final 'poem' function loopable (so it is a little more readable now), and added a bunch of fun new functions! Now, you can choose to feed doge a treat to get happy poems! If you don't feed doge a treat, then doge generates a sad poem!
