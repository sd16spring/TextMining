p48
aS"I was very disappointed with this. It's nothing but an attempt to copy \nPeter Jackson. Period. It tells no story and rips everything off of Peter \nJackson. The people responsible made no attempt whatsoever to try and make \na Tolkien movie. They sought to make a Peter Jackson clone. There is no \nstory whatsoever, just a rushed series of short clips aping Peter Jackson's \nLOTR movies. Orcs? Peter Jackson's orcs. Ring wraith? Peter Jackson's ring \nwraith. Gandalf? Jackson's Gandalf. Aragorn? Jackson's Aragorn. Gollum? \nJackson's Gollum. Talk about a complete lack of imagination. It's nothing \nbut a ripoff of someone else's movies.\n\nThere were flaws too, like Aragorn meeting a Ranger in the wild and them \nnot knowing each other. The Rangers all knew who Aragorn was, he was their \nking. Again, that is a Tolkien realism, something the makers of this short \nmade no attempt to emulate. They admire Peter Jackson and not Tolkien. \nUtterly unoriginal. Why even bother?"

aS"This and Born of Hope are really great movies for these type of small made \nmovie. I said this before and I'll say it again. Peter Jackson should ask \nthem to add it in his special features to make it a huge collection for a \nhuge series. Peter Jackson should have these kind of one film made movies. \nTo make his own movie series for extra stories in the appendices in the \nbook and more history throughout middle earth. If he does in fact first \nmake the silmarillion trilogy and extended trilogy as well. Making my \ndreams come true. As his own middle earth series would really make it come \nto life since peter jackson Is basically the one person that can bring the \nbest world to life. Please peter jackson make my dream come true!!!!!."
p57
aS'Why Bilbo Baggins and Frodo who have the RING are the survivors, but the \nrest of others who are so strong or so powerful have the RING die such as \nSauron, Gollum (Smagol), Isildur, and 9 human kings with their rings?'
p58
aS'+Lili Canal \nWhat\'s been wrong with the Ring because it\'s been staying with the hobbits \n(Gollum, Bilbo, Frodo) most of the time in all 6 movies until it got \ndestroyed? The prolog in the first movie "The Fellowship of the Ring" says \nOne Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bind them \n...Well it does not happen for the Ring to rule the whole world of the \nMiddle Earth.   It NEVER finds its way back to the evil side of Sauron. One \nRing does not bind them nor united them because it\'s finally eternally dead \nin the volcano larva.'
p59
aS'+Xi Le Hobbits\'s main desire is for a stable, invoilate home. Basically, \nwhat they want most (with the exception of travel-perverts such as the \nyoung Bilbo), is just 1) to be left alone, and 2) to have tea. \n\nHence not so much in destroying-others tricks from Hobbits, even when \ncorrupted. Wizards, on the other hand, who\'ve been on the trail of power \ntheir whole lives... \n\nThe effectiveness of the Ring\'s attack, is of course that it attacks where \nits bearer is weakest. Note that this also means the bearer will be less \nable to see the oncoming effects of the perversion for themselves, since \nthose effects will arise in a locus of their psyches that they are not so \nfamiliar with. \n\nHumans, for example, will continue to think that amassing personal power \nand demonstrating it is a "good" thing, even while the Ring twists \neverything in their minds around that "need." Perverse Hobbits, on the \nother hand, will only dig their holes deeper. THAT is why they survive the \nencounter.'
p60
aS'No...hobbits have the highest desire to wield power....'
p61
aS'+Lili Canal And also, would be pretty stupid to see a hobbit rule middle \nearth.'
p62
aS'+Xi Le : Well, they eventually become "addicted" to the Ring too, as I\'m \nsure you know. But both Bilbo and Frodo are more resilient to the power of \nthe Ring than most people, because they have no desire to use that \npower. The more you desire power, the more dangerous the Ring is for you.\n\nRemember Gandalf\'s quote to Frodo: "I would take this Ring from a desire to \ndo good, but through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to \nimagine." Gandalf is afraid to take the Ring, because he knows he would be \ncorrupted quite easily.\n\nPS: Gollum or Isildur didn\'t die because of the Ring per se. Sauron is the \nonly one whose life is directly connected to the Ring.'
p63
aS'+You rude How about Bilbo Baggins and Frodo become corrupted or not?'
p64
aS'Cause the stronger and powerful you are..The more the ring corrupt.'
