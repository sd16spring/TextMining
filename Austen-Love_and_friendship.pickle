You are this day 55. If a woman\r\nmay ever be said to be in safety from the determined Perseverance of\r\ndisagreeable Lovers and the cruel Persecutions of obstinate Fathers,\r\nsurely it must be at such a time of Life. Isabel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 2nd LAURA to ISABEL\r\n\r\nAltho\' I cannot agree with you in supposing that I shall never again be\r\nexposed to Misfortunes as unmerited as those I have already experienced,\r\nyet to avoid the imputation of Obstinacy or ill-nature, I will gratify\r\nthe curiosity of your daughter; and may the fortitude with which I have\r\nsuffered the many afflictions of my past Life, prove to her a useful\r\nlesson for the support of those which may befall her in her own. Laura\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 3rd LAURA to MARIANNE\r\n\r\nAs the Daughter of my most intimate freind I think you entitled to that\r\nknowledge of my unhappy story, which your Mother has so often solicited\r\nme to give you.\r\n\r\nMy Father was a native of Ireland and an inhabitant of Wales; my Mother\r\nwas the natural Daughter of a Scotch Peer by an italian Opera-girl--I\r\nwas born in Spain and received my Education at a Convent in France.\r\n\r\nWhen I had reached my eighteenth Year I was recalled by my Parents to\r\nmy paternal roof in Wales. Our mansion was situated in one of the most\r\nromantic parts of the Vale of Uske. Tho\' my Charms are now considerably\r\nsoftened and somewhat impaired by the Misfortunes I have undergone, I\r\nwas once beautiful. But lovely as I was the Graces of my Person were the\r\nleast of my Perfections. Of every accomplishment accustomary to my sex,\r\nI was Mistress. When in the Convent, my progress had always exceeded my\r\ninstructions, my Acquirements had been wonderfull for my age, and I had\r\nshortly surpassed my Masters.\r\n\r\nIn my Mind, every Virtue that could adorn it was centered; it was the\r\nRendez-vous of every good Quality and of every noble sentiment.\r\n\r\nA sensibility too tremblingly alive to every affliction of my Freinds,\r\nmy Acquaintance and particularly to every affliction of my own, was my\r\nonly fault, if a fault it could be called. Alas! how altered now! Tho\'\r\nindeed my own Misfortunes do not make less impression on me than they\r\never did, yet now I never feel for those of an other. My accomplishments\r\ntoo, begin to fade--I can neither sing so well nor Dance so gracefully\r\nas I once did--and I have entirely forgot the MINUET DELA COUR. Adeiu.\r\nLaura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 4th Laura to MARIANNE\r\n\r\nOur neighbourhood was small, for it consisted only of your Mother. She\r\nmay probably have already told you that being left by her Parents\r\nin indigent Circumstances she had retired into Wales on eoconomical\r\nmotives. There it was our freindship first commenced. Isobel was then\r\none and twenty. Tho\' pleasing both in her Person and Manners (between\r\nourselves) she never possessed the hundredth part of my Beauty or\r\nAccomplishments. Isabel had seen the World. She had passed 2 Years at\r\none of the first Boarding-schools in London; had spent a fortnight in\r\nBath and had supped one night in Southampton.\r\n\r\n"Beware my Laura (she would often say) Beware of the insipid Vanities\r\nand idle Dissipations of the Metropolis of England; Beware of the\r\nunmeaning Luxuries of Bath and of the stinking fish of Southampton."\r\n\r\n"Alas! (exclaimed I) how am I to avoid those evils I shall never\r\nbe exposed to? What probability is there of my ever tasting the\r\nDissipations of London, the Luxuries of Bath, or the stinking Fish of\r\nSouthampton? I who am doomed to waste my Days of Youth and Beauty in an\r\nhumble Cottage in the Vale of Uske."\r\n\r\nAh! little did I then think I was ordained so soon to quit that humble\r\nCottage for the Deceitfull Pleasures of the World. Adeiu Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 5th LAURA to MARIANNE\r\n\r\nOne Evening in December as my Father, my Mother and myself, were\r\narranged in social converse round our Fireside, we were on a sudden\r\ngreatly astonished, by hearing a violent knocking on the outward door of\r\nour rustic Cot.\r\n\r\nMy Father started--"What noise is that," (said he.) "It sounds like a\r\nloud rapping at the door"--(replied my Mother.) "it does indeed." (cried\r\nI.) "I am of your opinion; (said my Father) it certainly does appear\r\nto proceed from some uncommon violence exerted against our unoffending\r\ndoor." "Yes (exclaimed I) I cannot help thinking it must be somebody who\r\nknocks for admittance."\r\n\r\n"That is another point (replied he;) We must not pretend to determine\r\non what motive the person may knock--tho\' that someone DOES rap at the\r\ndoor, I am partly convinced."\r\n\r\nHere, a 2d tremendous rap interrupted my Father in his speech, and\r\nsomewhat alarmed my Mother and me.\r\n\r\n"Had we better not go and see who it is? (said she) the servants are\r\nout." "I think we had." (replied I.) "Certainly, (added my Father)\r\nby all means." "Shall we go now?" (said my Mother,) "The sooner the\r\nbetter." (answered he.) "Oh! let no time be lost" (cried I.)\r\n\r\nA third more violent Rap than ever again assaulted our ears. "I am\r\ncertain there is somebody knocking at the Door." (said my Mother.)\r\n"I think there must," (replied my Father) "I fancy the servants are\r\nreturned; (said I) I think I hear Mary going to the Door." "I\'m glad of\r\nit (cried my Father) for I long to know who it is."\r\n\r\nI was right in my conjecture; for Mary instantly entering the Room,\r\ninformed us that a young Gentleman and his Servant were at the door, who\r\nhad lossed their way, were very cold and begged leave to warm themselves\r\nby our fire.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you admit them?" (said I.) "You have no objection, my Dear?"\r\n(said my Father.) "None in the World." (replied my Mother.)\r\n\r\nMary, without waiting for any further commands immediately left the room\r\nand quickly returned introducing the most beauteous and amiable Youth, I\r\nhad ever beheld. The servant she kept to herself.\r\n\r\nMy natural sensibility had already been greatly affected by the\r\nsufferings of the unfortunate stranger and no sooner did I first behold\r\nhim, than I felt that on him the happiness or Misery of my future Life\r\nmust depend. Adeiu Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 6th LAURA to MARIANNE\r\n\r\nThe noble Youth informed us that his name was Lindsay--for particular\r\nreasons however I shall conceal it under that of Talbot. He told us that\r\nhe was the son of an English Baronet, that his Mother had been for many\r\nyears no more and that he had a Sister of the middle size. "My Father\r\n(he continued) is a mean and mercenary wretch--it is only to such\r\nparticular freinds as this Dear Party that I would thus betray his\r\nfailings. Your Virtues my amiable Polydore (addressing himself to my\r\nfather) yours Dear Claudia and yours my Charming Laura call on me to\r\nrepose in you, my confidence." We bowed. "My Father seduced by the false\r\nglare of Fortune and the Deluding Pomp of Title, insisted on my giving\r\nmy hand to Lady Dorothea. No never exclaimed I. Lady Dorothea is lovely\r\nand Engaging; I prefer no woman to her; but know Sir, that I scorn to\r\nmarry her in compliance with your Wishes. No! Never shall it be said\r\nthat I obliged my Father."\r\n\r\nWe all admired the noble Manliness of his reply. He continued.\r\n\r\n"Sir Edward was surprised; he had perhaps little expected to meet with\r\nso spirited an opposition to his will. "Where, Edward in the name of\r\nwonder (said he) did you pick up this unmeaning gibberish? You have\r\nbeen studying Novels I suspect." I scorned to answer: it would have\r\nbeen beneath my dignity. I mounted my Horse and followed by my faithful\r\nWilliam set forth for my Aunts."\r\n\r\n"My Father\'s house is situated in Bedfordshire, my Aunt\'s in Middlesex,\r\nand tho\' I flatter myself with being a tolerable proficient in\r\nGeography, I know not how it happened, but I found myself entering this\r\nbeautifull Vale which I find is in South Wales, when I had expected to\r\nhave reached my Aunts."\r\n\r\n"After having wandered some time on the Banks of the Uske without\r\nknowing which way to go, I began to lament my cruel Destiny in the\r\nbitterest and most pathetic Manner. It was now perfectly dark, not a\r\nsingle star was there to direct my steps, and I know not what might have\r\nbefallen me had I not at length discerned thro\' the solemn Gloom that\r\nsurrounded me a distant light, which as I approached it, I discovered\r\nto be the chearfull Blaze of your fire. Impelled by the combination\r\nof Misfortunes under which I laboured, namely Fear, Cold and Hunger I\r\nhesitated not to ask admittance which at length I have gained; and\r\nnow my Adorable Laura (continued he taking my Hand) when may I hope\r\nto receive that reward of all the painfull sufferings I have undergone\r\nduring the course of my attachment to you, to which I have ever aspired.\r\nOh! when will you reward me with Yourself?"\r\n\r\n"This instant, Dear and Amiable Edward." (replied I.). We were\r\nimmediately united by my Father, who tho\' he had never taken orders had\r\nbeen bred to the Church. Adeiu Laura\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 7th LAURA to MARIANNE\r\n\r\nWe remained but a few days after our Marriage, in the Vale of Uske.\r\nAfter taking an affecting Farewell of my Father, my Mother and my\r\nIsabel, I accompanied Edward to his Aunt\'s in Middlesex. Philippa\r\nreceived us both with every expression of affectionate Love. My arrival\r\nwas indeed a most agreable surprise to her as she had not only been\r\ntotally ignorant of my Marriage with her Nephew, but had never even had\r\nthe slightest idea of there being such a person in the World.\r\n\r\nAugusta, the sister of Edward was on a visit to her when we arrived.\r\nI found her exactly what her Brother had described her to be--of the\r\nmiddle size. She received me with equal surprise though not with equal\r\nCordiality, as Philippa. There was a disagreable coldness and Forbidding\r\nReserve in her reception of me which was equally distressing and\r\nUnexpected. None of that interesting Sensibility or amiable simpathy\r\nin her manners and Address to me when we first met which should have\r\ndistinguished our introduction to each other. Her Language was neither\r\nwarm, nor affectionate, her expressions of regard were neither animated\r\nnor cordial; her arms were not opened to receive me to her Heart, tho\'\r\nmy own were extended to press her to mine.\r\n\r\nA short Conversation between Augusta and her Brother, which I\r\naccidentally overheard encreased my dislike to her, and convinced me\r\nthat her Heart was no more formed for the soft ties of Love than for the\r\nendearing intercourse of Freindship.\r\n\r\n"But do you think that my Father will ever be reconciled to this\r\nimprudent connection?" (said Augusta.)\r\n\r\n"Augusta (replied the noble Youth) I thought you had a better opinion of\r\nme, than to imagine I would so abjectly degrade myself as to consider\r\nmy Father\'s Concurrence in any of my affairs, either of Consequence\r\nor concern to me. Tell me Augusta with sincerity; did you ever know\r\nme consult his inclinations or follow his Advice in the least trifling\r\nParticular since the age of fifteen?"\r\n\r\n"Edward (replied she) you are surely too diffident in your own praise.\r\nSince you were fifteen only! My Dear Brother since you were five years\r\nold, I entirely acquit you of ever having willingly contributed to the\r\nsatisfaction of your Father. But still I am not without apprehensions\r\nof your being shortly obliged to degrade yourself in your own eyes by\r\nseeking a support for your wife in the Generosity of Sir Edward."\r\n\r\n"Never, never Augusta will I so demean myself. (said Edward). Support!\r\nWhat support will Laura want which she can receive from him?"\r\n\r\n"Only those very insignificant ones of Victuals and Drink." (answered\r\nshe.)\r\n\r\n"Victuals and Drink! (replied my Husband in a most nobly contemptuous\r\nManner) and dost thou then imagine that there is no other support for\r\nan exalted mind (such as is my Laura\'s) than the mean and indelicate\r\nemployment of Eating and Drinking?"\r\n\r\n"None that I know of, so efficacious." (returned Augusta).\r\n\r\n"And did you then never feel the pleasing Pangs of Love, Augusta?\r\n(replied my Edward). Does it appear impossible to your vile and\r\ncorrupted Palate, to exist on Love? Can you not conceive the Luxury of\r\nliving in every distress that Poverty can inflict, with the object of\r\nyour tenderest affection?"\r\n\r\n"You are too ridiculous (said Augusta) to argue with; perhaps however\r\nyou may in time be convinced that..."\r\n\r\nHere I was prevented from hearing the remainder of her speech, by the\r\nappearance of a very Handsome young Woman, who was ushured into the Room\r\nat the Door of which I had been listening. On hearing her announced by\r\nthe Name of "Lady Dorothea," I instantly quitted my Post and followed\r\nher into the Parlour, for I well remembered that she was the Lady,\r\nproposed as a Wife for my Edward by the Cruel and Unrelenting Baronet.\r\n\r\nAltho\' Lady Dorothea\'s visit was nominally to Philippa and Augusta, yet\r\nI have some reason to imagine that (acquainted with the Marriage and\r\narrival of Edward) to see me was a principal motive to it.\r\n\r\nI soon perceived that tho\' Lovely and Elegant in her Person and tho\'\r\nEasy and Polite in her Address, she was of that inferior order of\r\nBeings with regard to Delicate Feeling, tender Sentiments, and refined\r\nSensibility, of which Augusta was one.\r\n\r\nShe staid but half an hour and neither in the Course of her Visit,\r\nconfided to me any of her secret thoughts, nor requested me to confide\r\nin her, any of Mine. You will easily imagine therefore my Dear Marianne\r\nthat I could not feel any ardent affection or very sincere Attachment\r\nfor Lady Dorothea. Adeiu Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 8th LAURA to MARIANNE, in continuation\r\n\r\nLady Dorothea had not left us long before another visitor as unexpected\r\na one as her Ladyship, was announced. It was Sir Edward, who informed\r\nby Augusta of her Brother\'s marriage, came doubtless to reproach him for\r\nhaving dared to unite himself to me without his Knowledge. But Edward\r\nforeseeing his design, approached him with heroic fortitude as soon as\r\nhe entered the Room, and addressed him in the following Manner.\r\n\r\n"Sir Edward, I know the motive of your Journey here--You come with the\r\nbase Design of reproaching me for having entered into an indissoluble\r\nengagement with my Laura without your Consent. But Sir, I glory in the\r\nAct--. It is my greatest boast that I have incurred the displeasure of\r\nmy Father!"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took my hand and whilst Sir Edward, Philippa, and Augusta\r\nwere doubtless reflecting with admiration on his undaunted Bravery, led\r\nme from the Parlour to his Father\'s Carriage which yet remained at the\r\nDoor and in which we were instantly conveyed from the pursuit of Sir\r\nEdward.\r\n\r\nThe Postilions had at first received orders only to take the London\r\nroad; as soon as we had sufficiently reflected However, we ordered them\r\nto Drive to M----. the seat of Edward\'s most particular freind, which\r\nwas but a few miles distant.\r\n\r\nAt M----. we arrived in a few hours; and on sending in our names were\r\nimmediately admitted to Sophia, the Wife of Edward\'s freind. After\r\nhaving been deprived during the course of 3 weeks of a real freind (for\r\nsuch I term your Mother) imagine my transports at beholding one, most\r\ntruly worthy of the Name. Sophia was rather above the middle size; most\r\nelegantly formed. A soft languor spread over her lovely features, but\r\nincreased their Beauty--. It was the Charectarestic of her Mind--. She\r\nwas all sensibility and Feeling. We flew into each others arms and after\r\nhaving exchanged vows of mutual Freindship for the rest of our Lives,\r\ninstantly unfolded to each other the most inward secrets of our\r\nHearts--. We were interrupted in the delightfull Employment by the\r\nentrance of Augustus, (Edward\'s freind) who was just returned from a\r\nsolitary ramble.\r\n\r\nNever did I see such an affecting Scene as was the meeting of Edward and\r\nAugustus.\r\n\r\n"My Life! my Soul!" (exclaimed the former) "My adorable angel!" (replied\r\nthe latter) as they flew into each other\'s arms. It was too pathetic\r\nfor the feelings of Sophia and myself--We fainted alternately on a sofa.\r\nAdeiu Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the 9th From the same to the same\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the day we received the following Letter from\r\nPhilippa.\r\n\r\n"Sir Edward is greatly incensed by your abrupt departure; he has\r\ntaken back Augusta to Bedfordshire. Much as I wish to enjoy again your\r\ncharming society, I cannot determine to snatch you from that, of such\r\ndear and deserving Freinds--When your Visit to them is terminated, I\r\ntrust you will return to the arms of your" "Philippa."\r\n\r\nWe returned a suitable answer to this affectionate Note and after\r\nthanking her for her kind invitation assured her that we would certainly\r\navail ourselves of it, whenever we might have no other place to go to.\r\nTho\' certainly nothing could to any reasonable Being, have appeared more\r\nsatisfactory, than so gratefull a reply to her invitation, yet I know\r\nnot how it was, but she was certainly capricious enough to be displeased\r\nwith our behaviour and in a few weeks after, either to revenge our\r\nConduct, or releive her own solitude, married a young and illiterate\r\nFortune-hunter. This imprudent step (tho\' we were sensible that it would\r\nprobably deprive us of that fortune which Philippa had ever taught us to\r\nexpect) could not on our own accounts, excite from our exalted minds a\r\nsingle sigh; yet fearfull lest it might prove a source of endless misery\r\nto the deluded Bride, our trembling Sensibility was greatly affected\r\nwhen we were first informed of the Event. The affectionate Entreaties of\r\nAugustus and Sophia that we would for ever consider their House as our\r\nHome, easily prevailed on us to determine never more to leave them, In\r\nthe society of my Edward and this Amiable Pair, I passed the happiest\r\nmoments of my Life; Our time was most delightfully spent, in mutual\r\nProtestations of Freindship, and in vows of unalterable Love, in which\r\nwe were secure from being interrupted, by intruding and disagreable\r\nVisitors, as Augustus and Sophia had on their first Entrance in the\r\nNeighbourhood, taken due care to inform the surrounding Families, that\r\nas their happiness centered wholly in themselves, they wished for no\r\nother society. But alas! my Dear Marianne such Happiness as I then\r\nenjoyed was too perfect to be lasting. A most severe and unexpected Blow\r\nat once destroyed every sensation of Pleasure. Convinced as you must be\r\nfrom what I have already told you concerning Augustus and Sophia, that\r\nthere never were a happier Couple, I need not I imagine, inform you that\r\ntheir union had been contrary to the inclinations of their Cruel\r\nand Mercenery Parents; who had vainly endeavoured with obstinate\r\nPerseverance to force them into a Marriage with those whom they had ever\r\nabhorred; but with a Heroic Fortitude worthy to be related and admired,\r\nthey had both, constantly refused to submit to such despotic Power.\r\n\r\nAfter having so nobly disentangled themselves from the shackles of\r\nParental Authority, by a Clandestine Marriage, they were determined\r\nnever to forfeit the good opinion they had gained in the World, in\r\nso doing, by accepting any proposals of reconciliation that might be\r\noffered them by their Fathers--to this farther tryal of their noble\r\nindependance however they never were exposed.\r\n\r\nThey had been married but a few months when our visit to them commenced\r\nduring which time they had been amply supported by a considerable sum of\r\nmoney which Augustus had gracefully purloined from his unworthy father\'s\r\nEscritoire, a few days before his union with Sophia.\r\n\r\nBy our arrival their Expenses were considerably encreased tho\' their\r\nmeans for supplying them were then nearly exhausted. But they, Exalted\r\nCreatures! scorned to reflect a moment on their pecuniary Distresses and\r\nwould have blushed at the idea of paying their Debts.--Alas! what was\r\ntheir Reward for such disinterested Behaviour! The beautifull Augustus\r\nwas arrested and we were all undone. Such perfidious Treachery in the\r\nmerciless perpetrators of the Deed will shock your gentle nature Dearest\r\nMarianne as much as it then affected the Delicate sensibility of\r\nEdward, Sophia, your Laura, and of Augustus himself. To compleat such\r\nunparalelled Barbarity we were informed that an Execution in the House\r\nwould shortly take place. Ah! what could we do but what we did! We\r\nsighed and fainted on the sofa. Adeiu Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 10th LAURA in continuation\r\n\r\nWhen we were somewhat recovered from the overpowering Effusions of our\r\ngrief, Edward desired that we would consider what was the most prudent\r\nstep to be taken in our unhappy situation while he repaired to his\r\nimprisoned freind to lament over his misfortunes. We promised that we\r\nwould, and he set forwards on his journey to Town. During his absence\r\nwe faithfully complied with his Desire and after the most mature\r\nDeliberation, at length agreed that the best thing we could do was\r\nto leave the House; of which we every moment expected the officers\r\nof Justice to take possession. We waited therefore with the greatest\r\nimpatience, for the return of Edward in order to impart to him the\r\nresult of our Deliberations. But no Edward appeared. In vain did we\r\ncount the tedious moments of his absence--in vain did we weep--in\r\nvain even did we sigh--no Edward returned--. This was too cruel, too\r\nunexpected a Blow to our Gentle Sensibility--we could not support it--we\r\ncould only faint. At length collecting all the Resolution I was Mistress\r\nof, I arose and after packing up some necessary apparel for Sophia and\r\nmyself, I dragged her to a Carriage I had ordered and we instantly set\r\nout for London. As the Habitation of Augustus was within twelve miles\r\nof Town, it was not long e\'er we arrived there, and no sooner had we\r\nentered Holboun than letting down one of the Front Glasses I enquired of\r\nevery decent-looking Person that we passed "If they had seen my Edward?"\r\n\r\nBut as we drove too rapidly to allow them to answer my repeated\r\nEnquiries, I gained little, or indeed, no information concerning him.\r\n"Where am I to drive?" said the Postilion. "To Newgate Gentle Youth\r\n(replied I), to see Augustus." "Oh! no, no, (exclaimed Sophia) I cannot\r\ngo to Newgate; I shall not be able to support the sight of my Augustus\r\nin so cruel a confinement--my feelings are sufficiently shocked by\r\nthe RECITAL, of his Distress, but to behold it will overpower my\r\nSensibility." As I perfectly agreed with her in the Justice of her\r\nSentiments the Postilion was instantly directed to return into the\r\nCountry. You may perhaps have been somewhat surprised my Dearest\r\nMarianne, that in the Distress I then endured, destitute of any support,\r\nand unprovided with any Habitation, I should never once have remembered\r\nmy Father and Mother or my paternal Cottage in the Vale of Uske. To\r\naccount for this seeming forgetfullness I must inform you of a trifling\r\ncircumstance concerning them which I have as yet never mentioned. The\r\ndeath of my Parents a few weeks after my Departure, is the circumstance\r\nI allude to. By their decease I became the lawfull Inheritress of their\r\nHouse and Fortune. But alas! the House had never been their own and\r\ntheir Fortune had only been an Annuity on their own Lives. Such is\r\nthe Depravity of the World! To your Mother I should have returned with\r\nPleasure, should have been happy to have introduced to her, my charming\r\nSophia and should with Chearfullness have passed the remainder of my\r\nLife in their dear Society in the Vale of Uske, had not one obstacle\r\nto the execution of so agreable a scheme, intervened; which was the\r\nMarriage and Removal of your Mother to a distant part of Ireland. Adeiu\r\nLaura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER 11th LAURA in continuation\r\n\r\n"I have a Relation in Scotland (said Sophia to me as we left London) who\r\nI am certain would not hesitate in receiving me." "Shall I order the Boy\r\nto drive there?" said I--but instantly recollecting myself, exclaimed,\r\n"Alas I fear it will be too long a Journey for the Horses." Unwilling\r\nhowever to act only from my own inadequate Knowledge of the Strength and\r\nAbilities of Horses, I consulted the Postilion, who was entirely of my\r\nOpinion concerning the Affair. We therefore determined to change Horses\r\nat the next Town and to travel Post the remainder of the Journey--. When\r\nwe arrived at the last Inn we were to stop at, which was but a few miles\r\nfrom the House of Sophia\'s Relation, unwilling to intrude our Society on\r\nhim unexpected and unthought of, we wrote a very elegant and well\r\npenned Note to him containing an account of our Destitute and melancholy\r\nSituation, and of our intention to spend some months with him in\r\nScotland. As soon as we had dispatched this Letter, we immediately\r\nprepared to follow it in person and were stepping into the Carriage\r\nfor that Purpose when our attention was attracted by the Entrance of\r\na coroneted Coach and 4 into the Inn-yard. A Gentleman considerably\r\nadvanced in years descended from it. At his first Appearance my\r\nSensibility was wonderfully affected and e\'er I had gazed at him a 2d\r\ntime, an instinctive sympathy whispered to my Heart, that he was my\r\nGrandfather. Convinced that I could not be mistaken in my conjecture I\r\ninstantly sprang from the Carriage I had just entered, and following the\r\nVenerable Stranger into the Room he had been shewn to, I threw myself\r\non my knees before him and besought him to acknowledge me as his Grand\r\nChild. He started, and having attentively examined my features, raised\r\nme from the Ground and throwing his Grand-fatherly arms around my Neck,\r\nexclaimed, "Acknowledge thee! Yes dear resemblance of my Laurina and\r\nLaurina\'s Daughter, sweet image of my Claudia and my Claudia\'s Mother,\r\nI do acknowledge thee as the Daughter of the one and the Grandaughter of\r\nthe other." While he was thus tenderly embracing me, Sophia astonished\r\nat my precipitate Departure, entered the Room in search of me. No sooner\r\nhad she caught the eye of the venerable Peer, than he exclaimed with\r\nevery mark of Astonishment--"Another Grandaughter! Yes, yes, I see you\r\nare the Daughter of my Laurina\'s eldest Girl; your resemblance to the\r\nbeauteous Matilda sufficiently proclaims it. "Oh!" replied Sophia, "when\r\nI first beheld you the instinct of Nature whispered me that we were in\r\nsome degree related--But whether Grandfathers, or Grandmothers, I could\r\nnot pretend to determine." He folded her in his arms, and whilst they\r\nwere tenderly embracing, the Door of the Apartment opened and a most\r\nbeautifull young Man appeared. On perceiving him Lord St. Clair started\r\nand retreating back a few paces, with uplifted Hands, said, "Another\r\nGrand-child! What an unexpected Happiness is this! to discover in the\r\nspace of 3 minutes, as many of my Descendants! This I am certain is\r\nPhilander the son of my Laurina\'s 3d girl the amiable Bertha; there\r\nwants now but the presence of Gustavus to compleat the Union of my\r\nLaurina\'s Grand-Children."\r\n\r\n"And here he is; (said a Gracefull Youth who that instant entered the\r\nroom) here is the Gustavus you desire to see. I am the son of Agatha\r\nyour Laurina\'s 4th and youngest Daughter," "I see you are indeed;\r\nreplied Lord St. Clair--But tell me (continued he looking fearfully\r\ntowards the Door) tell me, have I any other Grand-children in the\r\nHouse." "None my Lord." "Then I will provide for you all without farther\r\ndelay--Here are 4 Banknotes of 50L each--Take them and remember I\r\nhave done the Duty of a Grandfather." He instantly left the Room and\r\nimmediately afterwards the House. Adeiu, Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the 12th LAURA in continuation\r\n\r\nYou may imagine how greatly we were surprised by the sudden departure\r\nof Lord St Clair. "Ignoble Grand-sire!" exclaimed Sophia. "Unworthy\r\nGrandfather!" said I, and instantly fainted in each other\'s arms. How\r\nlong we remained in this situation I know not; but when we recovered\r\nwe found ourselves alone, without either Gustavus, Philander, or the\r\nBanknotes. As we were deploring our unhappy fate, the Door of the\r\nApartment opened and "Macdonald" was announced. He was Sophia\'s cousin.\r\nThe haste with which he came to our releif so soon after the receipt\r\nof our Note, spoke so greatly in his favour that I hesitated not to\r\npronounce him at first sight, a tender and simpathetic Freind. Alas!\r\nhe little deserved the name--for though he told us that he was much\r\nconcerned at our Misfortunes, yet by his own account it appeared that\r\nthe perusal of them, had neither drawn from him a single sigh, nor\r\ninduced him to bestow one curse on our vindictive stars--. He told\r\nSophia that his Daughter depended on her returning with him to\r\nMacdonald-Hall, and that as his Cousin\'s freind he should be happy\r\nto see me there also. To Macdonald-Hall, therefore we went, and were\r\nreceived with great kindness by Janetta the Daughter of Macdonald, and\r\nthe Mistress of the Mansion. Janetta was then only fifteen; naturally\r\nwell disposed, endowed with a susceptible Heart, and a simpathetic\r\nDisposition, she might, had these amiable qualities been properly\r\nencouraged, have been an ornament to human Nature; but unfortunately her\r\nFather possessed not a soul sufficiently exalted to admire so promising\r\na Disposition, and had endeavoured by every means on his power\r\nto prevent it encreasing with her Years. He had actually so far\r\nextinguished the natural noble Sensibility of her Heart, as to prevail\r\non her to accept an offer from a young Man of his Recommendation. They\r\nwere to be married in a few months, and Graham, was in the House when\r\nwe arrived. WE soon saw through his character. He was just such a Man as\r\none might have expected to be the choice of Macdonald. They said he was\r\nSensible, well-informed, and Agreable; we did not pretend to Judge of\r\nsuch trifles, but as we were convinced he had no soul, that he had\r\nnever read the sorrows of Werter, and that his Hair bore not the least\r\nresemblance to auburn, we were certain that Janetta could feel no\r\naffection for him, or at least that she ought to feel none. The very\r\ncircumstance of his being her father\'s choice too, was so much in his\r\ndisfavour, that had he been deserving her, in every other respect yet\r\nTHAT of itself ought to have been a sufficient reason in the Eyes of\r\nJanetta for rejecting him. These considerations we were determined to\r\nrepresent to her in their proper light and doubted not of meeting with\r\nthe desired success from one naturally so well disposed; whose errors in\r\nthe affair had only arisen from a want of proper confidence in her own\r\nopinion, and a suitable contempt of her father\'s. We found her indeed\r\nall that our warmest wishes could have hoped for; we had no difficulty\r\nto convince her that it was impossible she could love Graham, or that it\r\nwas her Duty to disobey her Father; the only thing at which she rather\r\nseemed to hesitate was our assertion that she must be attached to some\r\nother Person. For some time, she persevered in declaring that she knew\r\nno other young man for whom she had the the smallest Affection; but upon\r\nexplaining the impossibility of such a thing she said that she beleived\r\nshe DID LIKE Captain M\'Kenrie better than any one she knew besides. This\r\nconfession satisfied us and after having enumerated the good Qualities\r\nof M\'Kenrie and assured her that she was violently in love with him, we\r\ndesired to know whether he had ever in any wise declared his affection\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n"So far from having ever declared it, I have no reason to imagine that\r\nhe has ever felt any for me." said Janetta. "That he certainly adores\r\nyou (replied Sophia) there can be no doubt--. The Attachment must be\r\nreciprocal. Did he never gaze on you with admiration--tenderly press\r\nyour hand--drop an involantary tear--and leave the room abruptly?"\r\n"Never (replied she) that I remember--he has always left the room indeed\r\nwhen his visit has been ended, but has never gone away particularly\r\nabruptly or without making a bow." Indeed my Love (said I) you must be\r\nmistaken--for it is absolutely impossible that he should ever have left\r\nyou but with Confusion, Despair, and Precipitation. Consider but for a\r\nmoment Janetta, and you must be convinced how absurd it is to suppose\r\nthat he could ever make a Bow, or behave like any other Person."\r\nHaving settled this Point to our satisfaction, the next we took into\r\nconsideration was, to determine in what manner we should inform M\'Kenrie\r\nof the favourable Opinion Janetta entertained of him.... We at length\r\nagreed to acquaint him with it by an anonymous Letter which Sophia drew\r\nup in the following manner.\r\n\r\n"Oh! happy Lover of the beautifull Janetta, oh! amiable Possessor of\r\nHER Heart whose hand is destined to another, why do you thus delay a\r\nconfession of your attachment to the amiable Object of it? Oh! consider\r\nthat a few weeks will at once put an end to every flattering Hope that\r\nyou may now entertain, by uniting the unfortunate Victim of her father\'s\r\nCruelty to the execrable and detested Graham."\r\n\r\n"Alas! why do you thus so cruelly connive at the projected Misery of\r\nher and of yourself by delaying to communicate that scheme which had\r\ndoubtless long possessed your imagination? A secret Union will at once\r\nsecure the felicity of both."\r\n\r\nThe amiable M\'Kenrie, whose modesty as he afterwards assured us had\r\nbeen the only reason of his having so long concealed the violence of\r\nhis affection for Janetta, on receiving this Billet flew on the wings of\r\nLove to Macdonald-Hall, and so powerfully pleaded his Attachment to her\r\nwho inspired it, that after a few more private interveiws, Sophia and\r\nI experienced the satisfaction of seeing them depart for Gretna-Green,\r\nwhich they chose for the celebration of their Nuptials, in preference\r\nto any other place although it was at a considerable distance from\r\nMacdonald-Hall. Adeiu Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the 13th LAURA in continuation\r\n\r\nThey had been gone nearly a couple of Hours, before either Macdonald or\r\nGraham had entertained any suspicion of the affair. And they might not\r\neven then have suspected it, but for the following little Accident.\r\nSophia happening one day to open a private Drawer in Macdonald\'s Library\r\nwith one of her own keys, discovered that it was the Place where he\r\nkept his Papers of consequence and amongst them some bank notes of\r\nconsiderable amount. This discovery she imparted to me; and having\r\nagreed together that it would be a proper treatment of so vile a Wretch\r\nas Macdonald to deprive him of money, perhaps dishonestly gained, it was\r\ndetermined that the next time we should either of us happen to go that\r\nway, we would take one or more of the Bank notes from the drawer. This\r\nwell meant Plan we had often successfully put in Execution; but alas!\r\non the very day of Janetta\'s Escape, as Sophia was majestically removing\r\nthe 5th Bank-note from the Drawer to her own purse, she was suddenly\r\nmost impertinently interrupted in her employment by the entrance of\r\nMacdonald himself, in a most abrupt and precipitate Manner. Sophia (who\r\nthough naturally all winning sweetness could when occasions demanded it\r\ncall forth the Dignity of her sex) instantly put on a most forbidding\r\nlook, and darting an angry frown on the undaunted culprit, demanded in\r\na haughty tone of voice "Wherefore her retirement was thus insolently\r\nbroken in on?" The unblushing Macdonald, without even endeavouring to\r\nexculpate himself from the crime he was charged with, meanly endeavoured\r\nto reproach Sophia with ignobly defrauding him of his money... The\r\ndignity of Sophia was wounded; "Wretch (exclaimed she, hastily replacing\r\nthe Bank-note in the Drawer) how darest thou to accuse me of an Act,\r\nof which the bare idea makes me blush?" The base wretch was still\r\nunconvinced and continued to upbraid the justly-offended Sophia in such\r\nopprobious Language, that at length he so greatly provoked the gentle\r\nsweetness of her Nature, as to induce her to revenge herself on him by\r\ninforming him of Janetta\'s Elopement, and of the active Part we had\r\nboth taken in the affair. At this period of their Quarrel I entered the\r\nLibrary and was as you may imagine equally offended as Sophia at the\r\nill-grounded accusations of the malevolent and contemptible Macdonald.\r\n"Base Miscreant! (cried I) how canst thou thus undauntedly endeavour to\r\nsully the spotless reputation of such bright Excellence? Why dost thou\r\nnot suspect MY innocence as soon?" "Be satisfied Madam (replied he) I\r\nDO suspect it, and therefore must desire that you will both leave this\r\nHouse in less than half an hour."\r\n\r\n"We shall go willingly; (answered Sophia) our hearts have long detested\r\nthee, and nothing but our freindship for thy Daughter could have induced\r\nus to remain so long beneath thy roof."\r\n\r\n"Your Freindship for my Daughter has indeed been most powerfully exerted\r\nby throwing her into the arms of an unprincipled Fortune-hunter."\r\n(replied he)\r\n\r\n"Yes, (exclaimed I) amidst every misfortune, it will afford us some\r\nconsolation to reflect that by this one act of Freindship to Janetta,\r\nwe have amply discharged every obligation that we have received from her\r\nfather."\r\n\r\n"It must indeed be a most gratefull reflection, to your exalted minds."\r\n(said he.)\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had packed up our wardrobe and valuables, we left\r\nMacdonald Hall, and after having walked about a mile and a half we\r\nsate down by the side of a clear limpid stream to refresh our exhausted\r\nlimbs. The place was suited to meditation. A grove of full-grown Elms\r\nsheltered us from the East--. A Bed of full-grown Nettles from the\r\nWest--. Before us ran the murmuring brook and behind us ran the\r\nturn-pike road. We were in a mood for contemplation and in a Disposition\r\nto enjoy so beautifull a spot. A mutual silence which had for some time\r\nreigned between us, was at length broke by my exclaiming--"What a lovely\r\nscene! Alas why are not Edward and Augustus here to enjoy its Beauties\r\nwith us?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! my beloved Laura (cried Sophia) for pity\'s sake forbear recalling\r\nto my remembrance the unhappy situation of my imprisoned Husband. Alas,\r\nwhat would I not give to learn the fate of my Augustus! to know if he is\r\nstill in Newgate, or if he is yet hung. But never shall I be able so far\r\nto conquer my tender sensibility as to enquire after him. Oh! do not\r\nI beseech you ever let me again hear you repeat his beloved name--. It\r\naffects me too deeply--. I cannot bear to hear him mentioned it wounds\r\nmy feelings."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me my Sophia for having thus unwillingly offended you--" replied\r\nI--and then changing the conversation, desired her to admire the noble\r\nGrandeur of the Elms which sheltered us from the Eastern Zephyr. "Alas!\r\nmy Laura (returned she) avoid so melancholy a subject, I intreat you.\r\nDo not again wound my Sensibility by observations on those elms. They\r\nremind me of Augustus. He was like them, tall, magestic--he possessed\r\nthat noble grandeur which you admire in them."\r\n\r\nI was silent, fearfull lest I might any more unwillingly distress her by\r\nfixing on any other subject of conversation which might again remind her\r\nof Augustus.\r\n\r\n"Why do you not speak my Laura? (said she after a short pause) "I cannot\r\nsupport this silence you must not leave me to my own reflections; they\r\never recur to Augustus."\r\n\r\n"What a beautifull sky! (said I) How charmingly is the azure varied by\r\nthose delicate streaks of white!"\r\n\r\n"Oh! my Laura (replied she hastily withdrawing her Eyes from a momentary\r\nglance at the sky) do not thus distress me by calling my Attention to\r\nan object which so cruelly reminds me of my Augustus\'s blue sattin\r\nwaistcoat striped in white! In pity to your unhappy freind avoid a\r\nsubject so distressing." What could I do? The feelings of Sophia were\r\nat that time so exquisite, and the tenderness she felt for Augustus so\r\npoignant that I had not power to start any other topic, justly fearing\r\nthat it might in some unforseen manner again awaken all her sensibility\r\nby directing her thoughts to her Husband. Yet to be silent would be\r\ncruel; she had intreated me to talk.\r\n\r\nFrom this Dilemma I was most fortunately releived by an accident truly\r\napropos; it was the lucky overturning of a Gentleman\'s Phaeton, on the\r\nroad which ran murmuring behind us. It was a most fortunate accident\r\nas it diverted the attention of Sophia from the melancholy reflections\r\nwhich she had been before indulging. We instantly quitted our seats and\r\nran to the rescue of those who but a few moments before had been in so\r\nelevated a situation as a fashionably high Phaeton, but who were\r\nnow laid low and sprawling in the Dust. "What an ample subject for\r\nreflection on the uncertain Enjoyments of this World, would not that\r\nPhaeton and the Life of Cardinal Wolsey afford a thinking Mind!" said I\r\nto Sophia as we were hastening to the field of Action.\r\n\r\nShe had not time to answer me, for every thought was now engaged by the\r\nhorrid spectacle before us. Two Gentlemen most elegantly attired\r\nbut weltering in their blood was what first struck our Eyes--we\r\napproached--they were Edward and Augustus--. Yes dearest Marianne they\r\nwere our Husbands. Sophia shreiked and fainted on the ground--I screamed\r\nand instantly ran mad--. We remained thus mutually deprived of our\r\nsenses, some minutes, and on regaining them were deprived of them\r\nagain. For an Hour and a Quarter did we continue in this unfortunate\r\nsituation--Sophia fainting every moment and I running mad as often. At\r\nlength a groan from the hapless Edward (who alone retained any share\r\nof life) restored us to ourselves. Had we indeed before imagined that\r\neither of them lived, we should have been more sparing of our Greif--but\r\nas we had supposed when we first beheld them that they were no more,\r\nwe knew that nothing could remain to be done but what we were about.\r\nNo sooner did we therefore hear my Edward\'s groan than postponing our\r\nlamentations for the present, we hastily ran to the Dear Youth and\r\nkneeling on each side of him implored him not to die--. "Laura (said He\r\nfixing his now languid Eyes on me) I fear I have been overturned."\r\n\r\nI was overjoyed to find him yet sensible.\r\n\r\n"Oh! tell me Edward (said I) tell me I beseech you before you die, what\r\nhas befallen you since that unhappy Day in which Augustus was arrested\r\nand we were separated--"\r\n\r\n"I will" (said he) and instantly fetching a deep sigh, Expired--. Sophia\r\nimmediately sank again into a swoon--. MY greif was more audible. My\r\nVoice faltered, My Eyes assumed a vacant stare, my face became as pale\r\nas Death, and my senses were considerably impaired--.\r\n\r\n"Talk not to me of Phaetons (said I, raving in a frantic, incoherent\r\nmanner)--Give me a violin--. I\'ll play to him and sooth him in his\r\nmelancholy Hours--Beware ye gentle Nymphs of Cupid\'s Thunderbolts, avoid\r\nthe piercing shafts of Jupiter--Look at that grove of Firs--I see a Leg\r\nof Mutton--They told me Edward was not Dead; but they deceived me--they\r\ntook him for a cucumber--" Thus I continued wildly exclaiming on my\r\nEdward\'s Death--. For two Hours did I rave thus madly and should not\r\nthen have left off, as I was not in the least fatigued, had not Sophia\r\nwho was just recovered from her swoon, intreated me to consider that\r\nNight was now approaching and that the Damps began to fall. "And\r\nwhither shall we go (said I) to shelter us from either?" "To that white\r\nCottage." (replied she pointing to a neat Building which rose up amidst\r\nthe grove of Elms and which I had not before observed--) I agreed and we\r\ninstantly walked to it--we knocked at the door--it was opened by an old\r\nwoman; on being requested to afford us a Night\'s Lodging, she informed\r\nus that her House was but small, that she had only two Bedrooms, but\r\nthat However we should be wellcome to one of them. We were satisfied and\r\nfollowed the good woman into the House where we were greatly cheered\r\nby the sight of a comfortable fire--. She was a widow and had only one\r\nDaughter, who was then just seventeen--One of the best of ages; but\r\nalas! she was very plain and her name was Bridget..... Nothing therfore\r\ncould be expected from her--she could not be supposed to possess either\r\nexalted Ideas, Delicate Feelings or refined Sensibilities--. She was\r\nnothing more than a mere good-tempered, civil and obliging young woman;\r\nas such we could scarcely dislike here--she was only an Object of\r\nContempt--. Adeiu Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the 14th LAURA in continuation\r\n\r\nArm yourself my amiable young Freind with all the philosophy you are\r\nMistress of; summon up all the fortitude you possess, for alas! in the\r\nperusal of the following Pages your sensibility will be most severely\r\ntried. Ah! what were the misfortunes I had before experienced and which\r\nI have already related to you, to the one I am now going to inform you\r\nof. The Death of my Father and my Mother and my Husband though almost\r\nmore than my gentle Nature could support, were trifles in comparison\r\nto the misfortune I am now proceeding to relate. The morning after\r\nour arrival at the Cottage, Sophia complained of a violent pain in her\r\ndelicate limbs, accompanied with a disagreable Head-ake She attributed\r\nit to a cold caught by her continued faintings in the open air as the\r\nDew was falling the Evening before. This I feared was but too probably\r\nthe case; since how could it be otherwise accounted for that I should\r\nhave escaped the same indisposition, but by supposing that the\r\nbodily Exertions I had undergone in my repeated fits of frenzy had so\r\neffectually circulated and warmed my Blood as to make me proof against\r\nthe chilling Damps of Night, whereas, Sophia lying totally inactive\r\non the ground must have been exposed to all their severity. I was most\r\nseriously alarmed by her illness which trifling as it may appear to\r\nyou, a certain instinctive sensibility whispered me, would in the End be\r\nfatal to her.\r\n\r\nAlas! my fears were but too fully justified; she grew gradually\r\nworse--and I daily became more alarmed for her. At length she was\r\nobliged to confine herself solely to the Bed allotted us by our worthy\r\nLandlady--. Her disorder turned to a galloping Consumption and in a few\r\ndays carried her off. Amidst all my Lamentations for her (and violent\r\nyou may suppose they were) I yet received some consolation in the\r\nreflection of my having paid every attention to her, that could be\r\noffered, in her illness. I had wept over her every Day--had bathed her\r\nsweet face with my tears and had pressed her fair Hands continually in\r\nmine--. "My beloved Laura (said she to me a few Hours before she died)\r\ntake warning from my unhappy End and avoid the imprudent conduct which\r\nhad occasioned it... Beware of fainting-fits... Though at the time they\r\nmay be refreshing and agreable yet beleive me they will in the end, if\r\ntoo often repeated and at improper seasons, prove destructive to your\r\nConstitution... My fate will teach you this.. I die a Martyr to my greif\r\nfor the loss of Augustus.. One fatal swoon has cost me my Life.. Beware\r\nof swoons Dear Laura.... A frenzy fit is not one quarter so pernicious;\r\nit is an exercise to the Body and if not too violent, is I dare say\r\nconducive to Health in its consequences--Run mad as often as you chuse;\r\nbut do not faint--"\r\n\r\nThese were the last words she ever addressed to me.. It was her dieing\r\nAdvice to her afflicted Laura, who has ever most faithfully adhered to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAfter having attended my lamented freind to her Early Grave, I\r\nimmediately (tho\' late at night) left the detested Village in which\r\nshe died, and near which had expired my Husband and Augustus. I had not\r\nwalked many yards from it before I was overtaken by a stage-coach,\r\nin which I instantly took a place, determined to proceed in it to\r\nEdinburgh, where I hoped to find some kind some pitying Freind who would\r\nreceive and comfort me in my afflictions.\r\n\r\nIt was so dark when I entered the Coach that I could not distinguish\r\nthe Number of my Fellow-travellers; I could only perceive that they were\r\nmany. Regardless however of anything concerning them, I gave myself up\r\nto my own sad Reflections. A general silence prevailed--A silence, which\r\nwas by nothing interrupted but by the loud and repeated snores of one of\r\nthe Party.\r\n\r\n"What an illiterate villain must that man be! (thought I to myself) What\r\na total want of delicate refinement must he have, who can thus shock our\r\nsenses by such a brutal noise! He must I am certain be capable of every\r\nbad action! There is no crime too black for such a Character!" Thus\r\nreasoned I within myself, and doubtless such were the reflections of my\r\nfellow travellers.\r\n\r\nAt length, returning Day enabled me to behold the unprincipled Scoundrel\r\nwho had so violently disturbed my feelings. It was Sir Edward the father\r\nof my Deceased Husband. By his side sate Augusta, and on the same seat\r\nwith me were your Mother and Lady Dorothea. Imagine my surprise at\r\nfinding myself thus seated amongst my old Acquaintance. Great as was my\r\nastonishment, it was yet increased, when on looking out of Windows,\r\nI beheld the Husband of Philippa, with Philippa by his side, on the\r\nCoachbox and when on looking behind I beheld, Philander and Gustavus in\r\nthe Basket. "Oh! Heavens, (exclaimed I) is it possible that I should\r\nso unexpectedly be surrounded by my nearest Relations and Connections?"\r\nThese words roused the rest of the Party, and every eye was directed to\r\nthe corner in which I sat. "Oh! my Isabel (continued I throwing myself\r\nacross Lady Dorothea into her arms) receive once more to your Bosom the\r\nunfortunate Laura. Alas! when we last parted in the Vale of Usk, I was\r\nhappy in being united to the best of Edwards; I had then a Father and\r\na Mother, and had never known misfortunes--But now deprived of every\r\nfreind but you--"\r\n\r\n"What! (interrupted Augusta) is my Brother dead then? Tell us I intreat\r\nyou what is become of him?" "Yes, cold and insensible Nymph, (replied I)\r\nthat luckless swain your Brother, is no more, and you may now glory in\r\nbeing the Heiress of Sir Edward\'s fortune."\r\n\r\nAlthough I had always despised her from the Day I had overheard her\r\nconversation with my Edward, yet in civility I complied with hers and\r\nSir Edward\'s intreaties that I would inform them of the whole melancholy\r\naffair. They were greatly shocked--even the obdurate Heart of Sir Edward\r\nand the insensible one of Augusta, were touched with sorrow, by the\r\nunhappy tale. At the request of your Mother I related to them every\r\nother misfortune which had befallen me since we parted. Of the\r\nimprisonment of Augustus and the absence of Edward--of our arrival\r\nin Scotland--of our unexpected Meeting with our Grand-father and our\r\ncousins--of our visit to Macdonald-Hall--of the singular service we\r\nthere performed towards Janetta--of her Fathers ingratitude for it.. of\r\nhis inhuman Behaviour, unaccountable suspicions, and barbarous treatment\r\nof us, in obliging us to leave the House.. of our lamentations on the\r\nloss of Edward and Augustus and finally of the melancholy Death of my\r\nbeloved Companion.\r\n\r\nPity and surprise were strongly depictured in your Mother\'s countenance,\r\nduring the whole of my narration, but I am sorry to say, that to the\r\neternal reproach of her sensibility, the latter infinitely predominated.\r\nNay, faultless as my conduct had certainly been during the whole course\r\nof my late misfortunes and adventures, she pretended to find fault with\r\nmy behaviour in many of the situations in which I had been placed. As\r\nI was sensible myself, that I had always behaved in a manner which\r\nreflected Honour on my Feelings and Refinement, I paid little attention\r\nto what she said, and desired her to satisfy my Curiosity by informing\r\nme how she came there, instead of wounding my spotless reputation with\r\nunjustifiable Reproaches. As soon as she had complyed with my wishes in\r\nthis particular and had given me an accurate detail of every thing that\r\nhad befallen her since our separation (the particulars of which if you\r\nare not already acquainted with, your Mother will give you) I applied to\r\nAugusta for the same information respecting herself, Sir Edward and Lady\r\nDorothea.\r\n\r\nShe told me that having a considerable taste for the Beauties of Nature,\r\nher curiosity to behold the delightful scenes it exhibited in that part\r\nof the World had been so much raised by Gilpin\'s Tour to the Highlands,\r\nthat she had prevailed on her Father to undertake a Tour to Scotland and\r\nhad persuaded Lady Dorothea to accompany them. That they had arrived at\r\nEdinburgh a few Days before and from thence had made daily Excursions\r\ninto the Country around in the Stage Coach they were then in, from one\r\nof which Excursions they were at that time returning. My next enquiries\r\nwere concerning Philippa and her Husband, the latter of whom I learned\r\nhaving spent all her fortune, had recourse for subsistence to the talent\r\nin which, he had always most excelled, namely, Driving, and that\r\nhaving sold every thing which belonged to them except their Coach, had\r\nconverted it into a Stage and in order to be removed from any of his\r\nformer Acquaintance, had driven it to Edinburgh from whence he went to\r\nSterling every other Day. That Philippa still retaining her affection\r\nfor her ungratefull Husband, had followed him to Scotland and generally\r\naccompanied him in his little Excursions to Sterling. "It has only been\r\nto throw a little money into their Pockets (continued Augusta) that my\r\nFather has always travelled in their Coach to veiw the beauties of the\r\nCountry since our arrival in Scotland--for it would certainly have been\r\nmuch more agreable to us, to visit the Highlands in a Postchaise\r\nthan merely to travel from Edinburgh to Sterling and from Sterling\r\nto Edinburgh every other Day in a crowded and uncomfortable Stage." I\r\nperfectly agreed with her in her sentiments on the affair, and secretly\r\nblamed Sir Edward for thus sacrificing his Daughter\'s Pleasure for the\r\nsake of a ridiculous old woman whose folly in marrying so young a man\r\nought to be punished. His Behaviour however was entirely of a peice\r\nwith his general Character; for what could be expected from a man who\r\npossessed not the smallest atom of Sensibility, who scarcely knew the\r\nmeaning of simpathy, and who actually snored--. Adeiu Laura.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the 15th LAURA in continuation.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the town where we were to Breakfast, I was determined\r\nto speak with Philander and Gustavus, and to that purpose as soon as\r\nI left the Carriage, I went to the Basket and tenderly enquired after\r\ntheir Health, expressing my fears of the uneasiness of their situation.\r\nAt first they seemed rather confused at my appearance dreading no doubt\r\nthat I might call them to account for the money which our Grandfather\r\nhad left me and which they had unjustly deprived me of, but finding\r\nthat I mentioned nothing of the Matter, they desired me to step into\r\nthe Basket as we might there converse with greater ease. Accordingly I\r\nentered and whilst the rest of the party were devouring green tea and\r\nbuttered toast, we feasted ourselves in a more refined and sentimental\r\nManner by a confidential Conversation. I informed them of every thing\r\nwhich had befallen me during the course of my life, and at my request\r\nthey related to me every incident of theirs.\r\n\r\n"We are the sons as you already know, of the two youngest Daughters\r\nwhich Lord St Clair had by Laurina an italian opera girl. Our mothers\r\ncould neither of them exactly ascertain who were our Father, though it\r\nis generally beleived that Philander, is the son of one Philip Jones\r\na Bricklayer and that my Father was one Gregory Staves a Staymaker of\r\nEdinburgh. This is however of little consequence for as our Mothers were\r\ncertainly never married to either of them it reflects no Dishonour on\r\nour Blood, which is of a most ancient and unpolluted kind. Bertha (the\r\nMother of Philander) and Agatha (my own Mother) always lived together.\r\nThey were neither of them very rich; their united fortunes had\r\noriginally amounted to nine thousand Pounds, but as they had always\r\nlived on the principal of it, when we were fifteen it was diminished to\r\nnine Hundred. This nine Hundred they always kept in a Drawer in one\r\nof the Tables which stood in our common sitting Parlour, for the\r\nconvenience of having it always at Hand. Whether it was from this\r\ncircumstance, of its being easily taken, or from a wish of being\r\nindependant, or from an excess of sensibility (for which we were always\r\nremarkable) I cannot now determine, but certain it is that when we had\r\nreached our 15th year, we took the nine Hundred Pounds and ran away.\r\nHaving obtained this prize we were determined to manage it with eoconomy\r\nand not to spend it either with folly or Extravagance. To this purpose\r\nwe therefore divided it into nine parcels, one of which we devoted to\r\nVictuals, the 2d to Drink, the 3d to Housekeeping, the 4th to Carriages,\r\nthe 5th to Horses, the 6th to Servants, the 7th to Amusements, the 8th\r\nto Cloathes and the 9th to Silver Buckles. Having thus arranged our\r\nExpences for two months (for we expected to make the nine Hundred Pounds\r\nlast as long) we hastened to London and had the good luck to spend it in\r\n7 weeks and a Day which was 6 Days sooner than we had intended. As soon\r\nas we had thus happily disencumbered ourselves from the weight of\r\nso much money, we began to think of returning to our Mothers, but\r\naccidentally hearing that they were both starved to Death, we gave over\r\nthe design and determined to engage ourselves to some strolling Company\r\nof Players, as we had always a turn for the Stage. Accordingly we\r\noffered our services to one and were accepted; our Company was\r\nindeed rather small, as it consisted only of the Manager his wife\r\nand ourselves, but there were fewer to pay and the only inconvenience\r\nattending it was the Scarcity of Plays which for want of People to fill\r\nthe Characters, we could perform. We did not mind trifles however--.\r\nOne of our most admired Performances was MACBETH, in which we were\r\ntruly great. The Manager always played BANQUO himself, his Wife my LADY\r\nMACBETH. I did the THREE WITCHES and Philander acted ALL THE REST. To\r\nsay the truth this tragedy was not only the Best, but the only Play\r\nthat we ever performed; and after having acted it all over England, and\r\nWales, we came to Scotland to exhibit it over the remainder of Great\r\nBritain. We happened to be quartered in that very Town, where you came\r\nand met your Grandfather--. We were in the Inn-yard when his Carriage\r\nentered and perceiving by the arms to whom it belonged, and knowing\r\nthat Lord St Clair was our Grandfather, we agreed to endeavour to get\r\nsomething from him by discovering the Relationship--. You know how well\r\nit succeeded--. Having obtained the two Hundred Pounds, we instantly\r\nleft the Town, leaving our Manager and his Wife to act MACBETH by\r\nthemselves, and took the road to Sterling, where we spent our little\r\nfortune with great ECLAT. We are now returning to Edinburgh in order to\r\nget some preferment in the Acting way; and such my Dear Cousin is our\r\nHistory."\r\n\r\nI thanked the amiable Youth for his entertaining narration, and after\r\nexpressing my wishes for their Welfare and Happiness, left them in\r\ntheir little Habitation and returned to my other Freinds who impatiently\r\nexpected me.\r\n\r\nMy adventures are now drawing to a close my dearest Marianne; at least\r\nfor the present.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at Edinburgh Sir Edward told me that as the Widow of his\r\nson, he desired I would accept from his Hands of four Hundred a year. I\r\ngraciously promised that I would, but could not help observing that the\r\nunsimpathetic Baronet offered it more on account of my being the Widow\r\nof Edward than in being the refined and amiable Laura.\r\n\r\nI took up my Residence in a Romantic Village in the Highlands\r\nof Scotland where I have ever since continued, and where I can\r\nuninterrupted by unmeaning Visits, indulge in a melancholy solitude, my\r\nunceasing Lamentations for the Death of my Father, my Mother, my Husband\r\nand my Freind.\r\n\r\nAugusta has been for several years united to Graham the Man of all\r\nothers most suited to her; she became acquainted with him during her\r\nstay in Scotland.\r\n\r\nSir Edward in hopes of gaining an Heir to his Title and Estate, at the\r\nsame time married Lady Dorothea--. His wishes have been answered.\r\n\r\nPhilander and Gustavus, after having raised their reputation by their\r\nPerformances in the Theatrical Line at Edinburgh, removed to Covent\r\nGarden, where they still exhibit under the assumed names of LUVIS and\r\nQUICK.\r\n\r\nPhilippa has long paid the Debt of Nature, Her Husband however still\r\ncontinues to drive the Stage-Coach from Edinburgh to Sterling:--Adeiu my\r\nDearest Marianne. Laura.\r\n\r\nFinis\r\n\r\nJune 13th 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN UNFINISHED NOVEL IN LETTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo HENRY THOMAS AUSTEN Esqre.\r\n\r\nSir\r\n\r\nI am now availing myself of the Liberty you have frequently honoured\r\nme with of dedicating one of my Novels to you. That it is unfinished, I\r\ngreive; yet fear that from me, it will always remain so; that as far\r\nas it is carried, it should be so trifling and so unworthy of you, is\r\nanother concern to your obliged humble Servant\r\n\r\nThe Author\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs Demand and Co--please to pay Jane Austen Spinster the sum of one\r\nhundred guineas on account of your Humble Servant.\r\n\r\nH.

Lesley Castle Janry 3rd--1792.\r\n\r\nMy Brother has just left us. "Matilda (said he at parting) you and\r\nMargaret will I am certain take all the care of my dear little one, that\r\nshe might have received from an indulgent, and affectionate and amiable\r\nMother." Tears rolled down his cheeks as he spoke these words--the\r\nremembrance of her, who had so wantonly disgraced the Maternal character\r\nand so openly violated the conjugal Duties, prevented his adding\r\nanything farther; he embraced his sweet Child and after saluting Matilda\r\nand Me hastily broke from us and seating himself in his Chaise, pursued\r\nthe road to Aberdeen. Never was there a better young Man! Ah! how little\r\ndid he deserve the misfortunes he has experienced in the Marriage state.\r\nSo good a Husband to so bad a Wife! for you know my dear Charlotte that\r\nthe Worthless Louisa left him, her Child and reputation a few weeks ago\r\nin company with Danvers and dishonour. Never was there a sweeter face, a\r\nfiner form, or a less amiable Heart than Louisa owned! Her child already\r\npossesses the personal Charms of her unhappy Mother! May she inherit\r\nfrom her Father all his mental ones! Lesley is at present but five and\r\ntwenty, and has already given himself up to melancholy and Despair;\r\nwhat a difference between him and his Father! Sir George is 57 and still\r\nremains the Beau, the flighty stripling, the gay Lad, and sprightly\r\nYoungster, that his Son was really about five years back, and that HE\r\nhas affected to appear ever since my remembrance. While our father is\r\nfluttering about the streets of London, gay, dissipated, and Thoughtless\r\nat the age of 57, Matilda and I continue secluded from Mankind in our\r\nold and Mouldering Castle, which is situated two miles from Perth on a\r\nbold projecting Rock, and commands an extensive veiw of the Town and its\r\ndelightful Environs. But tho\' retired from almost all the World, (for\r\nwe visit no one but the M\'Leods, The M\'Kenzies, the M\'Phersons, the\r\nM\'Cartneys, the M\'Donalds, The M\'kinnons, the M\'lellans, the M\'kays,\r\nthe Macbeths and the Macduffs) we are neither dull nor unhappy; on the\r\ncontrary there never were two more lively, more agreable or more witty\r\ngirls, than we are; not an hour in the Day hangs heavy on our Hands. We\r\nread, we work, we walk, and when fatigued with these Employments releive\r\nour spirits, either by a lively song, a graceful Dance, or by some smart\r\nbon-mot, and witty repartee. We are handsome my dear Charlotte, very\r\nhandsome and the greatest of our Perfections is, that we are entirely\r\ninsensible of them ourselves. But why do I thus dwell on myself! Let me\r\nrather repeat the praise of our dear little Neice the innocent Louisa,\r\nwho is at present sweetly smiling in a gentle Nap, as she reposes on the\r\nsofa. The dear Creature is just turned of two years old; as handsome as\r\ntho\' 2 and 20, as sensible as tho\' 2 and 30, and as prudent as tho\' 2\r\nand 40. To convince you of this, I must inform you that she has a very\r\nfine complexion and very pretty features, that she already knows the two\r\nfirst letters in the Alphabet, and that she never tears her frocks--. If\r\nI have not now convinced you of her Beauty, Sense and Prudence, I have\r\nnothing more to urge in support of my assertion, and you will therefore\r\nhave no way of deciding the Affair but by coming to Lesley-Castle, and\r\nby a personal acquaintance with Louisa, determine for yourself. Ah! my\r\ndear Freind, how happy should I be to see you within these venerable\r\nWalls! It is now four years since my removal from School has separated\r\nme from you; that two such tender Hearts, so closely linked together by\r\nthe ties of simpathy and Freindship, should be so widely removed from\r\neach other, is vastly moving. I live in Perthshire, You in Sussex. We\r\nmight meet in London, were my Father disposed to carry me there, and\r\nwere your Mother to be there at the same time. We might meet at Bath,\r\nat Tunbridge, or anywhere else indeed, could we but be at the same place\r\ntogether. We have only to hope that such a period may arrive. My Father\r\ndoes not return to us till Autumn; my Brother will leave Scotland in a\r\nfew Days; he is impatient to travel. Mistaken Youth! He vainly flatters\r\nhimself that change of Air will heal the Wounds of a broken Heart! You\r\nwill join with me I am certain my dear Charlotte, in prayers for the\r\nrecovery of the unhappy Lesley\'s peace of Mind, which must ever be\r\nessential to that of your sincere freind M. Lesley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the SECOND From Miss C. LUTTERELL to Miss M. LESLEY in answer.\r\nGlenford Febry 12\r\n\r\nI have a thousand excuses to beg for having so long delayed thanking you\r\nmy dear Peggy for your agreable Letter, which beleive me I should not\r\nhave deferred doing, had not every moment of my time during the last\r\nfive weeks been so fully employed in the necessary arrangements for\r\nmy sisters wedding, as to allow me no time to devote either to you or\r\nmyself. And now what provokes me more than anything else is that the\r\nMatch is broke off, and all my Labour thrown away. Imagine how great\r\nthe Dissapointment must be to me, when you consider that after having\r\nlaboured both by Night and by Day, in order to get the Wedding dinner\r\nready by the time appointed, after having roasted Beef, Broiled Mutton,\r\nand Stewed Soup enough to last the new-married Couple through the\r\nHoney-moon, I had the mortification of finding that I had been Roasting,\r\nBroiling and Stewing both the Meat and Myself to no purpose. Indeed my\r\ndear Freind, I never remember suffering any vexation equal to what I\r\nexperienced on last Monday when my sister came running to me in the\r\nstore-room with her face as White as a Whipt syllabub, and told me that\r\nHervey had been thrown from his Horse, had fractured his Scull and was\r\npronounced by his surgeon to be in the most emminent Danger. "Good God!\r\n(said I) you dont say so? Why what in the name of Heaven will become\r\nof all the Victuals! We shall never be able to eat it while it is good.\r\nHowever, we\'ll call in the Surgeon to help us. I shall be able to manage\r\nthe Sir-loin myself, my Mother will eat the soup, and You and the Doctor\r\nmust finish the rest." Here I was interrupted, by seeing my poor Sister\r\nfall down to appearance Lifeless upon one of the Chests, where we keep\r\nour Table linen. I immediately called my Mother and the Maids, and at\r\nlast we brought her to herself again; as soon as ever she was sensible,\r\nshe expressed a determination of going instantly to Henry, and was so\r\nwildly bent on this Scheme, that we had the greatest Difficulty in the\r\nWorld to prevent her putting it in execution; at last however more by\r\nForce than Entreaty we prevailed on her to go into her room; we laid\r\nher upon the Bed, and she continued for some Hours in the most dreadful\r\nConvulsions. My Mother and I continued in the room with her, and when\r\nany intervals of tolerable Composure in Eloisa would allow us, we joined\r\nin heartfelt lamentations on the dreadful Waste in our provisions which\r\nthis Event must occasion, and in concerting some plan for getting rid of\r\nthem. We agreed that the best thing we could do was to begin eating them\r\nimmediately, and accordingly we ordered up the cold Ham and Fowls, and\r\ninstantly began our Devouring Plan on them with great Alacrity. We would\r\nhave persuaded Eloisa to have taken a Wing of a Chicken, but she would\r\nnot be persuaded. She was however much quieter than she had been;\r\nthe convulsions she had before suffered having given way to an almost\r\nperfect Insensibility. We endeavoured to rouse her by every means in our\r\npower, but to no purpose. I talked to her of Henry. "Dear Eloisa (said\r\nI) there\'s no occasion for your crying so much about such a trifle. (for\r\nI was willing to make light of it in order to comfort her) I beg you\r\nwould not mind it--You see it does not vex me in the least; though\r\nperhaps I may suffer most from it after all; for I shall not only be\r\nobliged to eat up all the Victuals I have dressed already, but must if\r\nHenry should recover (which however is not very likely) dress as much\r\nfor you again; or should he die (as I suppose he will) I shall still\r\nhave to prepare a Dinner for you whenever you marry any one else. So\r\nyou see that tho\' perhaps for the present it may afflict you to think\r\nof Henry\'s sufferings, Yet I dare say he\'ll die soon, and then his pain\r\nwill be over and you will be easy, whereas my Trouble will last much\r\nlonger for work as hard as I may, I am certain that the pantry cannot be\r\ncleared in less than a fortnight." Thus I did all in my power to console\r\nher, but without any effect, and at last as I saw that she did not seem\r\nto listen to me, I said no more, but leaving her with my Mother I took\r\ndown the remains of The Ham and Chicken, and sent William to ask how\r\nHenry did. He was not expected to live many Hours; he died the same day.\r\nWe took all possible care to break the melancholy Event to Eloisa in the\r\ntenderest manner; yet in spite of every precaution, her sufferings on\r\nhearing it were too violent for her reason, and she continued for many\r\nhours in a high Delirium. She is still extremely ill, and her Physicians\r\nare greatly afraid of her going into a Decline. We are therefore\r\npreparing for Bristol, where we mean to be in the course of the next\r\nweek. And now my dear Margaret let me talk a little of your affairs; and\r\nin the first place I must inform you that it is confidently reported,\r\nyour Father is going to be married; I am very unwilling to beleive so\r\nunpleasing a report, and at the same time cannot wholly discredit it. I\r\nhave written to my freind Susan Fitzgerald, for information concerning\r\nit, which as she is at present in Town, she will be very able to give\r\nme. I know not who is the Lady. I think your Brother is extremely\r\nright in the resolution he has taken of travelling, as it will perhaps\r\ncontribute to obliterate from his remembrance, those disagreable Events,\r\nwhich have lately so much afflicted him--I am happy to find that\r\ntho\' secluded from all the World, neither you nor Matilda are dull or\r\nunhappy--that you may never know what it is to, be either is the wish of\r\nyour sincerely affectionate C.L.\r\n\r\nP. S. I have this instant received an answer from my freind Susan, which\r\nI enclose to you, and on which you will make your own reflections.\r\n\r\nThe enclosed LETTER\r\n\r\nMy dear CHARLOTTE You could not have applied for information concerning\r\nthe report of Sir George Lesleys Marriage, to any one better able to\r\ngive it you than I am. Sir George is certainly married; I was myself\r\npresent at the Ceremony, which you will not be surprised at when I\r\nsubscribe myself your Affectionate Susan Lesley\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the THIRD From Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss C. LUTTERELL Lesley\r\nCastle February the 16th\r\n\r\nI have made my own reflections on the letter you enclosed to me, my\r\nDear Charlotte and I will now tell you what those reflections were.\r\nI reflected that if by this second Marriage Sir George should have a\r\nsecond family, our fortunes must be considerably diminushed--that if\r\nhis Wife should be of an extravagant turn, she would encourage him\r\nto persevere in that gay and Dissipated way of Life to which little\r\nencouragement would be necessary, and which has I fear already proved\r\nbut too detrimental to his health and fortune--that she would now become\r\nMistress of those Jewels which once adorned our Mother, and which Sir\r\nGeorge had always promised us--that if they did not come into\r\nPerthshire I should not be able to gratify my curiosity of beholding my\r\nMother-in-law and that if they did, Matilda would no longer sit at\r\nthe head of her Father\'s table--. These my dear Charlotte were the\r\nmelancholy reflections which crowded into my imagination after perusing\r\nSusan\'s letter to you, and which instantly occurred to Matilda when she\r\nhad perused it likewise. The same ideas, the same fears, immediately\r\noccupied her Mind, and I know not which reflection distressed her most,\r\nwhether the probable Diminution of our Fortunes, or her own Consequence.\r\nWe both wish very much to know whether Lady Lesley is handsome and what\r\nis your opinion of her; as you honour her with the appellation of your\r\nfreind, we flatter ourselves that she must be amiable. My Brother is\r\nalready in Paris. He intends to quit it in a few Days, and to begin his\r\nroute to Italy. He writes in a most chearfull manner, says that the air\r\nof France has greatly recovered both his Health and Spirits; that he has\r\nnow entirely ceased to think of Louisa with any degree either of Pity or\r\nAffection, that he even feels himself obliged to her for her Elopement,\r\nas he thinks it very good fun to be single again. By this, you may\r\nperceive that he has entirely regained that chearful Gaiety, and\r\nsprightly Wit, for which he was once so remarkable. When he first became\r\nacquainted with Louisa which was little more than three years ago, he\r\nwas one of the most lively, the most agreable young Men of the age--.\r\nI beleive you never yet heard the particulars of his first acquaintance\r\nwith her. It commenced at our cousin Colonel Drummond\'s; at whose house\r\nin Cumberland he spent the Christmas, in which he attained the age of\r\ntwo and twenty. Louisa Burton was the Daughter of a distant Relation of\r\nMrs. Drummond, who dieing a few Months before in extreme poverty, left\r\nhis only Child then about eighteen to the protection of any of his\r\nRelations who would protect her. Mrs. Drummond was the only one who\r\nfound herself so disposed--Louisa was therefore removed from a miserable\r\nCottage in Yorkshire to an elegant Mansion in Cumberland, and from\r\nevery pecuniary Distress that Poverty could inflict, to every elegant\r\nEnjoyment that Money could purchase--. Louisa was naturally ill-tempered\r\nand Cunning; but she had been taught to disguise her real Disposition,\r\nunder the appearance of insinuating Sweetness, by a father who but too\r\nwell knew, that to be married, would be the only chance she would\r\nhave of not being starved, and who flattered himself that with such\r\nan extroidinary share of personal beauty, joined to a gentleness of\r\nManners, and an engaging address, she might stand a good chance of\r\npleasing some young Man who might afford to marry a girl without a\r\nShilling. Louisa perfectly entered into her father\'s schemes and was\r\ndetermined to forward them with all her care and attention. By dint of\r\nPerseverance and Application, she had at length so thoroughly disguised\r\nher natural disposition under the mask of Innocence, and Softness, as to\r\nimpose upon every one who had not by a long and constant intimacy with\r\nher discovered her real Character. Such was Louisa when the hapless\r\nLesley first beheld her at Drummond-house. His heart which (to use\r\nyour favourite comparison) was as delicate as sweet and as tender as a\r\nWhipt-syllabub, could not resist her attractions. In a very few Days,\r\nhe was falling in love, shortly after actually fell, and before he had\r\nknown her a Month, he had married her. My Father was at first highly\r\ndispleased at so hasty and imprudent a connection; but when he found\r\nthat they did not mind it, he soon became perfectly reconciled to the\r\nmatch. The Estate near Aberdeen which my brother possesses by the bounty\r\nof his great Uncle independant of Sir George, was entirely sufficient\r\nto support him and my Sister in Elegance and Ease. For the first\r\ntwelvemonth, no one could be happier than Lesley, and no one more\r\namiable to appearance than Louisa, and so plausibly did she act and\r\nso cautiously behave that tho\' Matilda and I often spent several weeks\r\ntogether with them, yet we neither of us had any suspicion of her real\r\nDisposition. After the birth of Louisa however, which one would have\r\nthought would have strengthened her regard for Lesley, the mask she had\r\nso long supported was by degrees thrown aside, and as probably she then\r\nthought herself secure in the affection of her Husband (which did indeed\r\nappear if possible augmented by the birth of his Child) she seemed\r\nto take no pains to prevent that affection from ever diminushing. Our\r\nvisits therefore to Dunbeath, were now less frequent and by far less\r\nagreable than they used to be. Our absence was however never either\r\nmentioned or lamented by Louisa who in the society of young Danvers\r\nwith whom she became acquainted at Aberdeen (he was at one of the\r\nUniversities there,) felt infinitely happier than in that of Matilda and\r\nyour freind, tho\' there certainly never were pleasanter girls than we\r\nare. You know the sad end of all Lesleys connubial happiness; I will not\r\nrepeat it--. Adeiu my dear Charlotte; although I have not yet mentioned\r\nanything of the matter, I hope you will do me the justice to beleive\r\nthat I THINK and FEEL, a great deal for your Sisters affliction. I do\r\nnot doubt but that the healthy air of the Bristol downs will intirely\r\nremove it, by erasing from her Mind the remembrance of Henry. I am my\r\ndear Charlotte yrs ever M. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the FOURTH From Miss C. LUTTERELL to Miss M. LESLEY Bristol\r\nFebruary 27th\r\n\r\nMy Dear Peggy I have but just received your letter, which being directed\r\nto Sussex while I was at Bristol was obliged to be forwarded to me here,\r\nand from some unaccountable Delay, has but this instant reached me--.\r\nI return you many thanks for the account it contains of Lesley\'s\r\nacquaintance, Love and Marriage with Louisa, which has not the less\r\nentertained me for having often been repeated to me before.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction of informing you that we have every reason to\r\nimagine our pantry is by this time nearly cleared, as we left Particular\r\norders with the servants to eat as hard as they possibly could, and to\r\ncall in a couple of Chairwomen to assist them. We brought a cold Pigeon\r\npye, a cold turkey, a cold tongue, and half a dozen Jellies with us,\r\nwhich we were lucky enough with the help of our Landlady, her husband,\r\nand their three children, to get rid of, in less than two days after\r\nour arrival. Poor Eloisa is still so very indifferent both in Health and\r\nSpirits, that I very much fear, the air of the Bristol downs, healthy as\r\nit is, has not been able to drive poor Henry from her remembrance.\r\n\r\nYou ask me whether your new Mother in law is handsome and amiable--I\r\nwill now give you an exact description of her bodily and mental charms.\r\nShe is short, and extremely well made; is naturally pale, but rouges a\r\ngood deal; has fine eyes, and fine teeth, as she will take care to let\r\nyou know as soon as she sees you, and is altogether very pretty. She is\r\nremarkably good-tempered when she has her own way, and very lively when\r\nshe is not out of humour. She is naturally extravagant and not very\r\naffected; she never reads anything but the letters she receives from me,\r\nand never writes anything but her answers to them. She plays, sings and\r\nDances, but has no taste for either, and excells in none, tho\' she says\r\nshe is passionately fond of all. Perhaps you may flatter me so far as to\r\nbe surprised that one of whom I speak with so little affection should\r\nbe my particular freind; but to tell you the truth, our freindship arose\r\nrather from Caprice on her side than Esteem on mine. We spent two or\r\nthree days together with a Lady in Berkshire with whom we both happened\r\nto be connected--. During our visit, the Weather being remarkably bad,\r\nand our party particularly stupid, she was so good as to conceive\r\na violent partiality for me, which very soon settled in a downright\r\nFreindship and ended in an established correspondence. She is probably\r\nby this time as tired of me, as I am of her; but as she is too Polite\r\nand I am too civil to say so, our letters are still as frequent and\r\naffectionate as ever, and our Attachment as firm and sincere as when it\r\nfirst commenced. As she had a great taste for the pleasures of London,\r\nand of Brighthelmstone, she will I dare say find some difficulty in\r\nprevailing on herself even to satisfy the curiosity I dare say she feels\r\nof beholding you, at the expence of quitting those favourite haunts of\r\nDissipation, for the melancholy tho\' venerable gloom of the castle you\r\ninhabit. Perhaps however if she finds her health impaired by too much\r\namusement, she may acquire fortitude sufficient to undertake a Journey\r\nto Scotland in the hope of its Proving at least beneficial to her\r\nhealth, if not conducive to her happiness. Your fears I am sorry to say,\r\nconcerning your father\'s extravagance, your own fortunes, your Mothers\r\nJewels and your Sister\'s consequence, I should suppose are but too well\r\nfounded. My freind herself has four thousand pounds, and will probably\r\nspend nearly as much every year in Dress and Public places, if she can\r\nget it--she will certainly not endeavour to reclaim Sir George from the\r\nmanner of living to which he has been so long accustomed, and there is\r\ntherefore some reason to fear that you will be very well off, if you get\r\nany fortune at all. The Jewels I should imagine too will undoubtedly be\r\nhers, and there is too much reason to think that she will preside at\r\nher Husbands table in preference to his Daughter. But as so melancholy a\r\nsubject must necessarily extremely distress you, I will no longer dwell\r\non it--.\r\n\r\nEloisa\'s indisposition has brought us to Bristol at so unfashionable a\r\nseason of the year, that we have actually seen but one genteel family\r\nsince we came. Mr and Mrs Marlowe are very agreable people; the ill\r\nhealth of their little boy occasioned their arrival here; you may\r\nimagine that being the only family with whom we can converse, we are\r\nof course on a footing of intimacy with them; we see them indeed almost\r\nevery day, and dined with them yesterday. We spent a very pleasant\r\nDay, and had a very good Dinner, tho\' to be sure the Veal was terribly\r\nunderdone, and the Curry had no seasoning. I could not help wishing\r\nall dinner-time that I had been at the dressing it--. A brother of Mrs\r\nMarlowe, Mr Cleveland is with them at present; he is a good-looking\r\nyoung Man, and seems to have a good deal to say for himself. I tell\r\nEloisa that she should set her cap at him, but she does not at all\r\nseem to relish the proposal. I should like to see the girl married and\r\nCleveland has a very good estate. Perhaps you may wonder that I do not\r\nconsider myself as well as my Sister in my matrimonial Projects; but\r\nto tell you the truth I never wish to act a more principal part at a\r\nWedding than the superintending and directing the Dinner, and therefore\r\nwhile I can get any of my acquaintance to marry for me, I shall never\r\nthink of doing it myself, as I very much suspect that I should not have\r\nso much time for dressing my own Wedding-dinner, as for dressing that of\r\nmy freinds. Yours sincerely C. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the FIFTH Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL\r\nLesley-Castle March 18th\r\n\r\nOn the same day that I received your last kind letter, Matilda received\r\none from Sir George which was dated from Edinburgh, and informed us that\r\nhe should do himself the pleasure of introducing Lady Lesley to us on\r\nthe following evening. This as you may suppose considerably surprised\r\nus, particularly as your account of her Ladyship had given us reason to\r\nimagine there was little chance of her visiting Scotland at a time that\r\nLondon must be so gay. As it was our business however to be delighted at\r\nsuch a mark of condescension as a visit from Sir George and Lady Lesley,\r\nwe prepared to return them an answer expressive of the happiness we\r\nenjoyed in expectation of such a Blessing, when luckily recollecting\r\nthat as they were to reach the Castle the next Evening, it would be\r\nimpossible for my father to receive it before he left Edinburgh, we\r\ncontented ourselves with leaving them to suppose that we were as happy\r\nas we ought to be. At nine in the Evening on the following day,\r\nthey came, accompanied by one of Lady Lesleys brothers. Her Ladyship\r\nperfectly answers the description you sent me of her, except that I do\r\nnot think her so pretty as you seem to consider her. She has not a\r\nbad face, but there is something so extremely unmajestic in her little\r\ndiminutive figure, as to render her in comparison with the elegant\r\nheight of Matilda and Myself, an insignificant Dwarf. Her curiosity to\r\nsee us (which must have been great to bring her more than four hundred\r\nmiles) being now perfectly gratified, she already begins to mention\r\ntheir return to town, and has desired us to accompany her. We cannot\r\nrefuse her request since it is seconded by the commands of our Father,\r\nand thirded by the entreaties of Mr. Fitzgerald who is certainly one\r\nof the most pleasing young Men, I ever beheld. It is not yet determined\r\nwhen we are to go, but when ever we do we shall certainly take our\r\nlittle Louisa with us. Adeiu my dear Charlotte; Matilda unites in best\r\nwishes to you, and Eloisa, with yours ever M. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the SIXTH LADY LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL Lesley-Castle\r\nMarch 20th\r\n\r\nWe arrived here my sweet Freind about a fortnight ago, and I already\r\nheartily repent that I ever left our charming House in Portman-square\r\nfor such a dismal old weather-beaten Castle as this. You can form no\r\nidea sufficiently hideous, of its dungeon-like form. It is actually\r\nperched upon a Rock to appearance so totally inaccessible, that I\r\nexpected to have been pulled up by a rope; and sincerely repented having\r\ngratified my curiosity to behold my Daughters at the expence of being\r\nobliged to enter their prison in so dangerous and ridiculous a manner.\r\nBut as soon as I once found myself safely arrived in the inside of\r\nthis tremendous building, I comforted myself with the hope of having my\r\nspirits revived, by the sight of two beautifull girls, such as the Miss\r\nLesleys had been represented to me, at Edinburgh. But here again, I\r\nmet with nothing but Disappointment and Surprise. Matilda and Margaret\r\nLesley are two great, tall, out of the way, over-grown, girls, just of\r\na proper size to inhabit a Castle almost as large in comparison as\r\nthemselves. I wish my dear Charlotte that you could but behold these\r\nScotch giants; I am sure they would frighten you out of your wits.\r\nThey will do very well as foils to myself, so I have invited them to\r\naccompany me to London where I hope to be in the course of a fortnight.\r\nBesides these two fair Damsels, I found a little humoured Brat here who\r\nI beleive is some relation to them, they told me who she was, and gave\r\nme a long rigmerole story of her father and a Miss SOMEBODY which I have\r\nentirely forgot. I hate scandal and detest Children. I have been plagued\r\never since I came here with tiresome visits from a parcel of Scotch\r\nwretches, with terrible hard-names; they were so civil, gave me so many\r\ninvitations, and talked of coming again so soon, that I could not help\r\naffronting them. I suppose I shall not see them any more, and yet as\r\na family party we are so stupid, that I do not know what to do with\r\nmyself. These girls have no Music, but Scotch airs, no Drawings but\r\nScotch Mountains, and no Books but Scotch Poems--and I hate everything\r\nScotch. In general I can spend half the Day at my toilett with a great\r\ndeal of pleasure, but why should I dress here, since there is not a\r\ncreature in the House whom I have any wish to please. I have just had\r\na conversation with my Brother in which he has greatly offended me, and\r\nwhich as I have nothing more entertaining to send you I will gave you\r\nthe particulars of. You must know that I have for these 4 or 5 Days past\r\nstrongly suspected William of entertaining a partiality to my eldest\r\nDaughter. I own indeed that had I been inclined to fall in love with any\r\nwoman, I should not have made choice of Matilda Lesley for the object\r\nof my passion; for there is nothing I hate so much as a tall Woman: but\r\nhowever there is no accounting for some men\'s taste and as William is\r\nhimself nearly six feet high, it is not wonderful that he should be\r\npartial to that height. Now as I have a very great affection for my\r\nBrother and should be extremely sorry to see him unhappy, which I\r\nsuppose he means to be if he cannot marry Matilda, as moreover I know\r\nthat his circumstances will not allow him to marry any one without a\r\nfortune, and that Matilda\'s is entirely dependant on her Father, who\r\nwill neither have his own inclination nor my permission to give her\r\nanything at present, I thought it would be doing a good-natured action\r\nby my Brother to let him know as much, in order that he might choose\r\nfor himself, whether to conquer his passion, or Love and Despair.\r\nAccordingly finding myself this Morning alone with him in one of the\r\nhorrid old rooms of this Castle, I opened the cause to him in the\r\nfollowing Manner.\r\n\r\n"Well my dear William what do you think of these girls? for my part, I\r\ndo not find them so plain as I expected: but perhaps you may think me\r\npartial to the Daughters of my Husband and perhaps you are right--They\r\nare indeed so very like Sir George that it is natural to think"--\r\n\r\n"My Dear Susan (cried he in a tone of the greatest amazement) You do not\r\nreally think they bear the least resemblance to their Father! He is so\r\nvery plain!--but I beg your pardon--I had entirely forgotten to whom I\r\nwas speaking--"\r\n\r\n"Oh! pray dont mind me; (replied I) every one knows Sir George is\r\nhorribly ugly, and I assure you I always thought him a fright."\r\n\r\n"You surprise me extremely (answered William) by what you say both with\r\nrespect to Sir George and his Daughters. You cannot think your Husband\r\nso deficient in personal Charms as you speak of, nor can you surely see\r\nany resemblance between him and the Miss Lesleys who are in my opinion\r\nperfectly unlike him and perfectly Handsome."\r\n\r\n"If that is your opinion with regard to the girls it certainly is no\r\nproof of their Fathers beauty, for if they are perfectly unlike him and\r\nvery handsome at the same time, it is natural to suppose that he is very\r\nplain."\r\n\r\n"By no means, (said he) for what may be pretty in a Woman, may be very\r\nunpleasing in a Man."\r\n\r\n"But you yourself (replied I) but a few minutes ago allowed him to be\r\nvery plain."\r\n\r\n"Men are no Judges of Beauty in their own Sex." (said he).\r\n\r\n"Neither Men nor Women can think Sir George tolerable."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, (said he) we will not dispute about HIS Beauty, but your\r\nopinion of his DAUGHTERS is surely very singular, for if I understood\r\nyou right, you said you did not find them so plain as you expected to\r\ndo!"\r\n\r\n"Why, do YOU find them plainer then?" (said I).\r\n\r\n"I can scarcely beleive you to be serious (returned he) when you speak\r\nof their persons in so extroidinary a Manner. Do not you think the Miss\r\nLesleys are two very handsome young Women?"\r\n\r\n"Lord! No! (cried I) I think them terribly plain!"\r\n\r\n"Plain! (replied He) My dear Susan, you cannot really think so! Why\r\nwhat single Feature in the face of either of them, can you possibly find\r\nfault with?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! trust me for that; (replied I). Come I will begin with the\r\neldest--with Matilda. Shall I, William?" (I looked as cunning as I could\r\nwhen I said it, in order to shame him).\r\n\r\n"They are so much alike (said he) that I should suppose the faults of\r\none, would be the faults of both."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, in the first place; they are both so horribly tall!"\r\n\r\n"They are TALLER than you are indeed." (said he with a saucy smile.)\r\n\r\n"Nay, (said I), I know nothing of that."\r\n\r\n"Well, but (he continued) tho\' they may be above the common size, their\r\nfigures are perfectly elegant; and as to their faces, their Eyes are\r\nbeautifull."\r\n\r\n"I never can think such tremendous, knock-me-down figures in the least\r\ndegree elegant, and as for their eyes, they are so tall that I never\r\ncould strain my neck enough to look at them."\r\n\r\n"Nay, (replied he) I know not whether you may not be in the right in not\r\nattempting it, for perhaps they might dazzle you with their Lustre."\r\n\r\n"Oh! Certainly. (said I, with the greatest complacency, for I assure\r\nyou my dearest Charlotte I was not in the least offended tho\' by what\r\nfollowed, one would suppose that William was conscious of having given\r\nme just cause to be so, for coming up to me and taking my hand, he said)\r\n"You must not look so grave Susan; you will make me fear I have offended\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\n"Offended me! Dear Brother, how came such a thought in your head!\r\n(returned I) No really! I assure you that I am not in the least\r\nsurprised at your being so warm an advocate for the Beauty of these\r\ngirls."--\r\n\r\n"Well, but (interrupted William) remember that we have not yet\r\nconcluded our dispute concerning them. What fault do you find with their\r\ncomplexion?"\r\n\r\n"They are so horridly pale."\r\n\r\n"They have always a little colour, and after any exercise it is\r\nconsiderably heightened."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but if there should ever happen to be any rain in this part of\r\nthe world, they will never be able raise more than their common\r\nstock--except indeed they amuse themselves with running up and Down\r\nthese horrid old galleries and Antichambers."\r\n\r\n"Well, (replied my Brother in a tone of vexation, and glancing an\r\nimpertinent look at me) if they HAVE but little colour, at least, it is\r\nall their own."\r\n\r\nThis was too much my dear Charlotte, for I am certain that he had the\r\nimpudence by that look, of pretending to suspect the reality of mine.\r\nBut you I am sure will vindicate my character whenever you may hear\r\nit so cruelly aspersed, for you can witness how often I have protested\r\nagainst wearing Rouge, and how much I always told you I disliked it. And\r\nI assure you that my opinions are still the same.--. Well, not bearing\r\nto be so suspected by my Brother, I left the room immediately, and have\r\nbeen ever since in my own Dressing-room writing to you. What a long\r\nletter have I made of it! But you must not expect to receive such from\r\nme when I get to Town; for it is only at Lesley castle, that one has\r\ntime to write even to a Charlotte Lutterell.--. I was so much vexed by\r\nWilliam\'s glance, that I could not summon Patience enough, to stay and\r\ngive him that advice respecting his attachment to Matilda which had\r\nfirst induced me from pure Love to him to begin the conversation; and\r\nI am now so thoroughly convinced by it, of his violent passion for her,\r\nthat I am certain he would never hear reason on the subject, and I\r\nshall there fore give myself no more trouble either about him or his\r\nfavourite. Adeiu my dear girl--Yrs affectionately Susan L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the SEVENTH From Miss C. LUTTERELL to Miss M. LESLEY Bristol the\r\n27th of March\r\n\r\nI have received Letters from you and your Mother-in-law within this week\r\nwhich have greatly entertained me, as I find by them that you are both\r\ndownright jealous of each others Beauty. It is very odd that two pretty\r\nWomen tho\' actually Mother and Daughter cannot be in the same House\r\nwithout falling out about their faces. Do be convinced that you are both\r\nperfectly handsome and say no more of the Matter. I suppose this letter\r\nmust be directed to Portman Square where probably (great as is your\r\naffection for Lesley Castle) you will not be sorry to find yourself. In\r\nspite of all that people may say about Green fields and the Country\r\nI was always of opinion that London and its amusements must be very\r\nagreable for a while, and should be very happy could my Mother\'s income\r\nallow her to jockey us into its Public-places, during Winter. I always\r\nlonged particularly to go to Vaux-hall, to see whether the cold Beef\r\nthere is cut so thin as it is reported, for I have a sly suspicion that\r\nfew people understand the art of cutting a slice of cold Beef so well\r\nas I do: nay it would be hard if I did not know something of the Matter,\r\nfor it was a part of my Education that I took by far the most pains\r\nwith. Mama always found me HER best scholar, tho\' when Papa was\r\nalive Eloisa was HIS. Never to be sure were there two more different\r\nDispositions in the World. We both loved Reading. SHE preferred\r\nHistories, and I Receipts. She loved drawing, Pictures, and I drawing\r\nPullets. No one could sing a better song than she, and no one make a\r\nbetter Pye than I.--And so it has always continued since we have been\r\nno longer children. The only difference is that all disputes on the\r\nsuperior excellence of our Employments THEN so frequent are now no more.\r\nWe have for many years entered into an agreement always to admire\r\neach other\'s works; I never fail listening to HER Music, and she is as\r\nconstant in eating my pies. Such at least was the case till Henry Hervey\r\nmade his appearance in Sussex. Before the arrival of his Aunt in our\r\nneighbourhood where she established herself you know about a twelvemonth\r\nago, his visits to her had been at stated times, and of equal and\r\nsettled Duration; but on her removal to the Hall which is within a walk\r\nfrom our House, they became both more frequent and longer. This as you\r\nmay suppose could not be pleasing to Mrs Diana who is a professed enemy\r\nto everything which is not directed by Decorum and Formality, or which\r\nbears the least resemblance to Ease and Good-breeding. Nay so great was\r\nher aversion to her Nephews behaviour that I have often heard her give\r\nsuch hints of it before his face that had not Henry at such times been\r\nengaged in conversation with Eloisa, they must have caught his Attention\r\nand have very much distressed him. The alteration in my Sisters\r\nbehaviour which I have before hinted at, now took place. The Agreement\r\nwe had entered into of admiring each others productions she no\r\nlonger seemed to regard, and tho\' I constantly applauded even every\r\nCountry-dance, she played, yet not even a pidgeon-pye of my making could\r\nobtain from her a single word of approbation. This was certainly enough\r\nto put any one in a Passion; however, I was as cool as a cream-cheese\r\nand having formed my plan and concerted a scheme of Revenge, I was\r\ndetermined to let her have her own way and not even to make her a single\r\nreproach. My scheme was to treat her as she treated me, and tho\' she\r\nmight even draw my own Picture or play Malbrook (which is the only tune\r\nI ever really liked) not to say so much as "Thank you Eloisa;" tho\'\r\nI had for many years constantly hollowed whenever she played, BRAVO,\r\nBRAVISSIMO, ENCORE, DA CAPO, ALLEGRETTO, CON EXPRESSIONE, and POCO\r\nPRESTO with many other such outlandish words, all of them as Eloisa told\r\nme expressive of my Admiration; and so indeed I suppose they are, as I\r\nsee some of them in every Page of every Music book, being the sentiments\r\nI imagine of the composer.\r\n\r\nI executed my Plan with great Punctuality. I can not say success, for\r\nalas! my silence while she played seemed not in the least to displease\r\nher; on the contrary she actually said to me one day "Well Charlotte,\r\nI am very glad to find that you have at last left off that ridiculous\r\ncustom of applauding my Execution on the Harpsichord till you made\r\nmy head ake, and yourself hoarse. I feel very much obliged to you for\r\nkeeping your admiration to yourself." I never shall forget the very\r\nwitty answer I made to this speech. "Eloisa (said I) I beg you would\r\nbe quite at your Ease with respect to all such fears in future, for\r\nbe assured that I shall always keep my admiration to myself and my own\r\npursuits and never extend it to yours." This was the only very severe\r\nthing I ever said in my Life; not but that I have often felt myself\r\nextremely satirical but it was the only time I ever made my feelings\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nI suppose there never were two Young people who had a greater affection\r\nfor each other than Henry and Eloisa; no, the Love of your Brother for\r\nMiss Burton could not be so strong tho\' it might be more violent. You\r\nmay imagine therefore how provoked my Sister must have been to have\r\nhim play her such a trick. Poor girl! she still laments his Death with\r\nundiminished constancy, notwithstanding he has been dead more than six\r\nweeks; but some People mind such things more than others. The ill state\r\nof Health into which his loss has thrown her makes her so weak, and so\r\nunable to support the least exertion, that she has been in tears all\r\nthis Morning merely from having taken leave of Mrs. Marlowe who with her\r\nHusband, Brother and Child are to leave Bristol this morning. I am sorry\r\nto have them go because they are the only family with whom we have here\r\nany acquaintance, but I never thought of crying; to be sure Eloisa\r\nand Mrs Marlowe have always been more together than with me, and have\r\ntherefore contracted a kind of affection for each other, which does not\r\nmake Tears so inexcusable in them as they would be in me. The Marlowes\r\nare going to Town; Cliveland accompanies them; as neither Eloisa nor I\r\ncould catch him I hope you or Matilda may have better Luck. I know not\r\nwhen we shall leave Bristol, Eloisa\'s spirits are so low that she is\r\nvery averse to moving, and yet is certainly by no means mended by her\r\nresidence here. A week or two will I hope determine our Measures--in the\r\nmean time believe me and etc--and etc--Charlotte Lutterell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the EIGHTH Miss LUTTERELL to Mrs MARLOWE Bristol April 4th\r\n\r\nI feel myself greatly obliged to you my dear Emma for such a mark of\r\nyour affection as I flatter myself was conveyed in the proposal you made\r\nme of our Corresponding; I assure you that it will be a great releif to\r\nme to write to you and as long as my Health and Spirits will allow\r\nme, you will find me a very constant correspondent; I will not say\r\nan entertaining one, for you know my situation suffciently not to be\r\nignorant that in me Mirth would be improper and I know my own Heart too\r\nwell not to be sensible that it would be unnatural. You must not expect\r\nnews for we see no one with whom we are in the least acquainted, or in\r\nwhose proceedings we have any Interest. You must not expect scandal\r\nfor by the same rule we are equally debarred either from hearing or\r\ninventing it.--You must expect from me nothing but the melancholy\r\neffusions of a broken Heart which is ever reverting to the Happiness\r\nit once enjoyed and which ill supports its present wretchedness. The\r\nPossibility of being able to write, to speak, to you of my lost Henry\r\nwill be a luxury to me, and your goodness will not I know refuse to read\r\nwhat it will so much releive my Heart to write. I once thought that to\r\nhave what is in general called a Freind (I mean one of my own sex\r\nto whom I might speak with less reserve than to any other person)\r\nindependant of my sister would never be an object of my wishes, but how\r\nmuch was I mistaken! Charlotte is too much engrossed by two confidential\r\ncorrespondents of that sort, to supply the place of one to me, and I\r\nhope you will not think me girlishly romantic, when I say that to\r\nhave some kind and compassionate Freind who might listen to my sorrows\r\nwithout endeavouring to console me was what I had for some time wished\r\nfor, when our acquaintance with you, the intimacy which followed it and\r\nthe particular affectionate attention you paid me almost from the first,\r\ncaused me to entertain the flattering Idea of those attentions being\r\nimproved on a closer acquaintance into a Freindship which, if you were\r\nwhat my wishes formed you would be the greatest Happiness I could\r\nbe capable of enjoying. To find that such Hopes are realised is a\r\nsatisfaction indeed, a satisfaction which is now almost the only one I\r\ncan ever experience.--I feel myself so languid that I am sure were you\r\nwith me you would oblige me to leave off writing, and I cannot give you\r\na greater proof of my affection for you than by acting, as I know you\r\nwould wish me to do, whether Absent or Present. I am my dear Emmas\r\nsincere freind E. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the NINTH Mrs MARLOWE to Miss LUTTERELL Grosvenor Street, April\r\n10th\r\n\r\nNeed I say my dear Eloisa how wellcome your letter was to me I cannot\r\ngive a greater proof of the pleasure I received from it, or of the\r\nDesire I feel that our Correspondence may be regular and frequent than\r\nby setting you so good an example as I now do in answering it before the\r\nend of the week--. But do not imagine that I claim any merit in being\r\nso punctual; on the contrary I assure you, that it is a far greater\r\nGratification to me to write to you, than to spend the Evening either at\r\na Concert or a Ball. Mr Marlowe is so desirous of my appearing at some\r\nof the Public places every evening that I do not like to refuse him, but\r\nat the same time so much wish to remain at Home, that independant of\r\nthe Pleasure I experience in devoting any portion of my Time to my\r\nDear Eloisa, yet the Liberty I claim from having a letter to write of\r\nspending an Evening at home with my little Boy, you know me well enough\r\nto be sensible, will of itself be a sufficient Inducement (if one is\r\nnecessary) to my maintaining with Pleasure a Correspondence with you.\r\nAs to the subject of your letters to me, whether grave or merry, if they\r\nconcern you they must be equally interesting to me; not but that I think\r\nthe melancholy Indulgence of your own sorrows by repeating them and\r\ndwelling on them to me, will only encourage and increase them, and\r\nthat it will be more prudent in you to avoid so sad a subject; but yet\r\nknowing as I do what a soothing and melancholy Pleasure it must afford\r\nyou, I cannot prevail on myself to deny you so great an Indulgence, and\r\nwill only insist on your not expecting me to encourage you in it, by my\r\nown letters; on the contrary I intend to fill them with such lively Wit\r\nand enlivening Humour as shall even provoke a smile in the sweet but\r\nsorrowfull countenance of my Eloisa.\r\n\r\nIn the first place you are to learn that I have met your sisters three\r\nfreinds Lady Lesley and her Daughters, twice in Public since I have been\r\nhere. I know you will be impatient to hear my opinion of the Beauty of\r\nthree Ladies of whom you have heard so much. Now, as you are too ill and\r\ntoo unhappy to be vain, I think I may venture to inform you that I\r\nlike none of their faces so well as I do your own. Yet they are all\r\nhandsome--Lady Lesley indeed I have seen before; her Daughters I beleive\r\nwould in general be said to have a finer face than her Ladyship, and yet\r\nwhat with the charms of a Blooming complexion, a little Affectation and\r\na great deal of small-talk, (in each of which she is superior to the\r\nyoung Ladies) she will I dare say gain herself as many admirers as the\r\nmore regular features of Matilda, and Margaret. I am sure you will agree\r\nwith me in saying that they can none of them be of a proper size for\r\nreal Beauty, when you know that two of them are taller and the other\r\nshorter than ourselves. In spite of this Defect (or rather by reason\r\nof it) there is something very noble and majestic in the figures of the\r\nMiss Lesleys, and something agreably lively in the appearance of their\r\npretty little Mother-in-law. But tho\' one may be majestic and the other\r\nlively, yet the faces of neither possess that Bewitching sweetness of\r\nmy Eloisas, which her present languor is so far from diminushing. What\r\nwould my Husband and Brother say of us, if they knew all the fine things\r\nI have been saying to you in this letter. It is very hard that a pretty\r\nwoman is never to be told she is so by any one of her own sex without\r\nthat person\'s being suspected to be either her determined Enemy, or\r\nher professed Toad-eater. How much more amiable are women in that\r\nparticular! One man may say forty civil things to another without our\r\nsupposing that he is ever paid for it, and provided he does his Duty by\r\nour sex, we care not how Polite he is to his own.\r\n\r\nMrs Lutterell will be so good as to accept my compliments, Charlotte,\r\nmy Love, and Eloisa the best wishes for the recovery of her Health and\r\nSpirits that can be offered by her affectionate Freind E. Marlowe.\r\n\r\nI am afraid this letter will be but a poor specimen of my Powers in the\r\nwitty way; and your opinion of them will not be greatly increased when I\r\nassure you that I have been as entertaining as I possibly could.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the TENTH From Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL\r\nPortman Square April 13th\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CHARLOTTE We left Lesley-Castle on the 28th of last Month,\r\nand arrived safely in London after a Journey of seven Days; I had the\r\npleasure of finding your Letter here waiting my Arrival, for which you\r\nhave my grateful Thanks. Ah! my dear Freind I every day more regret the\r\nserene and tranquil Pleasures of the Castle we have left, in exchange\r\nfor the uncertain and unequal Amusements of this vaunted City. Not that\r\nI will pretend to assert that these uncertain and unequal Amusements\r\nare in the least Degree unpleasing to me; on the contrary I enjoy them\r\nextremely and should enjoy them even more, were I not certain that every\r\nappearance I make in Public but rivetts the Chains of those unhappy\r\nBeings whose Passion it is impossible not to pity, tho\' it is out of my\r\npower to return. In short my Dear Charlotte it is my sensibility for\r\nthe sufferings of so many amiable young Men, my Dislike of the extreme\r\nadmiration I meet with, and my aversion to being so celebrated both in\r\nPublic, in Private, in Papers, and in Printshops, that are the reasons\r\nwhy I cannot more fully enjoy, the Amusements so various and pleasing\r\nof London. How often have I wished that I possessed as little Personal\r\nBeauty as you do; that my figure were as inelegant; my face as unlovely;\r\nand my appearance as unpleasing as yours! But ah! what little chance\r\nis there of so desirable an Event; I have had the small-pox, and must\r\ntherefore submit to my unhappy fate.\r\n\r\nI am now going to intrust you my dear Charlotte with a secret which has\r\nlong disturbed the tranquility of my days, and which is of a kind to\r\nrequire the most inviolable Secrecy from you. Last Monday se\'night\r\nMatilda and I accompanied Lady Lesley to a Rout at the Honourable Mrs\r\nKickabout\'s; we were escorted by Mr Fitzgerald who is a very amiable\r\nyoung Man in the main, tho\' perhaps a little singular in his Taste--He\r\nis in love with Matilda--. We had scarcely paid our Compliments to the\r\nLady of the House and curtseyed to half a score different people when my\r\nAttention was attracted by the appearance of a Young Man the most lovely\r\nof his Sex, who at that moment entered the Room with another Gentleman\r\nand Lady. From the first moment I beheld him, I was certain that on him\r\ndepended the future Happiness of my Life. Imagine my surprise when he\r\nwas introduced to me by the name of Cleveland--I instantly recognised\r\nhim as the Brother of Mrs Marlowe, and the acquaintance of my Charlotte\r\nat Bristol. Mr and Mrs M. were the gentleman and Lady who accompanied\r\nhim. (You do not think Mrs Marlowe handsome?) The elegant address of Mr\r\nCleveland, his polished Manners and Delightful Bow, at once confirmed my\r\nattachment. He did not speak; but I can imagine everything he would have\r\nsaid, had he opened his Mouth. I can picture to myself the cultivated\r\nUnderstanding, the Noble sentiments, and elegant Language which would\r\nhave shone so conspicuous in the conversation of Mr Cleveland. The\r\napproach of Sir James Gower (one of my too numerous admirers) prevented\r\nthe Discovery of any such Powers, by putting an end to a Conversation we\r\nhad never commenced, and by attracting my attention to himself. But oh!\r\nhow inferior are the accomplishments of Sir James to those of his so\r\ngreatly envied Rival! Sir James is one of the most frequent of our\r\nVisitors, and is almost always of our Parties. We have since often met\r\nMr and Mrs Marlowe but no Cleveland--he is always engaged some where\r\nelse. Mrs Marlowe fatigues me to Death every time I see her by her\r\ntiresome Conversations about you and Eloisa. She is so stupid! I live in\r\nthe hope of seeing her irrisistable Brother to night, as we are going to\r\nLady Flambeaus, who is I know intimate with the Marlowes. Our party will\r\nbe Lady Lesley, Matilda, Fitzgerald, Sir James Gower, and myself. We see\r\nlittle of Sir George, who is almost always at the gaming-table. Ah! my\r\npoor Fortune where art thou by this time? We see more of Lady L. who\r\nalways makes her appearance (highly rouged) at Dinner-time. Alas! what\r\nDelightful Jewels will she be decked in this evening at Lady Flambeau\'s!\r\nYet I wonder how she can herself delight in wearing them; surely she\r\nmust be sensible of the ridiculous impropriety of loading her little\r\ndiminutive figure with such superfluous ornaments; is it possible that\r\nshe can not know how greatly superior an elegant simplicity is to the\r\nmost studied apparel? Would she but Present them to Matilda and me, how\r\ngreatly should we be obliged to her, How becoming would Diamonds be on\r\nour fine majestic figures! And how surprising it is that such an Idea\r\nshould never have occurred to HER. I am sure if I have reflected in this\r\nmanner once, I have fifty times. Whenever I see Lady Lesley dressed in\r\nthem such reflections immediately come across me. My own Mother\'s Jewels\r\ntoo! But I will say no more on so melancholy a subject--let me entertain\r\nyou with something more pleasing--Matilda had a letter this morning from\r\nLesley, by which we have the pleasure of finding that he is at Naples\r\nhas turned Roman-Catholic, obtained one of the Pope\'s Bulls for\r\nannulling his 1st Marriage and has since actually married a Neapolitan\r\nLady of great Rank and Fortune. He tells us moreover that much the same\r\nsort of affair has befallen his first wife the worthless Louisa who is\r\nlikewise at Naples had turned Roman-catholic, and is soon to be married\r\nto a Neapolitan Nobleman of great and Distinguished merit. He says,\r\nthat they are at present very good Freinds, have quite forgiven all\r\npast errors and intend in future to be very good Neighbours. He invites\r\nMatilda and me to pay him a visit to Italy and to bring him his little\r\nLouisa whom both her Mother, Step-mother, and himself are equally\r\ndesirous of beholding. As to our accepting his invitation, it is at\r\nPresent very uncertain; Lady Lesley advises us to go without loss of\r\ntime; Fitzgerald offers to escort us there, but Matilda has some doubts\r\nof the Propriety of such a scheme--she owns it would be very agreable.\r\nI am certain she likes the Fellow. My Father desires us not to be in a\r\nhurry, as perhaps if we wait a few months both he and Lady Lesley will\r\ndo themselves the pleasure of attending us. Lady Lesley says no, that\r\nnothing will ever tempt her to forego the Amusements of Brighthelmstone\r\nfor a Journey to Italy merely to see our Brother. "No (says the\r\ndisagreable Woman) I have once in my life been fool enough to travel I\r\ndont know how many hundred Miles to see two of the Family, and I found\r\nit did not answer, so Deuce take me, if ever I am so foolish again."So\r\nsays her Ladyship, but Sir George still Perseveres in saying that\r\nperhaps in a month or two, they may accompany us. Adeiu my Dear\r\nCharlotte Yrs faithful Margaret Lesley.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\nFROM THE REIGN OF HENRY THE 4TH TO THE DEATH OF CHARLES THE 1ST\r\n\r\nBY A PARTIAL, PREJUDICED, AND IGNORANT HISTORIAN.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nTo Miss Austen, eldest daughter of the Rev. George Austen, this work is\r\ninscribed with all due respect by THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nN.B. There will be very few Dates in this History.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY the 4th\r\n\r\nHenry the 4th ascended the throne of England much to his own\r\nsatisfaction in the year 1399, after having prevailed on his cousin and\r\npredecessor Richard the 2nd, to resign it to him, and to retire for the\r\nrest of his life to Pomfret Castle, where he happened to be murdered.\r\nIt is to be supposed that Henry was married, since he had certainly four\r\nsons, but it is not in my power to inform the Reader who was his wife.\r\nBe this as it may, he did not live for ever, but falling ill, his son\r\nthe Prince of Wales came and took away the crown; whereupon the King\r\nmade a long speech, for which I must refer the Reader to Shakespear\'s\r\nPlays, and the Prince made a still longer. Things being thus settled\r\nbetween them the King died, and was succeeded by his son Henry who had\r\npreviously beat Sir William Gascoigne.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY the 5th\r\n\r\nThis Prince after he succeeded to the throne grew quite reformed and\r\namiable, forsaking all his dissipated companions, and never thrashing\r\nSir William again. During his reign, Lord Cobham was burnt alive, but I\r\nforget what for. His Majesty then turned his thoughts to France, where\r\nhe went and fought the famous Battle of Agincourt. He afterwards married\r\nthe King\'s daughter Catherine, a very agreable woman by Shakespear\'s\r\naccount. In spite of all this however he died, and was succeeded by his\r\nson Henry.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY the 6th\r\n\r\nI cannot say much for this Monarch\'s sense. Nor would I if I could, for\r\nhe was a Lancastrian. I suppose you know all about the Wars between him\r\nand the Duke of York who was of the right side; if you do not, you had\r\nbetter read some other History, for I shall not be very diffuse in this,\r\nmeaning by it only to vent my spleen AGAINST, and shew my Hatred TO all\r\nthose people whose parties or principles do not suit with mine, and not\r\nto give information. This King married Margaret of Anjou, a Woman whose\r\ndistresses and misfortunes were so great as almost to make me who hate\r\nher, pity her. It was in this reign that Joan of Arc lived and made such\r\na ROW among the English. They should not have burnt her--but they did.\r\nThere were several Battles between the Yorkists and Lancastrians, in\r\nwhich the former (as they ought) usually conquered. At length they were\r\nentirely overcome; The King was murdered--The Queen was sent home--and\r\nEdward the 4th ascended the Throne.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD the 4th\r\n\r\nThis Monarch was famous only for his Beauty and his Courage, of which\r\nthe Picture we have here given of him, and his undaunted Behaviour\r\nin marrying one Woman while he was engaged to another, are sufficient\r\nproofs. His Wife was Elizabeth Woodville, a Widow who, poor Woman! was\r\nafterwards confined in a Convent by that Monster of Iniquity and Avarice\r\nHenry the 7th. One of Edward\'s Mistresses was Jane Shore, who has had\r\na play written about her, but it is a tragedy and therefore not worth\r\nreading. Having performed all these noble actions, his Majesty died, and\r\nwas succeeded by his son.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD the 5th\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate Prince lived so little a while that nobody had him to\r\ndraw his picture. He was murdered by his Uncle\'s Contrivance, whose name\r\nwas Richard the 3rd.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD the 3rd\r\n\r\nThe Character of this Prince has been in general very severely treated\r\nby Historians, but as he was a YORK, I am rather inclined to suppose him\r\na very respectable Man. It has indeed been confidently asserted that he\r\nkilled his two Nephews and his Wife, but it has also been declared that\r\nhe did not kill his two Nephews, which I am inclined to beleive true;\r\nand if this is the case, it may also be affirmed that he did not kill\r\nhis Wife, for if Perkin Warbeck was really the Duke of York, why might\r\nnot Lambert Simnel be the Widow of Richard. Whether innocent or guilty,\r\nhe did not reign long in peace, for Henry Tudor E. of Richmond as great\r\na villain as ever lived, made a great fuss about getting the Crown and\r\nhaving killed the King at the battle of Bosworth, he succeeded to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY the 7th\r\n\r\nThis Monarch soon after his accession married the Princess Elizabeth of\r\nYork, by which alliance he plainly proved that he thought his own right\r\ninferior to hers, tho\' he pretended to the contrary. By this Marriage he\r\nhad two sons and two daughters, the elder of which Daughters was married\r\nto the King of Scotland and had the happiness of being grandmother\r\nto one of the first Characters in the World. But of HER, I shall have\r\noccasion to speak more at large in future. The youngest, Mary, married\r\nfirst the King of France and secondly the D. of Suffolk, by whom she had\r\none daughter, afterwards the Mother of Lady Jane Grey, who tho\' inferior\r\nto her lovely Cousin the Queen of Scots, was yet an amiable young woman\r\nand famous for reading Greek while other people were hunting. It was in\r\nthe reign of Henry the 7th that Perkin Warbeck and Lambert Simnel before\r\nmentioned made their appearance, the former of whom was set in the\r\nstocks, took shelter in Beaulieu Abbey, and was beheaded with the Earl\r\nof Warwick, and the latter was taken into the Kings kitchen. His Majesty\r\ndied and was succeeded by his son Henry whose only merit was his not\r\nbeing quite so bad as his daughter Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY the 8th\r\n\r\nIt would be an affront to my Readers were I to suppose that they were\r\nnot as well acquainted with the particulars of this King\'s reign as I am\r\nmyself. It will therefore be saving THEM the task of reading again what\r\nthey have read before, and MYSELF the trouble of writing what I do not\r\nperfectly recollect, by giving only a slight sketch of the principal\r\nEvents which marked his reign. Among these may be ranked Cardinal\r\nWolsey\'s telling the father Abbott of Leicester Abbey that "he was come\r\nto lay his bones among them," the reformation in Religion and the King\'s\r\nriding through the streets of London with Anna Bullen. It is however\r\nbut Justice, and my Duty to declare that this amiable Woman was entirely\r\ninnocent of the Crimes with which she was accused, and of which her\r\nBeauty, her Elegance, and her Sprightliness were sufficient proofs, not\r\nto mention her solemn Protestations of Innocence, the weakness of the\r\nCharges against her, and the King\'s Character; all of which add some\r\nconfirmation, tho\' perhaps but slight ones when in comparison with those\r\nbefore alledged in her favour. Tho\' I do not profess giving many dates,\r\nyet as I think it proper to give some and shall of course make choice\r\nof those which it is most necessary for the Reader to know, I think it\r\nright to inform him that her letter to the King was dated on the 6th of\r\nMay. The Crimes and Cruelties of this Prince, were too numerous to be\r\nmentioned, (as this history I trust has fully shown;) and nothing can\r\nbe said in his vindication, but that his abolishing Religious Houses and\r\nleaving them to the ruinous depredations of time has been of infinite\r\nuse to the landscape of England in general, which probably was a\r\nprincipal motive for his doing it, since otherwise why should a Man who\r\nwas of no Religion himself be at so much trouble to abolish one which\r\nhad for ages been established in the Kingdom. His Majesty\'s 5th Wife\r\nwas the Duke of Norfolk\'s Neice who, tho\' universally acquitted of the\r\ncrimes for which she was beheaded, has been by many people supposed to\r\nhave led an abandoned life before her Marriage--of this however I have\r\nmany doubts, since she was a relation of that noble Duke of Norfolk who\r\nwas so warm in the Queen of Scotland\'s cause, and who at last fell a\r\nvictim to it. The Kings last wife contrived to survive him, but with\r\ndifficulty effected it. He was succeeded by his only son Edward.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD the 6th\r\n\r\nAs this prince was only nine years old at the time of his Father\'s\r\ndeath, he was considered by many people as too young to govern, and the\r\nlate King happening to be of the same opinion, his mother\'s Brother the\r\nDuke of Somerset was chosen Protector of the realm during his minority.\r\nThis Man was on the whole of a very amiable Character, and is somewhat\r\nof a favourite with me, tho\' I would by no means pretend to affirm that\r\nhe was equal to those first of Men Robert Earl of Essex, Delamere, or\r\nGilpin. He was beheaded, of which he might with reason have been proud,\r\nhad he known that such was the death of Mary Queen of Scotland; but\r\nas it was impossible that he should be conscious of what had never\r\nhappened, it does not appear that he felt particularly delighted with\r\nthe manner of it. After his decease the Duke of Northumberland had the\r\ncare of the King and the Kingdom, and performed his trust of both so\r\nwell that the King died and the Kingdom was left to his daughter in law\r\nthe Lady Jane Grey, who has been already mentioned as reading Greek.\r\nWhether she really understood that language or whether such a study\r\nproceeded only from an excess of vanity for which I beleive she was\r\nalways rather remarkable, is uncertain. Whatever might be the cause,\r\nshe preserved the same appearance of knowledge, and contempt of what\r\nwas generally esteemed pleasure, during the whole of her life, for\r\nshe declared herself displeased with being appointed Queen, and while\r\nconducting to the scaffold, she wrote a sentence in Latin and another in\r\nGreek on seeing the dead Body of her Husband accidentally passing that\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY\r\n\r\nThis woman had the good luck of being advanced to the throne of England,\r\nin spite of the superior pretensions, Merit, and Beauty of her Cousins\r\nMary Queen of Scotland and Jane Grey. Nor can I pity the Kingdom for the\r\nmisfortunes they experienced during her Reign, since they fully deserved\r\nthem, for having allowed her to succeed her Brother--which was a double\r\npeice of folly, since they might have foreseen that as she died without\r\nchildren, she would be succeeded by that disgrace to humanity, that\r\npest of society, Elizabeth. Many were the people who fell martyrs to the\r\nprotestant Religion during her reign; I suppose not fewer than a dozen.\r\nShe married Philip King of Spain who in her sister\'s reign was famous\r\nfor building Armadas. She died without issue, and then the dreadful\r\nmoment came in which the destroyer of all comfort, the deceitful\r\nBetrayer of trust reposed in her, and the Murderess of her Cousin\r\nsucceeded to the Throne.----\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH\r\n\r\nIt was the peculiar misfortune of this Woman to have bad\r\nMinisters---Since wicked as she herself was, she could not have\r\ncommitted such extensive mischeif, had not these vile and abandoned Men\r\nconnived at, and encouraged her in her Crimes. I know that it has by\r\nmany people been asserted and beleived that Lord Burleigh, Sir Francis\r\nWalsingham, and the rest of those who filled the cheif offices of State\r\nwere deserving, experienced, and able Ministers. But oh! how blinded\r\nsuch writers and such Readers must be to true Merit, to Merit despised,\r\nneglected and defamed, if they can persist in such opinions when they\r\nreflect that these men, these boasted men were such scandals to their\r\nCountry and their sex as to allow and assist their Queen in confining\r\nfor the space of nineteen years, a WOMAN who if the claims of\r\nRelationship and Merit were of no avail, yet as a Queen and as one who\r\ncondescended to place confidence in her, had every reason to expect\r\nassistance and protection; and at length in allowing Elizabeth to bring\r\nthis amiable Woman to an untimely, unmerited, and scandalous Death. Can\r\nany one if he reflects but for a moment on this blot, this everlasting\r\nblot upon their understanding and their Character, allow any praise to\r\nLord Burleigh or Sir Francis Walsingham? Oh! what must this bewitching\r\nPrincess whose only freind was then the Duke of Norfolk, and whose\r\nonly ones now Mr Whitaker, Mrs Lefroy, Mrs Knight and myself, who was\r\nabandoned by her son, confined by her Cousin, abused, reproached and\r\nvilified by all, what must not her most noble mind have suffered when\r\ninformed that Elizabeth had given orders for her Death! Yet she bore\r\nit with a most unshaken fortitude, firm in her mind; constant in her\r\nReligion; and prepared herself to meet the cruel fate to which she\r\nwas doomed, with a magnanimity that would alone proceed from conscious\r\nInnocence. And yet could you Reader have beleived it possible that\r\nsome hardened and zealous Protestants have even abused her for that\r\nsteadfastness in the Catholic Religion which reflected on her so\r\nmuch credit? But this is a striking proof of THEIR narrow souls and\r\nprejudiced Judgements who accuse her. She was executed in the Great Hall\r\nat Fortheringay Castle (sacred Place!) on Wednesday the 8th of February\r\n1586--to the everlasting Reproach of Elizabeth, her Ministers, and of\r\nEngland in general. It may not be unnecessary before I entirely conclude\r\nmy account of this ill-fated Queen, to observe that she had been accused\r\nof several crimes during the time of her reigning in Scotland, of which\r\nI now most seriously do assure my Reader that she was entirely innocent;\r\nhaving never been guilty of anything more than Imprudencies into which\r\nshe was betrayed by the openness of her Heart, her Youth, and her\r\nEducation. Having I trust by this assurance entirely done away every\r\nSuspicion and every doubt which might have arisen in the Reader\'s mind,\r\nfrom what other Historians have written of her, I shall proceed to\r\nmention the remaining Events that marked Elizabeth\'s reign. It was about\r\nthis time that Sir Francis Drake the first English Navigator who sailed\r\nround the World, lived, to be the ornament of his Country and his\r\nprofession. Yet great as he was, and justly celebrated as a sailor,\r\nI cannot help foreseeing that he will be equalled in this or the next\r\nCentury by one who tho\' now but young, already promises to answer all\r\nthe ardent and sanguine expectations of his Relations and Freinds,\r\namongst whom I may class the amiable Lady to whom this work is\r\ndedicated, and my no less amiable self.\r\n\r\nThough of a different profession, and shining in a different sphere of\r\nLife, yet equally conspicuous in the Character of an Earl, as Drake was\r\nin that of a Sailor, was Robert Devereux Lord Essex. This unfortunate\r\nyoung Man was not unlike in character to that equally unfortunate\r\none FREDERIC DELAMERE. The simile may be carried still farther, and\r\nElizabeth the torment of Essex may be compared to the Emmeline of\r\nDelamere. It would be endless to recount the misfortunes of this noble\r\nand gallant Earl. It is sufficient to say that he was beheaded on the\r\n25th of Feb, after having been Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, after having\r\nclapped his hand on his sword, and after performing many other services\r\nto his Country. Elizabeth did not long survive his loss, and died so\r\nmiserable that were it not an injury to the memory of Mary I should pity\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES the 1st\r\n\r\nThough this King had some faults, among which and as the most principal,\r\nwas his allowing his Mother\'s death, yet considered on the whole I\r\ncannot help liking him. He married Anne of Denmark, and had several\r\nChildren; fortunately for him his eldest son Prince Henry died before\r\nhis father or he might have experienced the evils which befell his\r\nunfortunate Brother.\r\n\r\nAs I am myself partial to the roman catholic religion, it is with\r\ninfinite regret that I am obliged to blame the Behaviour of any Member\r\nof it: yet Truth being I think very excusable in an Historian, I am\r\nnecessitated to say that in this reign the roman Catholics of England\r\ndid not behave like Gentlemen to the protestants. Their Behaviour\r\nindeed to the Royal Family and both Houses of Parliament might justly\r\nbe considered by them as very uncivil, and even Sir Henry Percy tho\'\r\ncertainly the best bred man of the party, had none of that general\r\npoliteness which is so universally pleasing, as his attentions were\r\nentirely confined to Lord Mounteagle.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh flourished in this and the preceeding reign, and is\r\nby many people held in great veneration and respect--But as he was an\r\nenemy of the noble Essex, I have nothing to say in praise of him, and\r\nmust refer all those who may wish to be acquainted with the particulars\r\nof his life, to Mr Sheridan\'s play of the Critic, where they will\r\nfind many interesting anecdotes as well of him as of his friend Sir\r\nChristopher Hatton.--His Majesty was of that amiable disposition which\r\ninclines to Freindship, and in such points was possessed of a keener\r\npenetration in discovering Merit than many other people. I once heard an\r\nexcellent Sharade on a Carpet, of which the subject I am now on reminds\r\nme, and as I think it may afford my Readers some amusement to FIND IT\r\nOUT, I shall here take the liberty of presenting it to them.\r\n\r\nSHARADE My first is what my second was to King James the 1st, and you\r\ntread on my whole.\r\n\r\nThe principal favourites of his Majesty were Car, who was afterwards\r\ncreated Earl of Somerset and whose name perhaps may have some share\r\nin the above mentioned Sharade, and George Villiers afterwards Duke of\r\nBuckingham. On his Majesty\'s death he was succeeded by his son Charles.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES the 1st\r\n\r\nThis amiable Monarch seems born to have suffered misfortunes equal to\r\nthose of his lovely Grandmother; misfortunes which he could not deserve\r\nsince he was her descendant. Never certainly were there before so many\r\ndetestable Characters at one time in England as in this Period of its\r\nHistory; never were amiable men so scarce. The number of them throughout\r\nthe whole Kingdom amounting only to FIVE, besides the inhabitants\r\nof Oxford who were always loyal to their King and faithful to his\r\ninterests. The names of this noble five who never forgot the duty of\r\nthe subject, or swerved from their attachment to his Majesty, were as\r\nfollows--The King himself, ever stedfast in his own support--Archbishop\r\nLaud, Earl of Strafford, Viscount Faulkland and Duke of Ormond, who were\r\nscarcely less strenuous or zealous in the cause. While the VILLIANS\r\nof the time would make too long a list to be written or read; I shall\r\ntherefore content myself with mentioning the leaders of the Gang.\r\nCromwell, Fairfax, Hampden, and Pym may be considered as the original\r\nCausers of all the disturbances, Distresses, and Civil Wars in which\r\nEngland for many years was embroiled. In this reign as well as in that\r\nof Elizabeth, I am obliged in spite of my attachment to the Scotch,\r\nto consider them as equally guilty with the generality of the English,\r\nsince they dared to think differently from their Sovereign, to forget\r\nthe Adoration which as STUARTS it was their Duty to pay them, to rebel\r\nagainst, dethrone and imprison the unfortunate Mary; to oppose, to\r\ndeceive, and to sell the no less unfortunate Charles. The Events of this\r\nMonarch\'s reign are too numerous for my pen, and indeed the recital\r\nof any Events (except what I make myself) is uninteresting to me; my\r\nprincipal reason for undertaking the History of England being to Prove\r\nthe innocence of the Queen of Scotland, which I flatter myself with\r\nhaving effectually done, and to abuse Elizabeth, tho\' I am rather\r\nfearful of having fallen short in the latter part of my scheme.--As\r\ntherefore it is not my intention to give any particular account of the\r\ndistresses into which this King was involved through the misconduct and\r\nCruelty of his Parliament, I shall satisfy myself with vindicating him\r\nfrom the Reproach of Arbitrary and tyrannical Government with which he\r\nhas often been charged. This, I feel, is not difficult to be done, for\r\nwith one argument I am certain of satisfying every sensible and well\r\ndisposed person whose opinions have been properly guided by a good\r\nEducation--and this Argument is that he was a STUART.\r\n\r\nFinis Saturday Nov: 26th 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COLLECTION OF LETTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Miss COOPER\r\n\r\nCOUSIN Conscious of the Charming Character which in every Country, and\r\nevery Clime in Christendom is Cried, Concerning you, with Caution and\r\nCare I Commend to your Charitable Criticism this Clever Collection\r\nof Curious Comments, which have been Carefully Culled, Collected and\r\nClassed by your Comical Cousin\r\n\r\nThe Author.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COLLECTION OF LETTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the FIRST From a MOTHER to her FREIND.\r\n\r\nMy Children begin now to claim all my attention in different Manner from\r\nthat in which they have been used to receive it, as they are now arrived\r\nat that age when it is necessary for them in some measure to become\r\nconversant with the World, My Augusta is 17 and her sister scarcely a\r\ntwelvemonth younger.

But we shall proceed by degrees.--Tomorrow Mr Stanly\'s\r\nfamily will drink tea with us, and perhaps the Miss Phillips\'s will meet\r\nthem. On Tuesday we shall pay Morning Visits--On Wednesday we are to\r\ndine at Westbrook. On Thursday we have Company at home. On Friday we\r\nare to be at a Private Concert at Sir John Wynna\'s--and on Saturday\r\nwe expect Miss Dawson to call in the Morning--which will complete my\r\nDaughters Introduction into Life. How they will bear so much dissipation\r\nI cannot imagine; of their spirits I have no fear, I only dread their\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nThis mighty affair is now happily over, and my Girls are OUT. As the\r\nmoment approached for our departure, you can have no idea how the sweet\r\nCreatures trembled with fear and expectation. Before the Carriage drove\r\nto the door, I called them into my dressing-room, and as soon as they\r\nwere seated thus addressed them. "My dear Girls the moment is now\r\narrived when I am to reap the rewards of all my Anxieties and Labours\r\ntowards you during your Education. You are this Evening to enter a World\r\nin which you will meet with many wonderfull Things; Yet let me warn\r\nyou against suffering yourselves to be meanly swayed by the Follies and\r\nVices of others, for beleive me my beloved Children that if you do--I\r\nshall be very sorry for it." They both assured me that they would ever\r\nremember my advice with Gratitude, and follow it with attention; That\r\nthey were prepared to find a World full of things to amaze and to shock\r\nthem: but that they trusted their behaviour would never give me reason\r\nto repent the Watchful Care with which I had presided over their infancy\r\nand formed their Minds--" "With such expectations and such intentions\r\n(cried I) I can have nothing to fear from you--and can chearfully\r\nconduct you to Mrs Cope\'s without a fear of your being seduced by her\r\nExample, or contaminated by her Follies. Come, then my Children (added\r\nI) the Carriage is driving to the door, and I will not a moment delay\r\nthe happiness you are so impatient to enjoy." When we arrived at\r\nWarleigh, poor Augusta could scarcely breathe, while Margaret was all\r\nLife and Rapture. "The long-expected Moment is now arrived (said she)\r\nand we shall soon be in the World."--In a few Moments we were in Mrs\r\nCope\'s parlour, where with her daughter she sate ready to receive us.\r\nI observed with delight the impression my Children made on them--. They\r\nwere indeed two sweet, elegant-looking Girls, and tho\' somewhat abashed\r\nfrom the peculiarity of their situation, yet there was an ease in their\r\nManners and address which could not fail of pleasing--. Imagine my\r\ndear Madam how delighted I must have been in beholding as I did, how\r\nattentively they observed every object they saw, how disgusted with some\r\nThings, how enchanted with others, how astonished at all! On the whole\r\nhowever they returned in raptures with the World, its Inhabitants, and\r\nManners. Yrs Ever--A. F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the SECOND From a YOUNG LADY crossed in Love to her freind\r\n\r\nWhy should this last disappointment hang so heavily on my spirits? Why\r\nshould I feel it more, why should it wound me deeper than those I\r\nhave experienced before? Can it be that I have a greater affection for\r\nWilloughby than I had for his amiable predecessors? Or is it that our\r\nfeelings become more acute from being often wounded? I must suppose my\r\ndear Belle that this is the Case, since I am not conscious of being more\r\nsincerely attached to Willoughby than I was to Neville, Fitzowen, or\r\neither of the Crawfords, for all of whom I once felt the most lasting\r\naffection that ever warmed a Woman\'s heart. Tell me then dear Belle why\r\nI still sigh when I think of the faithless Edward, or why I weep when I\r\nbehold his Bride, for too surely this is the case--. My Freinds are all\r\nalarmed for me; They fear my declining health; they lament my want\r\nof spirits; they dread the effects of both. In hopes of releiving my\r\nmelancholy, by directing my thoughts to other objects, they have invited\r\nseveral of their freinds to spend the Christmas with us. Lady Bridget\r\nDarkwood and her sister-in-law, Miss Jane are expected on Friday; and\r\nColonel Seaton\'s family will be with us next week. This is all most\r\nkindly meant by my Uncle and Cousins; but what can the presence of a\r\ndozen indefferent people do to me, but weary and distress me--. I will\r\nnot finish my Letter till some of our Visitors are arrived.\r\n\r\nFriday Evening Lady Bridget came this morning, and with her, her sweet\r\nsister Miss Jane--. Although I have been acquainted with this charming\r\nWoman above fifteen Years, yet I never before observed how lovely she\r\nis. She is now about 35, and in spite of sickness, sorrow and Time is\r\nmore blooming than I ever saw a Girl of 17. I was delighted with her,\r\nthe moment she entered the house, and she appeared equally pleased with\r\nme, attaching herself to me during the remainder of the day. There is\r\nsomething so sweet, so mild in her Countenance, that she seems more than\r\nMortal. Her Conversation is as bewitching as her appearance; I could not\r\nhelp telling her how much she engaged my admiration--. "Oh! Miss Jane\r\n(said I)--and stopped from an inability at the moment of expressing\r\nmyself as I could wish--Oh! Miss Jane--(I repeated)--I could not think\r\nof words to suit my feelings--She seemed waiting for my speech--. I\r\nwas confused--distressed--my thoughts were bewildered--and I could only\r\nadd--"How do you do?" She saw and felt for my Embarrassment and with\r\nadmirable presence of mind releived me from it by saying--"My dear\r\nSophia be not uneasy at having exposed yourself--I will turn the\r\nConversation without appearing to notice it. "Oh! how I loved her for\r\nher kindness!" Do you ride as much as you used to do?" said she--. "I\r\nam advised to ride by my Physician. We have delightful Rides round us,\r\nI have a Charming horse, am uncommonly fond of the Amusement, replied\r\nI quite recovered from my Confusion, and in short I ride a great deal."\r\n"You are in the right my Love," said she. Then repeating the following\r\nline which was an extempore and equally adapted to recommend both Riding\r\nand Candour--\r\n\r\n"Ride where you may, Be Candid where you can," she added," I rode once,\r\nbut it is many years ago--She spoke this in so low and tremulous a\r\nVoice, that I was silent--. Struck with her Manner of speaking I could\r\nmake no reply. "I have not ridden, continued she fixing her Eyes on my\r\nface, since I was married." I was never so surprised--"Married, Ma\'am!"\r\nI repeated. "You may well wear that look of astonishment, said she,\r\nsince what I have said must appear improbable to you--Yet nothing is\r\nmore true than that I once was married."\r\n\r\n"Then why are you called Miss Jane?"\r\n\r\n"I married, my Sophia without the consent or knowledge of my father the\r\nlate Admiral Annesley. It was therefore necessary to keep the secret\r\nfrom him and from every one, till some fortunate opportunity might offer\r\nof revealing it--. Such an opportunity alas! was but too soon given in\r\nthe death of my dear Capt. Dashwood--Pardon these tears, continued Miss\r\nJane wiping her Eyes, I owe them to my Husband\'s memory. He fell my\r\nSophia, while fighting for his Country in America after a most happy\r\nUnion of seven years--. My Children, two sweet Boys and a Girl, who\r\nhad constantly resided with my Father and me, passing with him and with\r\nevery one as the Children of a Brother (tho\' I had ever been an only\r\nChild) had as yet been the comforts of my Life. But no sooner had\r\nI lossed my Henry, than these sweet Creatures fell sick and died--.\r\nConceive dear Sophia what my feelings must have been when as an Aunt I\r\nattended my Children to their early Grave--. My Father did not survive\r\nthem many weeks--He died, poor Good old man, happily ignorant to his\r\nlast hour of my Marriage.\'\r\n\r\n"But did not you own it, and assume his name at your husband\'s death?"\r\n\r\n"No; I could not bring myself to do it; more especially when in my\r\nChildren I lost all inducement for doing it. Lady Bridget, and yourself\r\nare the only persons who are in the knowledge of my having ever been\r\neither Wife or Mother. As I could not Prevail on myself to take the\r\nname of Dashwood (a name which after my Henry\'s death I could never hear\r\nwithout emotion) and as I was conscious of having no right to that of\r\nAnnesley, I dropt all thoughts of either, and have made it a point of\r\nbearing only my Christian one since my Father\'s death." She paused--"Oh!\r\nmy dear Miss Jane (said I) how infinitely am I obliged to you for so\r\nentertaining a story! You cannot think how it has diverted me! But have\r\nyou quite done?"\r\n\r\n"I have only to add my dear Sophia, that my Henry\'s elder Brother dieing\r\nabout the same time, Lady Bridget became a Widow like myself, and as we\r\nhad always loved each other in idea from the high Character in which we\r\nhad ever been spoken of, though we had never met, we determined to live\r\ntogether. We wrote to one another on the same subject by the same post,\r\nso exactly did our feeling and our actions coincide! We both eagerly\r\nembraced the proposals we gave and received of becoming one family, and\r\nhave from that time lived together in the greatest affection."\r\n\r\n"And is this all? said I, I hope you have not done."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I have; and did you ever hear a story more pathetic?"\r\n\r\n"I never did--and it is for that reason it pleases me so much, for when\r\none is unhappy nothing is so delightful to one\'s sensations as to hear\r\nof equal misery."\r\n\r\n"Ah! but my Sophia why are YOU unhappy?"\r\n\r\n"Have you not heard Madam of Willoughby\'s Marriage?"\r\n\r\n"But my love why lament HIS perfidy, when you bore so well that of many\r\nyoung Men before?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! Madam, I was used to it then, but when Willoughby broke his\r\nEngagements I had not been dissapointed for half a year."\r\n\r\n"Poor Girl!" said Miss Jane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the THIRD From a YOUNG LADY in distressed Circumstances to her\r\nfreind\r\n\r\nA few days ago I was at a private Ball given by Mr Ashburnham. As my\r\nMother never goes out she entrusted me to the care of Lady Greville who\r\ndid me the honour of calling for me in her way and of allowing me to sit\r\nforwards, which is a favour about which I am very indifferent especially\r\nas I know it is considered as confering a great obligation on me "So\r\nMiss Maria (said her Ladyship as she saw me advancing to the door of the\r\nCarriage) you seem very smart to night--MY poor Girls will appear quite\r\nto disadvantage by YOU--I only hope your Mother may not have distressed\r\nherself to set YOU off. Have you got a new Gown on?"\r\n\r\n"Yes Ma\'am." replied I with as much indifference as I could assume.\r\n\r\n"Aye, and a fine one too I think--(feeling it, as by her permission I\r\nseated myself by her) I dare say it is all very smart--But I must\r\nown, for you know I always speak my mind, that I think it was quite a\r\nneedless piece of expence--Why could not you have worn your old striped\r\none? It is not my way to find fault with People because they are poor,\r\nfor I always think that they are more to be despised and pitied than\r\nblamed for it, especially if they cannot help it, but at the same time I\r\nmust say that in my opinion your old striped Gown would have been quite\r\nfine enough for its Wearer--for to tell you the truth (I always speak my\r\nmind) I am very much afraid that one half of the people in the room will\r\nnot know whether you have a Gown on or not--But I suppose you intend to\r\nmake your fortune to night--. Well, the sooner the better; and I wish\r\nyou success."\r\n\r\n"Indeed Ma\'am I have no such intention--"\r\n\r\n"Who ever heard a young Lady own that she was a Fortune-hunter?" Miss\r\nGreville laughed but I am sure Ellen felt for me.\r\n\r\n"Was your Mother gone to bed before you left her?" said her Ladyship.\r\n\r\n"Dear Ma\'am, said Ellen it is but nine o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"True Ellen, but Candles cost money, and Mrs Williams is too wise to be\r\nextravagant."\r\n\r\n"She was just sitting down to supper Ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"And what had she got for supper?" "I did not observe." "Bread and\r\nCheese I suppose." "I should never wish for a better supper." said\r\nEllen. "You have never any reason replied her Mother, as a better is\r\nalways provided for you." Miss Greville laughed excessively, as she\r\nconstantly does at her Mother\'s wit.\r\n\r\nSuch is the humiliating Situation in which I am forced to appear while\r\nriding in her Ladyship\'s Coach--I dare not be impertinent, as my Mother\r\nis always admonishing me to be humble and patient if I wish to make my\r\nway in the world. She insists on my accepting every invitation of Lady\r\nGreville, or you may be certain that I would never enter either her\r\nHouse, or her Coach with the disagreable certainty I always have of\r\nbeing abused for my Poverty while I am in them.--When we arrived at\r\nAshburnham, it was nearly ten o\'clock, which was an hour and a half\r\nlater than we were desired to be there; but Lady Greville is too\r\nfashionable (or fancies herself to be so) to be punctual. The Dancing\r\nhowever was not begun as they waited for Miss Greville. I had not been\r\nlong in the room before I was engaged to dance by Mr Bernard, but just\r\nas we were going to stand up, he recollected that his Servant had got\r\nhis white Gloves, and immediately ran out to fetch them. In the mean\r\ntime the Dancing began and Lady Greville in passing to another room went\r\nexactly before me--She saw me and instantly stopping, said to me though\r\nthere were several people close to us,\r\n\r\n"Hey day, Miss Maria! What cannot you get a partner? Poor Young Lady!\r\nI am afraid your new Gown was put on for nothing. But do not despair;\r\nperhaps you may get a hop before the Evening is over." So saying, she\r\npassed on without hearing my repeated assurance of being engaged, and\r\nleaving me very much provoked at being so exposed before every one--Mr\r\nBernard however soon returned and by coming to me the moment he entered\r\nthe room, and leading me to the Dancers my Character I hope was cleared\r\nfrom the imputation Lady Greville had thrown on it, in the eyes of all\r\nthe old Ladies who had heard her speech. I soon forgot all my vexations\r\nin the pleasure of dancing and of having the most agreable partner in\r\nthe room. As he is moreover heir to a very large Estate I could see that\r\nLady Greville did not look very well pleased when she found who had been\r\nhis Choice--She was determined to mortify me, and accordingly when we\r\nwere sitting down between the dances, she came to me with more than her\r\nusual insulting importance attended by Miss Mason and said loud enough\r\nto be heard by half the people in the room, "Pray Miss Maria in what\r\nway of business was your Grandfather? for Miss Mason and I cannot agree\r\nwhether he was a Grocer or a Bookbinder." I saw that she wanted to\r\nmortify me, and was resolved if I possibly could to Prevent her seeing\r\nthat her scheme succeeded. "Neither Madam; he was a Wine Merchant."\r\n"Aye, I knew he was in some such low way--He broke did not he?" "I\r\nbeleive not Ma\'am." "Did not he abscond?" "I never heard that he did."\r\n"At least he died insolvent?" "I was never told so before." "Why, was\r\nnot your FATHER as poor as a Rat" "I fancy not." "Was not he in the\r\nKings Bench once?" "I never saw him there." She gave me SUCH a look, and\r\nturned away in a great passion; while I was half delighted with myself\r\nfor my impertinence, and half afraid of being thought too saucy. As Lady\r\nGreville was extremely angry with me, she took no further notice of\r\nme all the Evening, and indeed had I been in favour I should have been\r\nequally neglected, as she was got into a Party of great folks and she\r\nnever speaks to me when she can to anyone else. Miss Greville was with\r\nher Mother\'s party at supper, but Ellen preferred staying with the\r\nBernards and me. We had a very pleasant Dance and as Lady G--slept all\r\nthe way home, I had a very comfortable ride.\r\n\r\nThe next day while we were at dinner Lady Greville\'s Coach stopped at\r\nthe door, for that is the time of day she generally contrives it should.\r\nShe sent in a message by the servant to say that "she should not get out\r\nbut that Miss Maria must come to the Coach-door, as she wanted to speak\r\nto her, and that she must make haste and come immediately--" "What an\r\nimpertinent Message Mama!" said I--"Go Maria--" replied she--Accordingly\r\nI went and was obliged to stand there at her Ladyships pleasure though\r\nthe Wind was extremely high and very cold.\r\n\r\n"Why I think Miss Maria you are not quite so smart as you were last\r\nnight--But I did not come to examine your dress, but to tell you that\r\nyou may dine with us the day after tomorrow--Not tomorrow, remember, do\r\nnot come tomorrow, for we expect Lord and Lady Clermont and Sir Thomas\r\nStanley\'s family--There will be no occasion for your being very fine\r\nfor I shant send the Carriage--If it rains you may take an umbrella--"\r\nI could hardly help laughing at hearing her give me leave to keep myself\r\ndry--"And pray remember to be in time, for I shant wait--I hate my\r\nVictuals over-done--But you need not come before the time--How does\r\nyour Mother do? She is at dinner is not she?" "Yes Ma\'am we were in the\r\nmiddle of dinner when your Ladyship came." "I am afraid you find it very\r\ncold Maria." said Ellen. "Yes, it is an horrible East wind--said her\r\nMother--I assure you I can hardly bear the window down--But you are used\r\nto be blown about by the wind Miss Maria and that is what has made your\r\nComplexion so rudely and coarse. You young Ladies who cannot often ride\r\nin a Carriage never mind what weather you trudge in, or how the wind\r\nshews your legs. I would not have my Girls stand out of doors as you do\r\nin such a day as this. But some sort of people have no feelings either\r\nof cold or Delicacy--Well, remember that we shall expect you on Thursday\r\nat 5 o\'clock--You must tell your Maid to come for you at night--There\r\nwill be no Moon--and you will have an horrid walk home--My compts to\r\nYour Mother--I am afraid your dinner will be cold--Drive on--" And away\r\nshe went, leaving me in a great passion with her as she always does.\r\nMaria Williams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the FOURTH From a YOUNG LADY rather impertinent to her freind\r\n\r\nWe dined yesterday with Mr Evelyn where we were introduced to a very\r\nagreable looking Girl his Cousin. I was extremely pleased with her\r\nappearance, for added to the charms of an engaging face, her manner and\r\nvoice had something peculiarly interesting in them. So much so, that\r\nthey inspired me with a great curiosity to know the history of her Life,\r\nwho were her Parents, where she came from, and what had befallen her,\r\nfor it was then only known that she was a relation of Mr Evelyn, and\r\nthat her name was Grenville. In the evening a favourable opportunity\r\noffered to me of attempting at least to know what I wished to know, for\r\nevery one played at Cards but Mrs Evelyn, My Mother, Dr Drayton, Miss\r\nGrenville and myself, and as the two former were engaged in a whispering\r\nConversation, and the Doctor fell asleep, we were of necessity obliged\r\nto entertain each other. This was what I wished and being determined not\r\nto remain in ignorance for want of asking, I began the Conversation in\r\nthe following Manner.\r\n\r\n"Have you been long in Essex Ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"I arrived on Tuesday."\r\n\r\n"You came from Derbyshire?"\r\n\r\n"No, Ma\'am! appearing surprised at my question, from Suffolk." You will\r\nthink this a good dash of mine my dear Mary, but you know that I am not\r\nwanting for Impudence when I have any end in veiw. "Are you pleased with\r\nthe Country Miss Grenville? Do you find it equal to the one you have\r\nleft?"\r\n\r\n"Much superior Ma\'am in point of Beauty." She sighed. I longed to know\r\nfor why.\r\n\r\n"But the face of any Country however beautiful said I, can be but a poor\r\nconsolation for the loss of one\'s dearest Freinds." She shook her\r\nhead, as if she felt the truth of what I said. My Curiosity was so much\r\nraised, that I was resolved at any rate to satisfy it.\r\n\r\n"You regret having left Suffolk then Miss Grenville?" "Indeed I do."\r\n"You were born there I suppose?" "Yes Ma\'am I was and passed many happy\r\nyears there--"\r\n\r\n"That is a great comfort--said I--I hope Ma\'am that you never spent any\r\nunhappy one\'s there."\r\n\r\n"Perfect Felicity is not the property of Mortals, and no one has a right\r\nto expect uninterrupted Happiness.--Some Misfortunes I have certainly\r\nmet with."\r\n\r\n"WHAT Misfortunes dear Ma\'am? replied I, burning with impatience to know\r\nevery thing. "NONE Ma\'am I hope that have been the effect of any wilfull\r\nfault in me." "I dare say not Ma\'am, and have no doubt but that any\r\nsufferings you may have experienced could arise only from the cruelties\r\nof Relations or the Errors of Freinds." She sighed--"You seem unhappy\r\nmy dear Miss Grenville--Is it in my power to soften your Misfortunes?"\r\n"YOUR power Ma\'am replied she extremely surprised; it is in NO ONES\r\npower to make me happy." She pronounced these words in so mournfull and\r\nsolemn an accent, that for some time I had not courage to reply. I\r\nwas actually silenced. I recovered myself however in a few moments and\r\nlooking at her with all the affection I could, "My dear Miss Grenville\r\nsaid I, you appear extremely young--and may probably stand in need of\r\nsome one\'s advice whose regard for you, joined to superior Age, perhaps\r\nsuperior Judgement might authorise her to give it. I am that person, and\r\nI now challenge you to accept the offer I make you of my Confidence and\r\nFreindship, in return to which I shall only ask for yours--"\r\n\r\n"You are extremely obliging Ma\'am--said she--and I am highly flattered\r\nby your attention to me--But I am in no difficulty, no doubt, no\r\nuncertainty of situation in which any advice can be wanted. Whenever I\r\nam however continued she brightening into a complaisant smile, I shall\r\nknow where to apply."\r\n\r\nI bowed, but felt a good deal mortified by such a repulse; still however\r\nI had not given up my point. I found that by the appearance of sentiment\r\nand Freindship nothing was to be gained and determined therefore to\r\nrenew my attacks by Questions and suppositions. "Do you intend staying\r\nlong in this part of England Miss Grenville?"\r\n\r\n"Yes Ma\'am, some time I beleive."\r\n\r\n"But how will Mr and Mrs Grenville bear your absence?"\r\n\r\n"They are neither of them alive Ma\'am." This was an answer I did not\r\nexpect--I was quite silenced, and never felt so awkward in my Life---.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER the FIFTH From a YOUNG LADY very much in love to her Freind\r\n\r\nMy Uncle gets more stingy, my Aunt more particular, and I more in love\r\nevery day. What shall we all be at this rate by the end of the year! I\r\nhad this morning the happiness of receiving the following Letter from my\r\ndear Musgrove.\r\n\r\nSackville St: Janry 7th It is a month to day since I first beheld my\r\nlovely Henrietta, and the sacred anniversary must and shall be kept in\r\na manner becoming the day--by writing to her. Never shall I forget the\r\nmoment when her Beauties first broke on my sight--No time as you well\r\nknow can erase it from my Memory. It was at Lady Scudamores. Happy Lady\r\nScudamore to live within a mile of the divine Henrietta! When the lovely\r\nCreature first entered the room, oh! what were my sensations? The sight\r\nof you was like the sight ofa wonderful fine Thing. I started--I gazed\r\nat her with admiration--She appeared every moment more Charming, and the\r\nunfortunate Musgrove became a captive to your Charms before I had time\r\nto look about me. Yes Madam, I had the happiness of adoring you, an\r\nhappiness for which I cannot be too grateful. "What said he to himself\r\nis Musgrove allowed to die for Henrietta? Enviable Mortal! and may he\r\npine for her who is the object of universal admiration, who is adored\r\nby a Colonel, and toasted by a Baronet! Adorable Henrietta how beautiful\r\nyou are! I declare you are quite divine! You are more than Mortal.\r\nYou are an Angel. You are Venus herself. In short Madam you are the\r\nprettiest Girl I ever saw in my Life--and her Beauty is encreased in her\r\nMusgroves Eyes, by permitting him to love her and allowing me to hope.\r\nAnd ah! Angelic Miss Henrietta Heaven is my witness how ardently I do\r\nhope for the death of your villanous Uncle and his abandoned Wife, since\r\nmy fair one will not consent to be mine till their decease has placed\r\nher in affluence above what my fortune can procure--. Though it is an\r\nimprovable Estate--. Cruel Henrietta to persist in such a resolution! I\r\nam at Present with my sister where I mean to continue till my own house\r\nwhich tho\' an excellent one is at Present somewhat out of repair, is\r\nready to receive me. Amiable princess of my Heart farewell--Of that\r\nHeart which trembles while it signs itself Your most ardent Admirer and\r\ndevoted humble servt. T. Musgrove.\r\n\r\nThere is a pattern for a Love-letter Matilda! Did you ever read such\r\na master-piece of Writing? Such sense, such sentiment, such purity of\r\nThought, such flow of Language and such unfeigned Love in one sheet?\r\nNo, never I can answer for it, since a Musgrove is not to be met with\r\nby every Girl. Oh! how I long to be with him! I intend to send him the\r\nfollowing in answer to his Letter tomorrow.\r\n\r\nMy dearest Musgrove--. Words cannot express how happy your Letter made\r\nme; I thought I should have cried for joy, for I love you better than\r\nany body in the World. I think you the most amiable, and the handsomest\r\nMan in England, and so to be sure you are. I never read so sweet a\r\nLetter in my Life. Do write me another just like it, and tell me you are\r\nin love with me in every other line. I quite die to see you. How shall\r\nwe manage to see one another? for we are so much in love that we cannot\r\nlive asunder. Oh! my dear Musgrove you cannot think how impatiently I\r\nwait for the death of my Uncle and Aunt--If they will not Die soon, I\r\nbeleive I shall run mad, for I get more in love with you every day of my\r\nLife.\r\n\r\nHow happy your Sister is to enjoy the pleasure of your Company in her\r\nhouse, and how happy every body in London must be because you are there.\r\nI hope you will be so kind as to write to me again soon, for I never\r\nread such sweet Letters as yours. I am my dearest Musgrove most truly\r\nand faithfully yours for ever and ever Henrietta Halton.\r\n\r\nI hope he will like my answer; it is as good a one as I can write\r\nthough nothing to his; Indeed I had always heard what a dab he was at\r\na Love-letter. I saw him you know for the first time at Lady\r\nScudamores--And when I saw her Ladyship afterwards she asked me how I\r\nliked her Cousin Musgrove?\r\n\r\n"Why upon my word said I, I think he is a very handsome young Man."\r\n\r\n"I am glad you think so replied she, for he is distractedly in love with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Law! Lady Scudamore said I, how can you talk so ridiculously?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, t\'is very true answered she, I assure you, for he was in love with\r\nyou from the first moment he beheld you."\r\n\r\n"I wish it may be true said I, for that is the only kind of love I\r\nwould give a farthing for--There is some sense in being in love at first\r\nsight."\r\n\r\n"Well, I give you Joy of your conquest, replied Lady Scudamore, and\r\nI beleive it to have been a very complete one; I am sure it is not a\r\ncontemptible one, for my Cousin is a charming young fellow, has seen a\r\ngreat deal of the World, and writes the best Love-letters I ever read."\r\n\r\nThis made me very happy, and I was excessively pleased with my conquest.\r\nHowever, I thought it was proper to give myself a few Airs--so I said to\r\nher--\r\n\r\n"This is all very pretty Lady Scudamore, but you know that we young\r\nLadies who are Heiresses must not throw ourselves away upon Men who have\r\nno fortune at all."\r\n\r\n"My dear Miss Halton said she, I am as much convinced of that as you can\r\nbe, and I do assure you that I should be the last person to encourage\r\nyour marrying anyone who had not some pretensions to expect a fortune\r\nwith you. Mr Musgrove is so far from being poor that he has an estate of\r\nseveral hundreds an year which is capable of great Improvement, and an\r\nexcellent House, though at Present it is not quite in repair."\r\n\r\n"If that is the case replied I, I have nothing more to say against\r\nhim, and if as you say he is an informed young Man and can write a\r\ngood Love-letter, I am sure I have no reason to find fault with him\r\nfor admiring me, tho\' perhaps I may not marry him for all that Lady\r\nScudamore."\r\n\r\n"You are certainly under no obligation to marry him answered her\r\nLadyship, except that which love himself will dictate to you, for if I\r\nam not greatly mistaken you are at this very moment unknown to yourself,\r\ncherishing a most tender affection for him."\r\n\r\n"Law, Lady Scudamore replied I blushing how can you think of such a\r\nthing?"\r\n\r\n"Because every look, every word betrays it, answered she; Come my dear\r\nHenrietta, consider me as a freind, and be sincere with me--Do not you\r\nprefer Mr Musgrove to any man of your acquaintance?"\r\n\r\n"Pray do not ask me such questions Lady Scudamore, said I turning away\r\nmy head, for it is not fit for me to answer them."\r\n\r\n"Nay my Love replied she, now you confirm my suspicions. But why\r\nHenrietta should you be ashamed to own a well-placed Love, or why refuse\r\nto confide in me?"\r\n\r\n"I am not ashamed to own it; said I taking Courage. I do not refuse to\r\nconfide in you or blush to say that I do love your cousin Mr Musgrove,\r\nthat I am sincerely attached to him, for it is no disgrace to love a\r\nhandsome Man. If he were plain indeed I might have had reason to be\r\nashamed of a passion which must have been mean since the object would\r\nhave been unworthy. But with such a figure and face, and such beautiful\r\nhair as your Cousin has, why should I blush to own that such superior\r\nmerit has made an impression on me."\r\n\r\n"My sweet Girl (said Lady Scudamore embracing me with great affection)\r\nwhat a delicate way of thinking you have in these matters, and what a\r\nquick discernment for one of your years! Oh! how I honour you for such\r\nNoble Sentiments!"\r\n\r\n"Do you Ma\'am said I; You are vastly obliging. But pray Lady Scudamore\r\ndid your Cousin himself tell you of his affection for me I shall like\r\nhim the better if he did, for what is a Lover without a Confidante?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! my Love replied she, you were born for each other. Every word\r\nyou say more deeply convinces me that your Minds are actuated by the\r\ninvisible power of simpathy, for your opinions and sentiments so exactly\r\ncoincide. Nay, the colour of your Hair is not very different. Yes my\r\ndear Girl, the poor despairing Musgrove did reveal to me the story of\r\nhis Love--. Nor was I surprised at it--I know not how it was, but I had\r\na kind of presentiment that he would be in love with you."\r\n\r\n"Well, but how did he break it to you?"\r\n\r\n"It was not till after supper. We were sitting round the fire\r\ntogether talking on indifferent subjects, though to say the truth the\r\nConversation was cheifly on my side for he was thoughtful and silent,\r\nwhen on a sudden he interrupted me in the midst of something I was\r\nsaying, by exclaiming in a most Theatrical tone--\r\n\r\nYes I\'m in love I feel it now And Henrietta Halton has undone me\r\n\r\n"Oh! What a sweet way replied I, of declaring his Passion! To make such\r\na couple of charming lines about me! What a pity it is that they are not\r\nin rhime!"\r\n\r\n"I am very glad you like it answered she; To be sure there was a great\r\ndeal of Taste in it. And are you in love with her, Cousin? said I. I am\r\nvery sorry for it, for unexceptionable as you are in every respect, with\r\na pretty Estate capable of Great improvements, and an excellent House\r\ntho\' somewhat out of repair, yet who can hope to aspire with success\r\nto the adorable Henrietta who has had an offer from a Colonel and\r\nbeen toasted by a Baronet"--"THAT I have--" cried I. Lady Scudamore\r\ncontinued. "Ah dear Cousin replied he, I am so well convinced of the\r\nlittle Chance I can have of winning her who is adored by thousands, that\r\nI need no assurances of yours to make me more thoroughly so. Yet surely\r\nneither you or the fair Henrietta herself will deny me the exquisite\r\nGratification of dieing for her, of falling a victim to her Charms. And\r\nwhen I am dead"--continued her--\r\n\r\n"Oh Lady Scudamore, said I wiping my eyes, that such a sweet Creature\r\nshould talk of dieing!"\r\n\r\n"It is an affecting Circumstance indeed, replied Lady Scudamore." "When\r\nI am dead said he, let me be carried and lain at her feet, and perhaps\r\nshe may not disdain to drop a pitying tear on my poor remains."\r\n\r\n"Dear Lady Scudamore interrupted I, say no more on this affecting\r\nsubject. I cannot bear it."\r\n\r\n"Oh! how I admire the sweet sensibility of your Soul, and as I would not\r\nfor Worlds wound it too deeply, I will be silent."\r\n\r\n"Pray go on." said I. She did so.\r\n\r\n"And then added he, Ah! Cousin imagine what my transports will be when\r\nI feel the dear precious drops trickle on my face! Who would not die\r\nto haste such extacy! And when I am interred, may the divine Henrietta\r\nbless some happier Youth with her affection, May he be as tenderly\r\nattached to her as the hapless Musgrove and while HE crumbles to dust,\r\nMay they live an example of Felicity in the Conjugal state!"\r\n\r\nDid you ever hear any thing so pathetic? What a charming wish, to be\r\nlain at my feet when he was dead! Oh! what an exalted mind he must have\r\nto be capable of such a wish! Lady Scudamore went on.\r\n\r\n"Ah! my dear Cousin replied I to him, such noble behaviour as this, must\r\nmelt the heart of any woman however obdurate it may naturally be;\r\nand could the divine Henrietta but hear your generous wishes for her\r\nhappiness, all gentle as is her mind, I have not a doubt but that she\r\nwould pity your affection and endeavour to return it." "Oh! Cousin\r\nanswered he, do not endeavour to raise my hopes by such flattering\r\nassurances. No, I cannot hope to please this angel of a Woman, and the\r\nonly thing which remains for me to do, is to die." "True Love is ever\r\ndesponding replied I, but I my dear Tom will give you even greater\r\nhopes of conquering this fair one\'s heart, than I have yet given you, by\r\nassuring you that I watched her with the strictest attention during the\r\nwhole day, and could plainly discover that she cherishes in her bosom\r\nthough unknown to herself, a most tender affection for you."\r\n\r\n"Dear Lady Scudamore cried I, This is more than I ever knew!"\r\n\r\n"Did not I say that it was unknown to yourself? I did not, continued\r\nI to him, encourage you by saying this at first, that surprise might\r\nrender the pleasure still Greater." "No Cousin replied he in a languid\r\nvoice, nothing will convince me that I can have touched the heart of\r\nHenrietta Halton, and if you are deceived yourself, do not attempt\r\ndeceiving me." "In short my Love it was the work of some hours for me to\r\nPersuade the poor despairing Youth that you had really a preference for\r\nhim; but when at last he could no longer deny the force of my arguments,\r\nor discredit what I told him, his transports, his Raptures, his Extacies\r\nare beyond my power to describe."\r\n\r\n"Oh! the dear Creature, cried I, how passionately he loves me! But dear\r\nLady Scudamore did you tell him that I was totally dependant on my Uncle\r\nand Aunt?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I told him every thing."\r\n\r\n"And what did he say."\r\n\r\n"He exclaimed with virulence against Uncles and Aunts; Accused the laws\r\nof England for allowing them to Possess their Estates when wanted by\r\ntheir Nephews or Neices, and wished HE were in the House of Commons,\r\nthat he might reform the Legislature, and rectify all its abuses."\r\n\r\n"Oh! the sweet Man! What a spirit he has!" said I.\r\n\r\n"He could not flatter himself he added, that the adorable Henrietta\r\nwould condescend for his sake to resign those Luxuries and that splendor\r\nto which she had been used, and accept only in exchange the Comforts\r\nand Elegancies which his limited Income could afford her, even supposing\r\nthat his house were in Readiness to receive her. I told him that it\r\ncould not be expected that she would; it would be doing her an injustice\r\nto suppose her capable of giving up the power she now possesses and so\r\nnobly uses of doing such extensive Good to the poorer part of her fellow\r\nCreatures, merely for the gratification of you and herself."\r\n\r\n"To be sure said I, I AM very Charitable every now and then. And what\r\ndid Mr Musgrove say to this?"\r\n\r\n"He replied that he was under a melancholy necessity of owning the truth\r\nof what I said, and that therefore if he should be the happy Creature\r\ndestined to be the Husband of the Beautiful Henrietta he must bring\r\nhimself to wait, however impatiently, for the fortunate day, when she\r\nmight be freed from the power of worthless Relations and able to bestow\r\nherself on him."\r\n\r\nWhat a noble Creature he is! Oh! Matilda what a fortunate one I am, who\r\nam to be his Wife! My Aunt is calling me to come and make the pies, so\r\nadeiu my dear freind, and beleive me yours etc--H. Halton.\r\n\r\nFinis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCRAPS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Miss FANNY CATHERINE AUSTEN\r\n\r\nMY Dear Neice As I am prevented by the great distance between Rowling\r\nand Steventon from superintending your Education myself, the care of\r\nwhich will probably on that account devolve on your Father and Mother,\r\nI think it is my particular Duty to Prevent your feeling as much as\r\npossible the want of my personal instructions, by addressing to you on\r\npaper my Opinions and Admonitions on the conduct of Young Women, which\r\nyou will find expressed in the following pages.--I am my dear Neice Your\r\naffectionate Aunt The Author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FEMALE PHILOSOPHER\r\n\r\nA LETTER\r\n\r\nMy Dear Louisa Your friend Mr Millar called upon us yesterday in his way\r\nto Bath, whither he is going for his health; two of his daughters were\r\nwith him, but the eldest and the three Boys are with their Mother in\r\nSussex. Though you have often told me that Miss Millar was remarkably\r\nhandsome, you never mentioned anything of her Sisters\' beauty; yet they\r\nare certainly extremely pretty. I\'ll give you their description.--Julia\r\nis eighteen; with a countenance in which Modesty, Sense and Dignity are\r\nhappily blended, she has a form which at once presents you with Grace,\r\nElegance and Symmetry. Charlotte who is just sixteen is shorter than her\r\nSister, and though her figure cannot boast the easy dignity of\r\nJulia\'s, yet it has a pleasing plumpness which is in a different way as\r\nestimable. She is fair and her face is expressive sometimes of softness\r\nthe most bewitching, and at others of Vivacity the most striking.\r\nShe appears to have infinite Wit and a good humour unalterable; her\r\nconversation during the half hour they set with us, was replete with\r\nhumourous sallies, Bonmots and repartees; while the sensible, the\r\namiable Julia uttered sentiments of Morality worthy of a heart like her\r\nown. Mr Millar appeared to answer the character I had always received\r\nof him. My Father met him with that look of Love, that social Shake, and\r\ncordial kiss which marked his gladness at beholding an old and valued\r\nfreind from whom thro\' various circumstances he had been separated\r\nnearly twenty years. Mr Millar observed (and very justly too) that\r\nmany events had befallen each during that interval of time, which gave\r\noccasion to the lovely Julia for making most sensible reflections on the\r\nmany changes in their situation which so long a period had occasioned,\r\non the advantages of some, and the disadvantages of others. From\r\nthis subject she made a short digression to the instability of human\r\npleasures and the uncertainty of their duration, which led her to\r\nobserve that all earthly Joys must be imperfect. She was proceeding to\r\nillustrate this doctrine by examples from the Lives of great Men when\r\nthe Carriage came to the Door and the amiable Moralist with her Father\r\nand Sister was obliged to depart; but not without a promise of spending\r\nfive or six months with us on their return. We of course mentioned you,\r\nand I assure you that ample Justice was done to your Merits by all.\r\n"Louisa Clarke (said I) is in general a very pleasant Girl, yet\r\nsometimes her good humour is clouded by Peevishness, Envy and Spite. She\r\nneither wants Understanding or is without some pretensions to Beauty,\r\nbut these are so very trifling, that the value she sets on her personal\r\ncharms, and the adoration she expects them to be offered are at once a\r\nstriking example of her vanity, her pride, and her folly." So said I,\r\nand to my opinion everyone added weight by the concurrence of their own.\r\nYour affectionate Arabella Smythe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST ACT OF A COMEDY\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS Popgun Maria Charles Pistolletta Postilion Hostess Chorus of\r\nploughboys Cook and                      and\r\nStrephon Chloe\r\n\r\nSCENE--AN INN\r\n\r\nENTER Hostess, Charles, Maria, and Cook.\r\n\r\nHostess to Maria) If the gentry in the Lion should want beds, shew them\r\nnumber 9.\r\n\r\nMaria) Yes Mistress.--EXIT Maria\r\n\r\nHostess to Cook) If their Honours in the Moon ask for the bill of fare,\r\ngive it them.\r\n\r\nCook) I wull, I wull.

But I will pawn to you an\r\nundirected Letter that I received from Chloe.\r\n\r\nPost:) Sir, I accept your offer.\r\n\r\nEND OF THE FIRST ACT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LETTER from a YOUNG LADY, whose feelings being too strong for\r\nher Judgement led her into the commission of Errors which her Heart\r\ndisapproved.\r\n\r\nMany have been the cares and vicissitudes of my past life, my beloved\r\nEllinor, and the only consolation I feel for their bitterness is that on\r\na close examination of my conduct, I am convinced that I have strictly\r\ndeserved them. I murdered my father at a very early period of my Life, I\r\nhave since murdered my Mother, and I am now going to murder my Sister. I\r\nhave changed my religion so often that at present I have not an idea of\r\nany left. I have been a perjured witness in every public tryal for these\r\nlast twelve years; and I have forged my own Will. In short there is\r\nscarcely a crime that I have not committed--But I am now going to\r\nreform. Colonel Martin of the Horse guards has paid his Addresses to me,\r\nand we are to be married in a few days. As there is something singular\r\nin our Courtship, I will give you an account of it. Colonel Martin is\r\nthe second son of the late Sir John Martin who died immensely rich, but\r\nbequeathing only one hundred thousand pound apeice to his three younger\r\nChildren, left the bulk of his fortune, about eight Million to the\r\npresent Sir Thomas. Upon his small pittance the Colonel lived tolerably\r\ncontented for nearly four months when he took it into his head to\r\ndetermine on getting the whole of his eldest Brother\'s Estate. A new\r\nwill was forged and the Colonel produced it in Court--but nobody would\r\nswear to it\'s being the right will except himself, and he had sworn so\r\nmuch that Nobody beleived him. At that moment I happened to be passing\r\nby the door of the Court, and was beckoned in by the Judge who told the\r\nColonel that I was a Lady ready to witness anything for the cause of\r\nJustice, and advised him to apply to me. In short the Affair was soon\r\nadjusted. The Colonel and I swore to its\' being the right will, and Sir\r\nThomas has been obliged to resign all his illgotten wealth. The Colonel\r\nin gratitude waited on me the next day with an offer of his hand--. I am\r\nnow going to murder my Sister. Yours Ever, Anna Parker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TOUR THROUGH WALES--in a LETTER from a YOUNG LADY--\r\n\r\nMy Dear Clara I have been so long on the ramble that I have not till now\r\nhad it in my power to thank you for your Letter--. We left our dear home\r\non last Monday month; and proceeded on our tour through Wales, which is\r\na principality contiguous to England and gives the title to the Prince\r\nof Wales. We travelled on horseback by preference. My Mother rode upon\r\nour little poney and Fanny and I walked by her side or rather ran, for\r\nmy Mother is so fond of riding fast that she galloped all the way. You\r\nmay be sure that we were in a fine perspiration when we came to our\r\nplace of resting. Fanny has taken a great many Drawings of the Country,\r\nwhich are very beautiful, tho\' perhaps not such exact resemblances\r\nas might be wished, from their being taken as she ran along. It would\r\nastonish you to see all the Shoes we wore out in our Tour. We determined\r\nto take a good Stock with us and therefore each took a pair of our own\r\nbesides those we set off in. However we were obliged to have them both\r\ncapped and heelpeiced at Carmarthen, and at last when they were quite\r\ngone, Mama was so kind as to lend us a pair of blue Sattin Slippers, of\r\nwhich we each took one and hopped home from Hereford delightfully---I am\r\nyour ever affectionate Elizabeth Johnson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TALE.\r\n\r\nA Gentleman whose family name I shall conceal, bought a small Cottage in\r\nPembrokeshire about two years ago. This daring Action was suggested to\r\nhim by his elder Brother who promised to furnish two rooms and a Closet\r\nfor him, provided he would take a small house near the borders of an\r\nextensive Forest, and about three Miles from the Sea. Wilhelminus gladly\r\naccepted the offer and continued for some time searching after such a\r\nretreat when he was one morning agreably releived from his suspence by\r\nreading this advertisement in a Newspaper.\r\n\r\nTO BE LETT A Neat Cottage on the borders of an extensive forest and\r\nabout three Miles from the Sea. It is ready furnished except two rooms\r\nand a Closet.\r\n\r\nThe delighted Wilhelminus posted away immediately to his brother, and\r\nshewed him the advertisement. Robertus congratulated him and sent him\r\nin his Carriage to take possession of the Cottage. After travelling for\r\nthree days and six nights without stopping, they arrived at the Forest\r\nand following a track which led by it\'s side down a steep Hill over\r\nwhich ten Rivulets meandered, they reached the Cottage in half an hour.\r\nWilhelminus alighted, and after knocking for some time without receiving\r\nany answer or hearing any one stir within, he opened the door which\r\nwas fastened only by a wooden latch and entered a small room, which he\r\nimmediately perceived to be one of the two that were unfurnished--From\r\nthence he proceeded into a Closet equally bare. A pair of stairs that\r\nwent out of it led him into a room above, no less destitute, and these\r\napartments he found composed the whole of the House. He was by no means\r\ndispleased with this discovery, as he had the comfort of reflecting that\r\nhe should not be obliged to lay out anything on furniture himself--. He\r\nreturned immediately to his Brother, who took him the next day to every\r\nShop in Town, and bought what ever was requisite to furnish the two\r\nrooms and the Closet, In a few days everything was completed, and\r\nWilhelminus returned to take possession of his Cottage. Robertus\r\naccompanied him, with his Lady the amiable Cecilia and her two lovely\r\nSisters Arabella and Marina to whom Wilhelminus was tenderly attached,\r\nand a large number of Attendants.--An ordinary Genius might probably\r\nhave been embarrassed, in endeavouring to accomodate so large a party,\r\nbut Wilhelminus with admirable presence of mind gave orders for the\r\nimmediate erection of two noble Tents in an open spot in the Forest\r\nadjoining to the house. Their Construction was both simple and\r\nelegant--A couple of old blankets, each supported by four sticks, gave\r\na striking proof of that taste for architecture and that happy ease in\r\novercoming difficulties which were some of Wilhelminus\'s most striking\r\nVirtues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Love And Freindship And Other Early\r\nWorks, by Jane Austen\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LOVE AND FREINDSHIP ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1212.txt or 1212.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/2/1/1212/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
