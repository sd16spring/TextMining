VI have been playing it, I think we have faced each other before. I am always so close to 5-0 but then I get paired against RG Combo lands or something which ruins my streak.\u000a\u000aThe good news is that Eldrazi are everywhere and I feel like that mathcup is practically a bye.\u000a\u000aI streamed today going 4-0 vs Storm, Goblins, and 2x Eldrazi.\u000a\u000aI was doing fine in the daily events too, but the 5-0 has eluded me thanks to Guided Passage and other such nonsense.
p1
aVAs a shardless player, how do you feel about the Goblins matchup? Is it essentially a bye for you?
p2
aVIt can definitely get out of hand, but I feel pretty favored in the matchup, probably 60/40
p3
aVWhy do you consider the eldrazi deck a bye for shardless?
p4
aVFuckin think about it.\u000a\u000a\u000aI cant think of a card that seems bad in that match-up
p5
aVI would imagine [[Abrupt Decay]] isn't great?
p6
aVWell it hits any lock pieces so I don't see it being bad

aVIt's an answer to all the lockpieces you have to play because you're just a dumb creature deck
p9
aVI have beaten it every time I have played against it, which is 9 times. I did lose to a different variant that ran Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, but the typical Thought-Knot versions are very easy to beat.
p10
aVMaybe, I've honestly only played it once and it was actually an mirror. Real back and forth where I fought through a Lili and Jace on the board, finally Hymn my opponent down to 0 cards, slam a 6/7 Goyf opponent at 6, then they hit Maelstrom Pulse into Deathrite and I lose.\u000a\u000aI've been lucky to hit my 5-0s. Honestly it was weird, I was incredibly discouraged going 0-5,0-5, then 5-0,5-0,4-1. The second time when I went 0-5 I hit Dredge 4 times (2 manaless, 2 LED), thought MTGO just hated me.
p11
aVYeah I was that Shardless player. That game was intense.
p12
aVWhat is your twitch name?

aVRandom sample is random. In my three leagues, I played Shardless at least once per five matches, and often times twice. By contrast, I've never played against Miracles in a league match.
p15
aVI play against miracles at least once per league. It's even more miserable on mtgo than in real life. 
p16
aVThe problem with using Leagues as results is that they aren't real results. Every match you play in a league is a random pairing for somebody else in the league looking to play. It has nothing to do with your record like it does in a Swiss tournament. Because of this, going 5-0 doesn't mean you're playing against other 4-0's and battling out for "first place". In a real tournament, as you move along in the rounds you're going to get paired against better competition and most of the time better decks. You're seeing a lot of nonsense decks crop up in the 5-0 because maybe that player didn't have to face such stiff competition and most likely didn't have to play against Miracles at all. League results should be taken with a big grain of salt. 
p17
aVI thought leagues matched you up with opponents with the same record.
p18
aVThey make some attempt to, but given the smaller number of player in the Legacy one there's not many options for it to work with, and the pairing is pretty random.
p19
aVUnfortunately, no. You can get paired with somebody of a different record. 
p20
aVHeck, I've been paired with the *same* opponent within a single 5-round league.  And it was a bad matchup for me!
p21
aVI have, too. But I think it was a new league for him, even though he was my 2nd and 4th round opponent in the same league. 
p22
aVI would enjoy seeing a bit more Shardless and a bit less Eldrazi.  Actually played 4 games last night and they were two of each of those.  I can check once I get home on the number of types of decks I've seen in 5 leagues so far.
