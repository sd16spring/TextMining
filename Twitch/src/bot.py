Simple IRC Bot for Twitch.tv

Developed by Aidan Thomson <aidraj0@gmail.com>

"""
Used by Kevin Zhang for Text Mining/Analysis course project in Software Design at Franklin W. Olin College, Spring 2016

Aidan's code was used as the base code, and I did some significant modifications for the purposes of text mining and text analysis.

Note that most of his function were not used, only the basic draws from Twitch API. Everything else is my own creation.
