aS"thank you a lot that really help me in my faith in god and Jesus I try to \nbe holy but I be failing a lot \ncus i grew up in Compton California and all i been taught was to fight \nsteal and sell drugs and grow weed by my older brother and friends in that \ngangster life style unfortunately i did got into that life style for about \n1yr and a half i'll confess i had a gun at the age of 15 sneak in houses \nand steal\nfight to get a reputation for my name did a lot through out my life that I \ncouldnt believe but i use ta still tell jesus to forgive me cus even tho i \nwas a g i wasn't that stupid to not believe in God \nat that time i didnt know if was real or not but i wanted him to be real \nso much that i started praying and it felt real took of my pain and \nstruggles i had my whole life even the pain and struggle I went through \nwhen my dad died when i was seven \ni liked it that there that chu spit its real \nand I do believe that Jesus is the son of God"
p69
aS'4. How does Jesus   look like & the Return of Jesus:\n\nAbu Huraira narrated that Prophet Mohammad     said: "There \nis no prophet between me and him (Jesus Christ   ). He shall \ndescend (in Damascus, Syria) so, recognize him when you see him. He is a \nman of medium height, (his complexion) is between reddish and white; he \nwill be between (or dressed in) two slightly yellowish garments; His head \nlooks as if it is dripping water even though it is not wet. He will fight \npeople in the cause (for the sake) of Islam, will break the Cross (that \nChristians took as Idolatry) and kill the swine (pig) and abolish Jizya \n(tax on Christians and Jews); and Allah will put an end to all religious \nsects except Islam during his (Jesus\') time. He (Jesus) will slay the \nAntichrist (Dajjal) and he will stay in the World for 40 years. Then, he \nwill die and the Muslims will perform the funeral prayer for him." (Abu \nDawud and Musnad Ahmad)'

aS'This sounds like the usual "My magical pony is more real than yours, and \nyour magical pony is *BADDDD*" that starts all those wars in the first \nplace. Sounds to me like you\'re claiming that every other god is just \nsomething people believe in and therefore just "Religion" while jesus is \ntaken to the next level cause he\'s *REALLLL*. I can\'t take this. It\'s so \nfucking contradictional and passively aggressive, the cringe hurts to the \nbone.'

aS"You can be an atheist, or believe in God or you can worship the sun, moon, \nThe Beatles if you want. And that's ok in my book, for as long as you try \nto be a good person to others as well as yourself, and try to help others \nwho are in need, whether one person or a thousand of them, then you are \ndoing the SIMPLE teachings of Jesus. In a nut shell.....Try to not be an \nasshole in this life, Do something to make life a bit more enjoyable. IF \nEVERYONE DID THIS THAN WE WOULD BE HAPPIER. ORGANISED religion IS NOT \nNEEDED!!!"
p73
aS"Christianity is still a religion, but this guy's right because it's MORE \nthan a religion. It goes further than any religion does. Jesus is the Way, \nthe Truth, and the Life."
p74
aS"Actually, Christianity is not a religion, it is a Relationship. You can not \ncall yourself a Christian if you don't live it out, if you don't follow \nwhat he says. Just sayin' :D"
p75
aS'Translated: I am an idolatrous and I have a morbose obsession to a man who \nlived some time ago. But at the same time I behave like an atheist and \nthink like an atheist.'
p76
aS"I love your frame of mind but to say you're a Christian contradicts what \nyou said of hating religion. Christianity is a religion. I hate religion \nand believe it's dang near a false idol. I believe in God. My higher power \nand creator. Not in a religious view. I was raised Christian and as I grew \nolder I went out on my own and discovered my God. We are all the son and \ndaughters of God. Jesus walked the earth and died on the cross (along with \na lot of other people), but God is my father and higher power. I can quote \nthe bible, have been baptized twice, and know a lot about Christianity, but \nI stopped reading the Bible. Man wrote it and it has been rewritten and \ntranslated hundreds of times. How do we know that is how we should live our \nlives? What if someone translated it originally and wrote what they thought \nwas the right way to live throwing in stories here and there with actual \nnames but in false testimony? Have faith people say...my faith is with God \nand God is greater than all!"

aS'30MM+ views, not bad. Ppl are often perplexed, maybe frustrated, or even \nangry about how in the world someone like Jefferson Bethke can exist, say \nwhat they have to say, and promote what they do. After all, it just doesn\'t \nmake any sense! You always see the same comments, trash talking christians \nand christianity, making claims that Jesus never existed and so on. But \nhere is someone who is taking the time to draw a distinction between \nreligion and Jesus, which really has the intention to draw the viewer\'s \nattention to Jesus. And that is a step in the right direction, because \nreligion = Man, and Jesus is Jesus.\n\nNow, whether or not Jesus is misrepresented in holy books, words placed in \nhis mouth, or stories invented with a version of poetic license to \nembellish the point trying to be made are all interesting areas to probe, \nbut they are not central.\n\nWhat *is* central is Jesus, and the question of where do ppl like JB come \nfrom? And it isn\'t just him. It is ppl with the *exact same testimony*, at \nleast with respect to the testimony of having had this sublime, \nexistential, not only a one off spiritual experience, but a wholly life \ntransforming one, by people from every year on the calendar since ~33 AD \nuntil the present, from all over the world, from every imaginable cultural \nbackground - and this includes countless numbers who had the exact same \nexperience, but never held a holy book in their hand at any time, once in \ntheir entire life.\n\nFurther, this sort of experience, which is likely to be the inspiration \nbehind a vid like this, so these millions spanning the globe over the \nmillennia, will say, comes only from invoking Jesus, or whatever the \ntranslation of the name at whatever time, depending on the language, but it \nwould be him - the name -> the person.\n\nOf course, this extraordinary statistical phenomenon is not necessarily \ndispositive of any fact. But it should certainly raise a question of \nwhether or not it *is*, and I say should reasonably warrant further \ninvestigation, because, after all, what comes with this sort of \ntransformation is a remodeled life, and lots of good side effects, as it \nwere.\n\nFor me, having passed through that experience, almost 40 years ago, I would \nargue the christian religion must be scrapped, and the bible it has forced \nJesus into, along with religious traditions that Jesus repudiated, needs to \nbe vastly cut down in size, to more perfectly and totally focus on not just \nJesus, but what cannot be easily disputed as to what he may or may not have \nsaid and done. \n\nI have heard all the trash talk for decades. Always the same sort of \ndecadent losers with their big mouths saying the same things - about \nchristians and christianity. OK, whatever. *But*, and I have been around, I \ncannot recall where I heard a *single* person trash talk Jesus. And that \nmakes sense. He was a humble guy, cared about the poor and disenfranchised, \ngot in the face of the ruling elite and paid the price for doing so. Why he \neven cared for the losers we all know we are is really hard to say. My \nguess is there are/were only a few ppl that were worth it, but for Jesus to \nhave left himself a sitting duck like that to get killed the way he did, \nwell, that was crazy.\n\nEither way, there really is nothing to criticize about his life. I suppose \nif you read the Talmud, the jews have a few choice words against Jesus, \nbecause they blamed him for the collapse of judahism, the nightmare \nreligious system from hell that Jesus exposed. They would be the only \npeople that would really hate him, as because of him, and his exposure of \nthe judah fraud, there occurred a mass exodus from the scam, and the ruling \n\'elite\' of the day sort of ran out of ppl to rule :) awwwwwwwwwwww, isnt \nthat ashame. Today, they are back with a vengeance, and as a result of \ntheir propaganda and media we find our culture saturated with all these \nfaux atheists, and uneducated, under-educated big mouths with all the trash \ntalk about christianity, the christian religion and christians.\n\nHence, the trick is for the christians to stop being christians. drop the \nlabel. dump the religious system. re-create some \'word\' that is narrowly \nfocused on Jesus, carefully cut down to what even the most virulently evil \nslacker would simply have to stipulate to, to take the excuse away and get \nto the bottom of it all that ppl are just evil, they love evil and prefer \nit. This is our big problem.\n\nThe idea is to cut to the bottom line, are you an evil jerk that lives in \nbad faith or are you someone who respects the good and in good faith moves \nin that direction?\n\nAll the christian bashers hide behind 10,000 issues and subjects, all \nderived from the non-essential and extraneous, but they avoid the core \nissue WHO ARE YOU? GOOD or EVIL?\n\nJesus is the ultimate role model for what defines good, and good character, \nso it makes sense that we would want to train our focus on him and what he \nhad to say, so that we move in that direction as far as we are reasonably \nable, given whatever natural limitation we might have to deal with.\n\nWhen ppl trash talk Jesus, they expose themselves as lovers of evil and \ndarkness. And we all know evil ppl cause 100% of all the trouble in this \nworld.\n\nOnce Jesus is fully brought to the forefront, and forever taken out of the \nfake religion built up around him, then, finally, he can get in *your* \nface, where now you have *no* excuses, and ask you this:\n\n"Are you with me, or against me? There is *no middle ground*".\n\nTake your pick. Make the call. You are either a punk or someone who was \nworth the trouble. \n\nDo yourself a favor. Stop making excuses. Stop hiding behind false \ndichotomies. Do yourself and everybody else a favor and make the right \nchoice. The world could use one less bad faith dealer. We have far too many \nalready.'

aS'all of you are so fucking ignorant. christianity is a religion. if you \nbelieve in the church and believe in the bible then you are apart of the \nreligion. you cant just say "its not my religion its part of my \nspirituality" that is horseshit. and whats makes your "religion" any \ndifferent or anymore special from islam or hinduism or any other religion. \nnothing.'

aS'The number one cause of wildlife extinction, of any kind, is farming \nanimals. The Amazon rain forest is being destroyed in order to graze cattle \nand grow feed crops. Upwards of 100 plant and animal species are estimated \nto go extinct every day because of this.\n\nIn the US, wild predators are frequently culled to protect livestock. We \ncan stop all of this by simply switching to a vegan diet. If there is no \ndemand for meat, farmers will stop breeding livestock, and that will stop \nthe destruction of countless ecosystems.\n\nAlmost all of our water goes to the animal agriculture industry, and most \nof our food crops as well. The waste produced by cattle alone, never mind \nhogs and chickens, is the leading cause of freshwater pollution and ocean \ndead zones. Grazing cattle also takes a huge toll on the environment. \nContinuing to raise animals for food is provably unsustainable and is \ndestroying our planet before our eyes.'

aS"Corporatism or corporate welfare is the the real demon here. Where \ndemocrats and republicans alike are to blame for the disparity in wealth. \nYou can trace it back from the 60's to this very day. Both sides of the \naisle are to blame. The issue is that special interest and lobbyist help \nthe politicians become rich through programs, trade deals, new laws etc. \ntake for instance NAFTA . The north American Trade Agreement which was \nsupposed to help grow our economy and jobs. unite the North American \nContinent to become more prosperous. It was supposed to help lift mexico's \nwealth as a people to rival ours. Yet, we have rampant poverty where people \nlive in houses with no electricity running water etc. The utility cost are \ngreater than they ever want or can pay. Their kids cant even go to school \nbecause. That is just one point here. People and politicians like to guise \nwe have a capitalist/free market economy. Many on the left and right love \nto say this. which is completely false. We may have free association, \ncontracts, and exchanges, but in no way is our economy a capitalist \neconomy. We have social engineering, a planned economy, and corporatism. \nIts basically a society that is guided by the political class guised as a \ncapitalist system. Long story short leftist and even on the right all want \nthis system to continue because it is making them very wealthy and making \ntheir constituency very wealthy as well. Now, a solution. A true free \nmarket with out government subsidizes that try and control prices or fix \nprices to make it more beneficial would be a great start. Stop the federal \nreserve from its rampant corporate welfare. We continue to baby the large \nmachines that fuel this gap of income, that take their jobs over seas with \nglobalism, as this continues we will become angrier and angrier and call \nfor things like socialism. This is not the solution. The solution is to \ntake away the power of Washington that is fueling this chaotic greed and \ndestroying the very fabric of this nation. The federal reserve, the status \nquo government, social engineering, and an economy that is basically guided \nby our political class and large corporations is not for our benefit. Also \nsorry to you Bernie fans and republicans but both of those people want to \ncontinue this system one way or another. Please, educate yourselves and do \nnot fall for the fallacy that its one party or the other. Do not fall for \nsocialism. A true free market with regulation that is reasonable, take away \npower from Washington and the federal reserve, stop the \nglobalist/corporatist/planned economy and the association with our \npoliticians in the pocket of lobbyist."

The poorest of the poor \ncould be doing just fine (they\'re not, but let\'s assume) and just because \nthey\'re so much lower in the wealth category this video makes it look like \nthey\'re doing horribly. \nIf the top 20% had 20% of the wealth and the second highest had 20% and so \non, then nobody would be the "top" and everybody would be the "top" and \nthat\'s just not how it works. Sorry. Too bad.'
p419
aS'This is one of the many reasons why we need Bernie Sanders!'
p420
aS"This is THE reason why Bernie supporters are as fervent as they are. And \nuntil the underlying problem goes away, neither will they. As well they \nshouldn't."
p421
aS"if you do the math. \n1% of 300.000.000 is 3.000.000 people\nand if the total amount of money in the US is 54 trillion and the 1% has \n40% of that 54 trillion\n54.000.000.000.000 / 0.4(%) = 21.600.000.000.000\nthen you do 40% of the total money divided by the 1% (3.000.000)\n21.600.000.000 / 3.000.000 = 7.200.000 per person\nand 7.2 million dollars is not very rich in places like LA, NY, SF and \nmultiple other places\nso it is really the 0.1 and 0.01 percent that needs ''fixing''"
p422
aS"key words.. wealth ..cash ...income.. we only have 10 percent of this \nwealth talked about in CASH ..but many middle class and poor think it is \nall cash.. and if they just had there share... that isn't theirs in the \nfirst place... they would never have to work another day in their life.."
p423
aS"But don't you think a little bit of democratic socialism, just maybe, might \nnot be a bad thing right now? You know, just to balance things the fuck out \nfor a while and shift everything back downwards?\nIf I were to guess I would be in the 0%. I make something like 11,000 a \nyear. Not doing great right now. If it were not for food stamps and two \nroom mates I couldn't live on my own."

Religion as it is currently interpreted is not a strong enough \nreason for people to act moral, but the truth will give people a real \nreason to be moral. Literally everything depends on the truth, the rich \nwill probably be the last to see it but it does not matter. Google *Truth \nContest* and read the top entry called "The Present".

aS'1. The average CEO does not make 380X what the average employee makes. \nTotal fabrication. The average CEO makes less than $175,000 per year. \n2. Who is responsible for the wages of hundreds or thousands of people? A \nCEO or an actor/athlete/musician/comedian? Who do you depend on for your \nretirement (401K, IRA, etc)??? Hollywood elite, pro athletes, media elite, \nthey all make far more than the average CEO. Where\'s the outcry?\n3. Virtually every CEO, Doctor, lawyer, pro athlete, entertainer, worked \nvery hard to get what they have. When others were playing video games, \nwatching TV, or doing drugs, they were studying, inventing, reading, etc. \n4. Many of you live in the US, and could have far more than what you \ncurrently have. The opportunities abound. Even the "poor" in the US have \naccess to clean water, free healthcare, free K-12 education that is the \nenvy of most countries. Go live in a 3rd world country for a year or two, \nand learn to appreciate what you have.\n5. Greed exists at both ends of this scale. The greed of the poor is not \nmore virtuous than the greed of the rich. The poor can afford the lottery, \nbooze, nice clothing, smokes, big screen TVs, and a host of things, but \nfoolishly don\'t have anything in savings. Their spending habits are one of \nthe thieves that steals from their future, not the rich guy across town.\n6. You can\'t shun education, and then blame someone else for what you lack.\n7. Hang around poor people, and you will develop a poverty mindset. Hang \naround successful people, and you\'ll figure out a way to become successful.\n8. You can make excuses, or make a way. You can\'t do both.\n9. Life isn\'t always fair. Suck it up, and make a new life for yourself. \nStart today. \n10. Quit wasting your time on whiner videos, and invest in motivational and \neducational videos.\n11. Quit embracing the advice of your poor friends. Instead, get advice \nfrom successful folks.'

aS'+f8beenthere Wow you sure paint a pretty little picture there, but you \nforgot to examine why the majority of America\'s Poor got to be poor in the \nfirst place. Take for instance how the Big Tobacco poured millions into \nresearch to find out what chemicals to add to their cigarettes back in the \n1950\'s, chemicals that were extremely addictive that enslaved all those new \npeople buying a television set watching their nationwide filth barrage of \nlies. We were made to be the poorest of the poor by having our brains \ndestroyed before even being born. \n\nHowever, you\'d think we would now be the richest of the rich by having \ngotten our miserable selves together in a Class Action lawsuit, that is the \ntruth according to you. Well, in most states that would work, and in fact \none older woman contracted a series of 5 cancers that killed her dead, and \nshe began a lawsuit that collected her children $120,000,000; but that was \nunder Florida Law. Her children and grandchildren can use that money as a \nspringboard, as you suggest we all should do. \n\nNow my Mom died of the exact same series of cancers but since she was a \nresident of the Commonwealth of Virginia where the lawmakers down in the \nRichmond state capital decided to pass a law that no residents of Virginia \ncould sue their cash cow for killing them and otherwise deprived them of an \nactual life brimming with opportunities galore, as you seem to have \nswallowed the entire bottle of filth, we were not to receive a thing and \nnever will. \n\nSo, what did those Virginia lawmakers do with all that good will $$$ from \nBig Tobacco flowing into their coffers? Instead of finding ways to \ncompensate their victims who live here they built a big launching platform \noff the east coast that\'s probably still sitting their losing money just \nfrom the upkeep, paid for of course by Virginia taxpayers who take it in \nthe rear axle. Of course someone like you with card board for brains and a \nheart too, you\'ll say these are just examples of more "excuses". hahahaha \nYou\'re the one using the straw. \n\nNow you mentioned inventing something and yes, a housewife invented the \nWhite-Out for typewriter mistakes. She sold it eventually and made \nsomewhere in the range of $5-$10,000,000 I think it was. So where is she \nnow and what further progress did she make with that large satchel stuffed \nwith money? Well, more than likely there wasn\'t some caring lawyer to give \nher advice because that\'s what happened to the few of us who had a chance. \n\nWhy? Because our brains were halfways melted into slag by the cigarettes, \nso that when we do happen to come into some money we don\'t get help and we \ntend to spend it away poorly because quite frankly we never had money \ngrowing up, because our parents were in death throes the time of \ndowngrading towards a hospital bed with emphysema and COPD, so on & so \nforth and too busy rotting inside their skin to ever having given us \nfinancial advice. \n\nYou\'re right funny. You must be 10 years old. But eventually I got every \ndisease a person can have, from a damaged heart valve from a diet product \npurchased from GNC to meningitis and some sort of vile affliction that \nlooks like a redworm under your skin, pointy on both ends, called MRSA. \nYou\'d be hard-pressed to name something I haven\'t had, and most of them \nwere extremely deadly and most people die from them. Even the Lyme\'s I had \nfor 26 years, little microscopic boogers that permeate all through a \nperson\'s body and whenever they detect your immune system looks like it \nsees them they run hide inside the bone til it\'s safe to come out. \nApproximately 1/3 of the people who contract Lyme\'s die. \n\nAnd I should\'ve been one of them because my immune system was damaged into \nnon-function by having slurped down tobacco chemicals that leaked over into \nthe amniotic fluid for 9 months. \n\nAnd then there was that great siding Sears Roebuck was selling, made of \nasbestos. There was the little house we lived in that had the old type of \nglass fiber insulation in the walls and our unfinished attic exposed while \nI played up there sometimes. Why mister, I grew up in the Love Canal. And \nyou dare spread your litter at me, us? \n\nLet me tell you something. Once they get ya down they keep ya down and \nfigure out new fancy stuff to draw your eyes to purchase, while having been \npoisoned to the top of your head and eyelashes, hmm, it seems maybe you \nlack a lot of hormones that should be providing you enough backbone to just \nsay no to it. You see we had our own type of "Monsanto" back then called \nE.I.Dupont, and they flooded American soil with lots of solvents, like for \ncleaning gun barrels and such. It was also companies like them that began \ndestroying a few holes up in the ozone layer... \n\nI\'m 64 now so I\'ve seen a lot more done to people to keep them on their \nback in the middle of the ring for life, including myself. You sound like \nyou stepped out of Fairytale World, the world as it should be, Robin \nWilliams in a colorful paradise. \n\nBack in 2001 a dawning came to me that my so-called doctors had decided I \nwas a strong malpractice risk. In order to prevent me from calling them on \nthe mat they began giving me a sort of imitation doctoring where they \nbasically did as little as they could without showing their cards. In short \nthey were trying to kill me but in such a way it wouldn\'t look like \nmurder-by-physicians. So it was then I began looking into nutrition \nproducts to counter their passive attempts to do away with me. \n\nAnd I succeeded. Long story short I solved cancers of every kind, all the \ncirculatory diseases such as athero and arteriosclerosis, with one formula \nof three natural ingredients. I also designed engines and energy sources \nnone of which use polluting fuels, = absolutely no pollutant by-products. \nBut in your rarified state you might not be able to figure out that those \n"successful folks" you mention don\'t much want to help someone like me \ndestroy their entire stock portfolios. They also aren\'t terribly elated at \nhow many times I keep saying these innovations that can SAVE ALL MANKIND \nwere given into my mind to understand by the aid of Jesus and God\'s holy \nspirit. \n\nBut since they so much enjoyed keeping me poor to facilitate me not being a \nthreat to their ill-gotten wealths by causing the untimely:early deaths of \nall the people on this planet including little babies plus sealife and \nanimal life and sea anemones and starfish and coral reefs they thought they \nhad successfully shoveled me away into a nearby cemeteries using the \ndoctors as their Hired Assassins. \n\nSo I began asking God DO YOU WANT ME TO KEEP WRITING ABOUT THESE ENGINES? \nHis answer was yes. So I did. In fact I\'ve been writing onto the Internet \nfor 13 years nearly non-stop. I suppose they must be aghast that one man \nalone could just about solve every problem the world has but day after day \nand week after week there just didn\'t seem to be any letup on the \ntremendous outpouring of holy spirit into me so I kept solving all those \ndiseases after having designed several engine systems that do not suffer \nfrom Entropy. \n\nThey don\'t want you to have them either. They want you to be their \nspokesperson for them, extolling the system they\'re running that tried to \nkeep me contained and even dead. \n\nNo sir, it\'s your life that sucks harder to succeed than a Hoover upright. \nYou learned to live by the other man\'s rules, and that\'s fine in your one \nindividual case. It gives you a pedestal to shout down to the beaten down \nmules RUN HARDER JUMP HIGHER when in fact most everybody is fighting every \nday for their lives against diseases and disease syndromes it was given me \nto solve 4 and 8 years ago, at first more but now with just a few nutrients \nadded together. The world crying out for a better income from a broken \nsystem you in your Cracker Jack box wisdom can still be viable. \n\nYou live in the same box with everybody else. But soon Jesus will be \ndestroying the box, and that\'s when Life on Planet Dirt will begin to rock \nwith sounds of Joy. All creation will herald the destruction of those \nafflicting us with tripe like you typed above. That\'s found at Revelation \n11:18.'

p567
aS"+Helen Smith all you have provided are your perceptions (and obviously your \nperceptions are tainted by your prejudices). normal is purely subjective; \nequality dictates that all adults should have the same rights as all other \nadults (rights that already exist) which includes marriage (there is no \n'other' and 'other'); children thrive in stable 2 parent homes (regardless \nof the sex of the parents); there is no way the media presents that every \nother person is gay; those who disagree with LBGT parenting are prejudiced \nbecause there is no logical reason to be against it (but i have never seen \nanything that says that they are bigoted homophobes)."
p568
aS'+Helen Smith The "liberal left" are using the LGBT just as you\'re using the \nLGBT then.\n\nActually the LGBT are just seeking their rights as citizens and both sides \nare using them to argue for and against their particular agendas.\n\nSorry you can\'t manage to pursue your agenda without trampling on "other\'" \nrights as fellow citizens.  I know you need a scapegoat to do so.\n\n"...Seek to eliminate all notions of gender and family" is a pretty broad \nand vague claim... care to present actual facts that that\'s what\'s being \nimplemented?  Families won\'t exist?  Gender won\'t exist?  Or, are we be \npursuing a more heterogeneous and inclusive society that isn\'t built on \nyour need for the "others" you seem to feel you need?'
p569
aS'No, it\'s not you who are out to get me/us. You, LGBT? are being used as \npawns, by the liberal left. It\'s they who are "out to get us".\nIt\'s the Liberal Left, who seek to eliminate all notions of gender and \nfamily. That is why LGBT "rights" are being pushed onto society. As I \nposted earlier: what LGBTs do in their private life, is not my concern. My \nconcern is the agenda, in which LGBTs are unwitting participants.'
p570

p571

p574
aS'+Helen Smith Nonsense Helen. Your rambling 3000 word rant is completely \nirrational. Why would increased public awareness of gays create \nconfusion.....you already admit that the population of gays is \nsmall.....are you alleging that is a secret? Are you claiming that \nawareness actually makes people gay? Helen....just because the Ellen Show \nmakes YOU want to eat pussy.....that does not mean it has the same effect \non ANYONE else.\n\nLike gays....women have achieved a significant level of equality only in \nrecent years. Like gays.....this new equality was only realized after a \n"vast over representation in media, politics and society".'
p575
aS'+Helen Smith What "lie" are you being coerced to believe Helen?'
p576
aS'+Helen Smith There\'s more than one of you Helen?  Really?  That\'s a first.\n\nYou, Helen, are; factually,  a minority of one.  Always have been.  Always \nwill be.\n\nBy dint of your fallacious appeal to majority you undermine your own \nposition.\n\nYou won\'t be "coerced into believing a lie" yet will lie to coerce your \nbeliefs upon others via an appeal to majority?\n\nOf course we\'re all discriminated against, everyday... What level of \ndiscrimination suits you best Helen?  Give me some numbers and timelines \nthat you feel are justifiable.'
p577
aS'Err, I\'m an individual, yes, but I am by no means a minority of one. There \nare many others who feel as I do.\nWhat people do in their PRIVATE life is fine by me. When I am coerced into \nbelieving a lie, that\'s when I start to "discriminate". FYI, we are all \n"discriminated" against, every day. You don\'t hold the patent for that.'
p578
aS'+Helen Smith Your \'reasoning\';  it being an appeal to majority, is \ntherefore irrelevant because you\'re a minority of one yourself.\n\nWhat level of discrimination is "enough" for you to get behind?'
p579
aS'My point is to highlight that the fact that a small minority of people are \nbeing vastly over represented in media, politics and society, to such an \nextent that the average person is being led to believe that every other \nperson is LGBT.\nI, and many others, find this to be very worrying, as the concept of \ngender, and family, is being redefined to suit this small minority of \npeople.\nWe are beginning see now, that simple "Gender identity" and sexual \norientation equality, is not enough. The liberal left, openly discuss and \npropose the total elimination of all notions of gender. LGBTs and third \nwave feminists, are willing pawns of the Liberal left\'s Ideology.\nThe idea that women do not have equality (in the west) is a myth. Sure, \nthere are some isolated \'pockets\' in our society, where sexual \ndiscrimination is still prevalent, e.g, pay differences in \'high-up\' \nprofessions. I think that the forces of business and capitalism are mainly \nto blame for this discrepancy. \nOn the whole, the average western woman has equality. \nWomen have the right to vote, the right to financial independence, the \nright to justice, the right to sole parenting, the right for abortion. \nWomen now have the ability, the means, and the right to be virtually free \nof significant, avoidable, male involvement in their lives.\nOf course, many women in the middle east and Africa are very badly treated \nby their men, they must be given freedom from violence and oppression (not \ncat calling).\nWhether we like it or not, nature has appointed women as the child bearers, \nthe nurturers, and men as the hunters, the fighters.\nModern women are led to believe that they can be the hunters and fighters, \nas well as the child bearers and nurturers. The Business world and the \nnatural world do not support that belief. '

aS'+Helen Smith Women represent 51% of the population and have yet to achieve \n100% equality......your point is?'
