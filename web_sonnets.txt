			<p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/1'>I.</a></p><p>
From fairest creatures
we desire increase,<br />
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,<br />
But as the riper should by time decease,<br />
His tender heir might bear his memory:<br />
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br />
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,<br />
Making a famine where abundance lies,<br />
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:<br />
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,<br />
And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br />
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,<br />
And, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding:<br />
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,<br />
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/2'>II.</a></p><p>
When
forty winters shall besiege thy brow,<br />
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,<br />
Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,<br />
Will be a totter'd weed of small worth held: <br />
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,<br />
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days; <br />
To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,<br />
Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.<br />
How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,<br />
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine<br />
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'<br />
Proving his beauty by succession thine!<br />
This were to be new made when thou art old,<br />
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/3'>III.</a></p><p>
Look
in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest<br />
Now is the time that face should form another;<br />
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,<br />
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.<br />
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb<br />
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?<br />
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb<br />
Of his self-love, to stop posterity? <br />
Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee<br />
Calls back the lovely April of her prime;<br />
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,<br />
Despite of wrinkles, this thy golden time.<br />
But if thou live, remembered not to be,<br />
Die single and thine image dies with thee.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/4'>IV.</a></p><p>
Unthrifty loveliness,
why dost thou spend<br />
Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?<br />
Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,<br />
And being frank she lends to those are free:<br />
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse<br />
The bounteous largess given thee to give?<br />
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use<br />
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?<br />
For having traffic with thy self alone,<br />
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:<br />
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,<br />
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?<br />
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,<br />
Which, used, lives th' executor to be.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/5'>V.</a></p><p>
Those hours, that with gentle work did frame<br />
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,<br />
Will play the tyrants to the very same<br />
And that unfair which fairly doth excel;<br />
For never-resting time leads summer on<br />
To hideous winter, and confounds him there;<br />
Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,<br />
Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:<br />
Then were not summer's distillation left,<br />
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,<br />
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,<br />
Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:<br />
But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet,<br />
Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/6'>VI.</a></p><p>
Then let not winter's
ragged hand deface,<br />
In thee thy summer, ere thou be distilled:<br />
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place<br />
With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed.<br />
That use is not forbidden usury,<br />
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;<br />
That's for thy self to breed another thee,<br />
Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;<br />
Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,<br />
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:<br />
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,<br />
Leaving thee living in posterity?<br />
Be not self-willed, for thou art much too fair<br />
To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/7'>VII.</a></p><p>
Lo! in the orient when
the gracious light<br />
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye<br />
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,<br />
Serving with looks his sacred majesty; <br />
And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,<br />
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,<br />
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,<br />
Attending on his golden pilgrimage:<br />
But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,<br />
Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,<br />
The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are<br />
From his low tract, and look another way:<br />
So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon<br />
Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/8'>VIII.</a></p><p>
Music to hear, why hear'st
thou music sadly?<br />
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:<br />
Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,<br />
Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?<br />
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,<br />
By unions married, do offend thine ear,<br />
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds<br />
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear. <br />
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,<br />
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;<br />
Resembling sire and child and happy mother,<br />
Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:<br />
Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,<br />
Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.'<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/9'>IX.</a></p><p>
Is it for fear to wet
a widow's eye,<br />
That thou consum'st thy self in single life?<br />
Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,<br />
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;<br />
The world will be thy widow and still weep<br />
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,<br />
When every private widow well may keep<br />
By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:<br />
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend<br />
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;<br />
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,<br />
And kept unused the user so destroys it.<br />
No love toward others in that bosom sits<br />
That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/10'>X.</a></p><p>
For shame deny that thou
bear'st love to any,<br />
Who for thy self art so unprovident.<br />
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,<br />
But that thou none lov'st is most evident:<br />
For thou art so possessed with murderous hate,<br />
That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,<br />
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate<br />
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.<br />
O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:<br />
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?<br />
Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,<br />
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:<br />
Make thee another self for love of me,<br />
That beauty still may live in thine or thee.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/11'>XI.</a></p><p>
As fast as thou shalt
wane, so fast thou grow'st<br />
In one of thine, from that which thou departest;<br />
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,<br />
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.<br />
Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;<br />
Without this folly, age, and cold decay:<br />
If all were minded so, the times should cease<br />
And threescore year would make the world away.<br />
Let those whom nature hath not made for store,<br />
Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:<br />
Look whom she best endowed, she gave the more;<br />
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:<br />
She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,<br />
Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/12'>XII.</a></p><p>
When I do count the clock
that tells the time,<br />
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;<br />
When I behold the violet past prime,<br />
And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white; <br />
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,<br />
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,<br />
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,<br />
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,<br />
Then of thy beauty do I question make,<br />
That thou among the wastes of time must go,<br />
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake<br />
And die as fast as they see others grow;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence. <br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/13'>XIII.</a></p><p>
O! that you were your self; but, love, you are<br />
No longer yours, than you your self here live:<br />
Against this coming end you should prepare,<br />
And your sweet semblance to some other give:<br />
So should that beauty which you hold in lease<br />
Find no determination; then you were<br />
Yourself again, after yourself's decease,<br />
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear. <br />
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,<br />
Which husbandry in honour might uphold,<br />
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day<br />
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?<br />
O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,<br />
You had a father: let your son say so.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/14'>XIV.</a></p><p>
Not from the stars
do I my judgement pluck;<br />
And yet methinks I have Astronomy,<br />
But not to tell of good or evil luck,<br />
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;<br />
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,<br />
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,<br />
Or say with princes if it shall go well<br />
By oft predict that I in heaven find:<br />
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,<br />
And, constant stars, in them I read such art<br />
As truth and beauty shall together thrive,<br />
If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert; <br />
Or else of thee this I prognosticate:<br />
Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/15'>XV.</a></p><p>
When I consider every thing that grows<br />
Holds in perfection but a little moment,<br />
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows<br />
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;<br />
When I perceive that men as plants increase,<br />
Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,<br />
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,<br />
And wear their brave state out of memory;<br />
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay<br />
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,<br />
Where wasteful Time debateth with decay<br />
To change your day of youth to sullied night,<br />
And all in war with Time for love of you,<br />
As he takes from you, I engraft you new.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/16'>XVI.</a></p><p>
But wherefore do not you a mightier way<br />
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?<br />
And fortify your self in your decay<br />
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?<br />
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,<br />
And many maiden gardens, yet unset,<br />
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,<br />
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:<br />
So should the lines of life that life repair,<br />
Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,<br />
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,<br />
Can make you live your self in eyes of men.<br />
To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,<br />
And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/17'>XVII.</a></p><p>
Who will believe my verse
in time to come,<br />
If it were filled with your most high deserts?<br />
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb<br />
Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.<br />
If I could write the beauty of your eyes,<br />
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,<br />
The age to come would say 'This poet lies;<br />
Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.'<br />
So should my papers, yellowed with their age,<br />
Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,<br />
And your true rights be termed a poet's rage<br />
And stretched metre of an antique song:<br />
But were some child of yours alive that time,<br />
You should live twice, in it, and in my rhyme.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/18'>XVIII.</a></p><p>
Shall
I compare thee to
a summer's day?<br />
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br />
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br />
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:<br />
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br />
And often is his gold complexion dimmed,<br />
And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br />
By chance, or nature's changing course untrimmed:<br />
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br />
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,<br />
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,<br />
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,<br />
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br />
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/19'>XIX.</a></p><p>
Devouring Time, blunt
thou the lion's paws,<br />
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;<br />
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,<br />
And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;<br />
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st,<br />
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,<br />
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;<br />
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:<br />
O! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,<br />
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;<br />
Him in thy course untainted do allow<br />
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men. <br />
Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,<br />
My love shall in my verse ever live young.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/20'>XX.</a></p><p>
A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,<br />
Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;<br />
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted<br />
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion:<br />
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,<br />
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;<br />
A man in hue all hues in his controlling,<br />
Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.<br />
And for a woman wert thou first created;<br />
Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,<br />
And by addition me of thee defeated,<br />
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.<br />
But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,<br />
Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/21'>XXI.</a></p><p>
So is it not with me as with that Muse,<br />
Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,<br />
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use<br />
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,<br />
Making a couplement of proud compare<br />
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,<br />
With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,<br />
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.<br />
O! let me, true in love, but truly write,<br />
And then believe me, my love is as fair<br />
As any mother's child, though not so bright<br />
As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:<br />
Let them say more that like of hearsay well;<br />
I will not praise that purpose not to sell.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/22'>XXII.</a></p><p>
My glass shall not persuade
me I am old,<br />
So long as youth and thou are of one date;<br />
But when in thee time's furrows I behold,<br />
Then look I death my days should expiate. <br />
For all that beauty that doth cover thee,<br />
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,<br />
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:<br />
How can I then be elder than thou art?<br />
O! therefore, love, be of thyself so wary<br />
As I, not for myself, but for thee will;<br />
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary<br />
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.<br />
Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,<br />
Thou gav'st me thine not to give back again.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/23'>XXIII.</a></p><p>
As an unperfect actor
on the stage,<br />
Who with his fear is put beside his part,<br />
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,<br />
Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;<br />
So I, for fear of trust, forget to say<br />
The perfect ceremony of love's rite,<br />
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,<br />
O'ercharged with burthen of mine own love's might.<br />
O! let my looks be then the eloquence<br />
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,<br />
Who plead for love, and look for recompense,<br />
More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.<br />
O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:<br />
To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/24'>XXIV.</a></p><p>
Mine eye hath played the painter and hath steeled,<br />
Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;<br />
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,<br />
And perspective that is best painter's art.<br />
For through the painter must you see his skill,<br />
To find where your true image pictured lies,<br />
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,<br />
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.<br />
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:<br />
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me<br />
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun<br />
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee; <br />
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,<br />
They draw but what they see, know not the heart.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/25'>XXV.</a></p><p>
Let those who are in favour with their stars<br />
Of public honour and proud titles boast,<br />
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars<br />
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.<br />
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread<br />
But as the marigold at the sun's eye,<br />
And in themselves their pride lies buried,<br />
For at a frown they in their glory die.<br />
The painful warrior famoused for fight,<br />
After a thousand victories once foiled,<br />
Is from the book of honour razed quite,<br />
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:<br />
Then happy I, that love and am beloved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I may not remove nor be removed.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/26'>XXVI.</a></p><p>
Lord of my love, to whom
in vassalage<br />
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,<br />
To thee I send this written embassage,<br />
To witness duty, not to show my wit:<br />
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine<br />
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,<br />
But that I hope some good conceit of thine<br />
In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:<br />
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,<br />
Points on me graciously with fair aspect,<br />
And puts apparel on my tottered loving,<br />
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:<br />
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;<br />
Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/27'>XXVII.</a></p><p>
Weary with toil, I haste
me to my bed,<br />
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;<br />
But then begins a journey in my head<br />
To work my mind, when body's work's expired: <br />
For then my thoughts--from far where I abide--<br />
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,<br />
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,<br />
Looking on darkness which the blind do see:<br />
Save that my soul's imaginary sight<br />
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,<br />
Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,<br />
Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.<br />
Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,<br />
For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/28'>XXVIII.</a></p><p>
How can I then return
in happy plight,<br />
That am debarred the benefit of rest?<br />
When day's oppression is not eas'd by night,<br />
But day by night and night by day oppressed,<br />
And each, though enemies to either's reign,<br />
Do in consent shake hands to torture me,<br />
The one by toil, the other to complain<br />
How far I toil, still farther off from thee. <br />
I tell the day, to please him thou art bright,<br />
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:<br />
So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,<br />
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.<br />
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,<br />
And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/29'>XXIX.</a></p><p>
When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes<br />
I all alone beweep my outcast state,<br />
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,<br />
And look upon myself, and curse my fate,<br />
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,<br />
Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,<br />
Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,<br />
With what I most enjoy contented least;<br />
Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,<br />
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,<br />
Like to the lark at break of day arising<br />
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;<br />
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings<br />
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/30'>XXX.</a></p><p>
When
to the sessions of sweet silent thought<br />
I summon up remembrance of things past,<br />
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,<br />
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:<br />
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,<br />
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,<br />
And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,<br />
And moan the expense of many a vanished sight:<br />
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,<br />
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er<br />
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,<br />
Which I new pay as if not paid before.<br />
But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,<br />
All losses are restor'd and sorrows end.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/31'>XXXI.</a></p><p>
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,<br />
Which I by lacking have supposed dead;<br />
And there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts,<br />
And all those friends which I thought buried.<br />
How many a holy and obsequious tear<br />
Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,<br />
As interest of the dead, which now appear<br />
But things removed that hidden in thee lie!<br />
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,<br />
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,<br />
Who all their parts of me to thee did give,<br />
That due of many now is thine alone:<br />
Their images I loved, I view in thee,<br />
And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/32'>XXXII.</a></p><p>
If thou survive my well-contented
day,<br />
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover<br />
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey<br />
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,<br />
Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,<br />
And though they be outstripped by every pen,<br />
Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,<br />
Exceeded by the height of happier men.<br />
O! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:<br />
'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,<br />
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,<br />
To march in ranks of better equipage:<br />
But since he died and poets better prove,<br />
Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.<br />

Full many a glorious morning
have I seen<br />
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,<br />
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,<br />
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;<br />
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride<br />
With ugly rack on his celestial face,<br />
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,<br />
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace: <br />
Even so my sun one early morn did shine,<br />
With all triumphant splendour on my brow;<br />
But out, alack, he was but one hour mine,<br />
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.<br />
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;<br />
Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/34'>XXXIV.</a></p><p>
Why didst thou promise
such a beauteous day,<br />
And make me travel forth without my cloak,<br />
To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,<br />
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?<br />
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,<br />
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,<br />
For no man well of such a salve can speak,<br />
That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:<br />
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;<br />
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:<br />
The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief<br />
To him that bears the strong offence's cross. <br />
Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,<br />
And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/35'>XXXV.</a></p><p>
No more be grieved atthat which thou hast done:<br />
Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:<br />
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,<br />
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.<br />
All men make faults, and even I in this,<br />
Authorizing thy trespass with compare,<br />
Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,<br />
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;<br />
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,<br />
Thy adverse party is thy advocate,<br />
And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:<br />
Such civil war is in my love and hate,<br />
That I an accessary needs must be,<br />
To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/36'>XXXVI.</a></p><p>
Let me confess that we
two must be twain,<br />
Although our undivided loves are one:<br />
So shall those blots that do with me remain,<br />
Without thy help, by me be borne alone.<br />
In our two loves there is but one respect,<br />
Though in our lives a separable spite,<br />
Which though it alter not love's sole effect,<br />
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.<br />
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,<br />
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,<br />
Nor thou with public kindness honour me,<br />
Unless thou take that honour from thy name:<br />
But do not so, I love thee in such sort,<br />
As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/37'>XXXVII.</a></p><p>
As a decrepit father takes
delight<br />
To see his active child do deeds of youth,<br />
So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite,<br />
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth; <br />
For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,<br />
Or any of these all, or all, or more,<br />
Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,<br />
I make my love engrafted to this store:<br />
So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,<br />
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give<br />
That I in thy abundance am sufficed,<br />
And by a part of all thy glory live.<br />
Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:<br />
This wish I have; then ten times happy me!<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/38'>XXXVIII.</a></p><p>
How can my muse want subject
to invent,<br />
While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse<br />
Thine own sweet argument, too excellent<br />
For every vulgar paper to rehearse?<br />
O! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me<br />
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;<br />
For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,<br />
When thou thy self dost give invention light? <br />
Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth<br />
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;<br />
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth<br />
Eternal numbers to outlive long date.<br />
If my slight muse do please these curious days,<br />
The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/39'>XXXIX.</a></p><p>
O! how thy worth with manners may I sing,<br />
When thou art all the better part of me?<br />
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?<br />
And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?<br />
Even for this, let us divided live,<br />
And our dear love lose name of single one,<br />
That by this separation I may give<br />
That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone.<br />
O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,<br />
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,<br />
To entertain the time with thoughts of love,<br />
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive, <br />
And that thou teachest how to make one twain,<br />
By praising him here who doth hence remain.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/40'>XL.</a></p><p>
Take all my loves, my
love, yea take them all;<br />
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?<br />
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;<br />
All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more.<br />
Then, if for my love, thou my love receivest,<br />
I cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest;<br />
But yet be blam'd, if thou thy self deceivest<br />
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.<br />
I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,<br />
Although thou steal thee all my poverty:<br />
And yet, love knows it is a greater grief<br />
To bear love's wrong, than hate's known injury.<br />
Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,<br />
Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/41'>XLI.</a></p><p>
Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,<br />
When I am sometime absent from thy heart,<br />
Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,<br />
For still temptation follows where thou art.<br />
Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,<br />
Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed;<br />
And when a woman woos, what woman's son<br />
Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?<br />
Ay me! but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,<br />
And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth,<br />
Who lead thee in their riot even there<br />
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine by thy beauty being false to me.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/42'>XLII.</a></p><p>
That thou hast her it is not all my grief,<br />
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;<br />
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,<br />
A loss in love that touches me more nearly. <br />
Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye:<br />
Thou dost love her, because thou know'st I love her;<br />
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,<br />
Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.<br />
If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,<br />
And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;<br />
Both find each other, and I lose both twain,<br />
And both for my sake lay on me this cross:<br />
But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;<br />
Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/43'>XLIII.</a></p><p>
When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,<br />
For all the day they view things unrespected;<br />
But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,<br />
And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.<br />
Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,<br />
How would thy shadow's form form happy show<br />
To the clear day with thy much clearer light,<br />
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so! <br />
How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made<br />
By looking on thee in the living day,<br />
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade<br />
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!<br />
All days are nights to see till I see thee,<br />
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/44'>XLIV.</a></p><p>
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,<br />
Injurious distance should not stop my way;<br />
For then despite of space I would be brought, <br />
From limits far remote, where thou dost stay. <br />
No matter then although my foot did stand <br />
Upon the farthest earth removed from thee; <br />
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land <br />
As soon as think the place where he would be. <br />
But ah! thought kills me that I am not thought, <br />
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone, <br />
But that, so much of earth and water wrought,<br />
I must attend time's leisure with my moan, <br />
Receiving nought by elements so slow<br />
But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/45'>XLV.</a></p><p>
The other two, slight air and purging fire, <br />
Are both with thee, wherever I abide; <br />
The first my thought, the other my desire, <br />
These present-absent with swift motion slide. <br />
For when these quicker elements are gone <br />
In tender embassy of love to thee, <br />
My life, being made of four, with two alone <br />
Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy; <br />
Until life's composition be recured <br />
By those swift messengers return'd from thee, <br />
Who even but now come back again, assured <br />
Of thy fair health, recounting it to me: <br />
This told, I joy; but then no longer glad, <br />
I send them back again and straight grow sad.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/46'>XLVI.</a></p><p>
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,<br />
How to divide the conquest of thy sight;<br />
Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,<br />
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.<br />
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,<br />
A closet never pierced with crystal eyes,<br />
But the defendant doth that plea deny,<br />
And says in him thy fair appearance lies.<br />
To 'cide this title is impannelled<br />
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;<br />
And by their verdict is determined<br />
The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As thus: mine eye's due is thine outward part,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And my heart's right, thine inward love of heart.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/47'>XLVII.</a></p><p>
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,<br />
And each doth good turns now unto the other:<br />
When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,<br />
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,<br />
With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,<br />
And to the painted banquet bids my heart;<br />
Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,<br />
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:<br />
So, either by thy picture or my love,<br />
Thy self away, art present still with me;<br />
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,<br />
And I am still with them, and they with thee;<br />
Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight<br />
Awakes my heart, to heart's and eyes' delight.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/48'>XLVIII.</a></p><p>
How careful was I when
I
took my way,<br />
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,<br />
That to my use it might unused stay<br />
From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!<br />
But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,<br />
Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,<br />
Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,<br />
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief. <br />
Thee have I not locked up in any chest,<br />
Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,<br />
Within the gentle closure of my breast,<br />
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/49'>XLIX.</a></p><p>
Against that time, if ever that time come,<br />
When I shall see thee frown on my defects,<br />
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,<br />
Called to that audit by advis'd respects;<br />
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,<br />
And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,<br />
When love, converted from the thing it was,<br />
Shall reasons find of settled gravity;<br />
Against that time do I ensconce me here,<br />
Within the knowledge of mine own desert,<br />
And this my hand, against my self uprear,<br />
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part: <br />
To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,<br />
Since why to love I can allege no cause.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/50'>L.</a></p><p>
How heavy do I journey on the way,<br />
When what I seek, my weary travel's end,<br />
Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,<br />
'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'<br />
The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,<br />
Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,<br />
As if by some instinct the wretch did know<br />
His rider lov'd not speed being made from thee.<br />
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,<br />
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,<br />
Which heavily he answers with a groan,<br />
More sharp to me than spurring to his side;<br />
For that same groan doth put this in my mind,<br />
My grief lies onward, and my joy behind.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/51'>LI.</a></p><p>
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence<br />
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:<br />
From where thou art why should I haste me thence?<br />
Till I return, of posting is no need.<br />
O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,<br />
When swift extremity can seem but slow?<br />
Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,<br />
In winged speed no motion shall I know,<br />
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace.<br />
Therefore desire, (of perfect'st love being made)<br />
Shall neigh, no dull flesh, in his fiery race;<br />
But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade-<br />
Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,<br />
Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/52'>LII.</a></p><p>
So am I as the rich, whose blessed key,<br />
Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,<br />
The which he will not every hour survey,<br />
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure. <br />
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,<br />
Since, seldom coming in the long year set,<br />
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,<br />
Or captain jewels in the carcanet.<br />
So is the time that keeps you as my chest,<br />
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,<br />
To make some special instant special-blest,<br />
By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.<br />
Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,<br />
Being had, to triumph, being lacked, to hope.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/53'>LIII.</a></p><p>
What is your substance,
whereof are you made,<br />
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?<br />
Since every one hath, every one, one shade,<br />
And you but one, can every shadow lend.<br />
Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit<br />
Is poorly imitated after you;<br />
On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,<br />
And you in Grecian tires are painted new: <br />
Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,<br />
The one doth shadow of your beauty show,<br />
The other as your bounty doth appear;<br />
And you in every blessed shape we know.<br />
In all external grace you have some part,<br />
But you like none, none you, for constant heart.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/54'>LIV.</a></p><p>
O! how much more doth
beauty beauteous seem<br />
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.<br />
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem<br />
For that sweet odour, which doth in it live.<br />
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye<br />
As the perfumed tincture of the roses,<br />
Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly<br />
When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:<br />
But, for their virtue only is their show,<br />
They live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade;<br />
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;<br />
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made: <br />
And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,<br />
When that shall vade, my verse distills your truth.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/55'>LV.</a></p><p>
Not marble, nor the gilded
monuments<br />
Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;<br />
But you shall shine more bright in these contents<br />
Than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time.<br />
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,<br />
And broils root out the work of masonry,<br />
Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn<br />
The living record of your memory.<br />
'Gainst death, and all oblivious enmity<br />
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room<br />
Even in the eyes of all posterity<br />
That wear this world out to the ending doom.<br />
So, till the judgment that yourself arise,<br />
You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/56'>LVI.</a></p><p>
Sweet love, renew thy
force; be it not said<br />
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,<br />
Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,<br />
To-morrow sharpened in his former might:<br />
So, love, be thou, although to-day thou fill<br />
Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,<br />
To-morrow see again, and do not kill<br />
The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.<br />
Let this sad interim like the ocean be<br />
Which parts the shore, where two contracted new<br />
Come daily to the banks, that when they see<br />
Return of love, more blest may be the view;<br />
As call it winter, which being full of care,<br />
Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/57'>LVII.</a></p><p>
Being your slave what
should I do but tend<br />
Upon the hours, and times of your desire?<br />
I have no precious time at all to spend;<br />
Nor services to do, till you require. <br />
Nor dare I chide the world without end hour,<br />
Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,<br />
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,<br />
When you have bid your servant once adieu;<br />
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought<br />
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,<br />
But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought<br />
Save, where you are, how happy you make those.<br />
So true a fool is love, that in your will,<br />
Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/58'>LVIII.</a></p><p>
That god forbid, that made me first your slave,<br />
I should in thought control your times of pleasure,<br />
Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,<br />
Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!<br />
O! let me suffer, being at your beck,<br />
The imprison'd absence of your liberty;<br />
And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,<br />
Without accusing you of injury. <br />
Be where you list, your charter is so strong<br />
That you yourself may privilege your time<br />
To what you will; to you it doth belong<br />
Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.<br />
I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,<br />
Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/59'>LIX.</a></p><p>
If there be nothing new, but that which is<br />
Hath been before, how are our brains beguil'd,<br />
Which labouring for invention bear amiss<br />
The second burthen of a former child.<br />
Oh that record could with a backward look,<br />
Even of five hundred courses of the sun,<br />
Show me your image in some antique book,<br />
Since mind at first in character was done,<br />
That I might see what the old world could say<br />
To this composed wonder of your frame;<br />
Whether we are mended, or where better they,<br />
Or whether revolution be the same. <br />
Oh sure I am the wits of former days,<br />
To subjects worse have given admiring praise.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/60'>LX.</a></p><p>
Like as the waves make
towards the pebbled shore,<br />
So do our minutes hasten to their end;<br />
Each changing place with that which goes before,<br />
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.<br />
Nativity, once in the main of light,<br />
Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,<br />
Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,<br />
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.<br />
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth<br />
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,<br />
Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,<br />
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:<br />
And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand<br />
Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/61'>LXI.</a></p><p>
Is it thy will, thy image
should keep open<br />
My heavy eyelids to the weary night?<br />
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,<br />
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?<br />
Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee<br />
So far from home into my deeds to pry,<br />
To find out shames and idle hours in me,<br />
The scope and tenor of thy jealousy?<br />
O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:<br />
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:<br />
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,<br />
To play the watchman ever for thy sake:<br />
For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,<br />
From me far off, with others all too near.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/62'>LXII.</a></p><p>
Sin of self-love possesseth
all mine eye<br />
And all my soul, and all my every part;<br />
And for this sin there is no remedy,<br />
It is so grounded inward in my heart.<br />
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,<br />
No shape so true, no truth of such account;<br />
And for myself mine own worth do define,<br />
As I all other in all worths surmount.<br />
But when my glass shows me myself indeed<br />
Beated and chopp'd with tanned antiquity,<br />
Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;<br />
Self so self-loving were iniquity.<br />
'Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,<br />
Painting my age with beauty of thy days.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/63'>LXIII.</a></p><p>
Against my love shall be as I am now,<br />
With Time's injurious hand crushed and o'erworn;<br />
When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow<br />
With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn<br />
Hath travelled on to age's steepy night;<br />
And all those beauties whereof now he's king<br />
Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,<br />
Stealing away the treasure of his spring; <br />
For such a time do I now fortify<br />
Against confounding age's cruel knife,<br />
That he shall never cut from memory<br />
My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:<br />
His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,<br />
And they shall live, and he in them still green.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/64'>LXIV.</a></p><p>
When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced<br />
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;<br />
When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed,<br />
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;<br />
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain<br />
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,<br />
And the firm soil win of the watery main,<br />
Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;<br />
When I have seen such interchange of state,<br />
Or state itself confounded to decay;<br />
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate <br />
That Time will come and take my love away. <br />
This thought is as a death which cannot choose<br />
But weep to have that which it fears to lose.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/65'>LXV.</a></p><p>
Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,<br />
But sad mortality o'ersways their power,<br />
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,<br />
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?<br />
O! how shall summer's honey breath hold out,<br />
Against the wrackful siege of battering days,<br />
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,<br />
Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays?<br />
O fearful meditation! where, alack,<br />
Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?<br />
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?<br />
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?<br />
O! none, unless this miracle have might,<br />
That in black ink my love may still shine bright.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/66'>LXVI.</a></p><p>
Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,<br />
As to behold desert a beggar born,<br />
And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,<br />
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,<br />
And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,<br />
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,<br />
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,<br />
And strength by limping sway disabled<br />
And art made tongue-tied by authority,<br />
And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,<br />
And simple truth miscalled simplicity,<br />
And captive good attending captain ill:<br />
Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,<br />
Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/67'>LXVII.</a></p><p>
Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,<br />
And with his presence grace impiety,<br />
That sin by him advantage should achieve,<br />
And lace itself with his society? <br />
Why should false painting imitate his cheek,<br />
And steal dead seeming of his living hue?<br />
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek<br />
Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?<br />
Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,<br />
Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins?<br />
For she hath no exchequer now but his,<br />
And proud of many, lives upon his gains.<br />
O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had<br />
In days long since, before these last so bad.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/68'>LXVIII.</a></p><p>
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,<br />
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,<br />
Before these bastard signs of fair were born,<br />
Or durst inhabit on a living brow;<br />
Before the golden tresses of the dead,<br />
The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,<br />
To live a second life on second head;<br />
Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:<br />
In him those holy antique hours are seen,<br />
Without all ornament, itself and true,<br />
Making no summer of another's green,<br />
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;<br />
And him as for a map doth Nature store,<br />
To show false Art what beauty was of yore.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/69'>LXIX.</a></p><p>
Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view<br />
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;<br />
All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,<br />
Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.<br />
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;<br />
But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,<br />
In other accents do this praise confound<br />
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.<br />
They look into the beauty of thy mind,<br />
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds;<br />
Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,<br />
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds: <br />
But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,<br />
The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/70'>LXX.</a></p><p>
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,<br />
For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;<br />
The ornament of beauty is suspect,<br />
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.<br />
So thou be good, slander doth but approve<br />
Thy worth the greater, being wooed of time;<br />
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,<br />
And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.<br />
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days<br />
Either not assailed, or victor being charged;<br />
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,<br />
To tie up envy, evermore enlarged,<br />
If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,<br />
Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/71'>LXXI.</a></p><p>
No longer mourn for me when I am dead<br />
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell<br />
Give warning to the world that I am fled<br />
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:<br />
Nay, if you read this line, remember not<br />
The hand that writ it, for I love you so,<br />
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,<br />
If thinking on me then should make you woe.<br />
O! if, I say, you look upon this verse,<br />
When I perhaps compounded am with clay,<br />
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;<br />
But let your love even with my life decay;<br />
Lest the wise world should look into your moan,<br />
And mock you with me after I am gone.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/72'>LXXII.</a></p><p>
O! lest the world should task you to recite<br />
What merit lived in me, that you should love<br />
After my death,--dear love, forget me quite,<br />
For you in me can nothing worthy prove.<br />
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,<br />
To do more for me than mine own desert,<br />
And hang more praise upon deceased I<br />
Than niggard truth would willingly impart:<br />
O! lest your true love may seem false in this<br />
That you for love speak well of me untrue,<br />
My name be buried where my body is,<br />
And live no more to shame nor me nor you.<br />
For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,<br />
And so should you, to love things nothing worth.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/73'>LXXIII.</a></p><p>
That time of year thou mayst in me behold<br />
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang<br />
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,<br />
Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.<br />
In me thou see'st the twilight of such day<br />
As after sunset fadeth in the west;<br />
Which by and by black night doth take away,<br />
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest. <br />
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,<br />
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,<br />
As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,<br />
Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.<br />
This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,<br />
To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/74'>LXXIV.</a></p><p>
But be contented when that fell arrest<br />
Without all bail shall carry me away,<br />
My life hath in this line some interest,<br />
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.<br />
When thou reviewest this, thou dost review<br />
The very part was consecrate to thee:<br />
The earth can have but earth, which is his due;<br />
My spirit is thine, the better part of me:<br />
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,<br />
The prey of worms, my body being dead;<br />
The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,<br />
Too base of thee to be remembered.<br />
The worth of that is that which it contains,<br />
And that is this, and this with thee remains.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/75'>LXXV.</a></p><p>
So are you to my thoughts as food to life,<br />
Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;<br />
And for the peace of you I hold such strife<br />
As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.<br />
Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon<br />
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;<br />
Now counting best to be with you alone,<br />
Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure:<br />
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,<br />
And by and by clean starved for a look;<br />
Possessing or pursuing no delight<br />
Save what is had, or must from you be took.<br />
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,<br />
Or gluttoning on all, or all away.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/76'>LXXVI.</a></p><p>
Why is my verse so barren of new pride,<br />
So far from variation or quick change?<br />
Why with the time do I not glance aside<br />
To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?<br />
Why write I still all one, ever the same,<br />
And keep invention in a noted weed,<br />
That every word doth almost tell my name,<br />
Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?<br />
O! know sweet love I always write of you,<br />
And you and love are still my argument;<br />
So all my best is dressing old words new,<br />
Spending again what is already spent:<br />
For as the sun is daily new and old,<br />
So is my love still telling what is told.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/77'>LXXVII.</a></p><p>
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,<br />
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;<br />
The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,<br />
And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste. <br />
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show<br />
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;<br />
Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know<br />
Time's thievish progress to eternity.<br />
Look what thy memory cannot contain,<br />
Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find<br />
Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,<br />
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.<br />
These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,<br />
Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/78'>LXXVIII.</a></p><p>
So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,<br />
And found such fair assistance in my verse<br />
As every alien pen hath got my use<br />
And under thee their poesy disperse.<br />
Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing<br />
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,<br />
Have added feathers to the learned's wing<br />
And given grace a double majesty.<br />
Yet be most proud of that which I compile,<br />
Whose influence is thine, and born of thee:<br />
In others' works thou dost but mend the style,<br />
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;<br />
But thou art all my art, and dost advance<br />
As high as learning, my rude ignorance.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/79'>LXXIX.</a></p><p>
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,<br />
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;<br />
But now my gracious numbers are decayed,<br />
And my sick Muse doth give an other place.<br />
I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument<br />
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;<br />
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent<br />
He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.<br />
He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word<br />
From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,<br />
And found it in thy cheek: he can afford<br />
No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live. <br />
Then thank him not for that which he doth say,<br />
Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/80'>LXXX.</a></p><p>
O! how I faint when I of you do write,<br />
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,<br />
And in the praise thereof spends all his might,<br />
To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.<br />
But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,<br />
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,<br />
My saucy bark, inferior far to his,<br />
On your broad main doth wilfully appear.<br />
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,<br />
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;<br />
Or, being wracked, I am a worthless boat,<br />
He of tall building, and of goodly pride:<br />
Then if he thrive and I be cast away,<br />
The worst was this, my love was my decay.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/81'>LXXXI.</a></p><p>
Or I shall live your epitaph to make,<br />
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten,<br />
From hence your memory death cannot take,<br />
Although in me each part will be forgotten.<br />
Your name from hence immortal life shall have,<br />
Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:<br />
The earth can yield me but a common grave,<br />
When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.<br />
Your monument shall be my gentle verse,<br />
Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read;<br />
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse,<br />
When all the breathers of this world are dead;<br />
You still shall live, such virtue hath my pen,<br />
Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/82'>LXXXII.</a></p><p>
I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,<br />
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook<br />
The dedicated words which writers use<br />
Of their fair subject, blessing every book. <br />
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,<br />
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise;<br />
And therefore art enforced to seek anew<br />
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.<br />
And do so, love; yet when they have devised,<br />
What strained touches rhetoric can lend,<br />
Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized<br />
In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;<br />
And their gross painting might be better used<br />
Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/83'>LXXXIII.</a></p><p>
I never saw that you did painting need,<br />
And therefore to your fair no painting set;<br />
I found, or thought I found, you did exceed<br />
The barren tender of a poet's debt:<br />
And therefore have I slept in your report,<br />
That you yourself, being extant, well might show<br />
How far a modern quill doth come too short,<br />
Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow. <br />
This silence for my sin you did impute,<br />
Which shall be most my glory being dumb;<br />
For I impair not beauty being mute,<br />
When others would give life, and bring a tomb.<br />
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes<br />
Than both your poets can in praise devise.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/84'>LXXXIV.</a></p><p>
Who is it that says most, which can say more,<br />
Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you,<br />
In whose confine immured is the store<br />
Which should example where your equal grew?<br />
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell<br />
That to his subject lends not some small glory;<br />
But he that writes of you, if he can tell<br />
That you are you, so dignifies his story.<br />
Let him but copy what in you is writ,<br />
Not making worse what nature made so clear,<br />
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,<br />
Making his style admired every where.<br />
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,<br />
Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/85'>LXXXV.</a></p><p>
My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,<br />
While comments of your praise richly compiled,<br />
Reserve thy character with golden quill,<br />
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.<br />
I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,<br />
And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen'<br />
To every hymn that able spirit affords,<br />
In polished form of well-refined pen.<br />
Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,'<br />
And to the most of praise add something more;<br />
But that is in my thought, whose love to you,<br />
Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.<br />
Then others, for the breath of words respect,<br />
Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/86'>LXXXVI.</a></p><p>
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,<br />
Bound for the prize of all too precious you,<br />
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,<br />
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?<br />
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write<br />
Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?<br />
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night<br />
Giving him aid, my verse astonished.<br />
He, nor that affable familiar ghost<br />
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,<br />
As victors of my silence cannot boast;<br />
I was not sick of any fear from thence:<br />
But when your countenance filled up his line,<br />
Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/87'>LXXXVII.</a></p><p>
Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,<br />
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,<br />
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;<br />
My bonds in thee are all determinate.<br />
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?<br />
And for that riches where is my deserving?<br />
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,<br />
And so my patent back again is swerving.<br />
Thy self thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing,<br />
Or me to whom thou gav'st it else mistaking;<br />
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,<br />
Comes home again, on better judgement making.<br />
Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,<br />
In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/88'>LXXXVIII.</a></p><p>
When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,<br />
And place my merit in the eye of scorn,<br />
Upon thy side, against myself I'll fight,<br />
And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.<br />
With mine own weakness being best acquainted,<br />
Upon thy part I can set down a story<br />
Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted;<br />
That thou in losing me shalt win much glory: <br />
And I by this will be a gainer too;<br />
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,<br />
The injuries that to myself I do,<br />
Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.<br />
Such is my love, to thee I so belong,<br />
That for thy right, myself will bear all wrong.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/89'>LXXXIX.</a></p><p>
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,<br />
And I will comment upon that offence:<br />
Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,<br />
Against thy reasons making no defence.<br />
Thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,<br />
To set a form upon desired change,<br />
As I'll myself disgrace; knowing thy will,<br />
I will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;<br />
Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue<br />
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,<br />
Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,<br />
And haply of our old acquaintance tell. <br />
For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,<br />
For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/90'>XC.</a></p><p>
Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;<br />
Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,<br />
Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,<br />
And do not drop in for an after-loss:<br />
Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,<br />
Come in the rearward of a conquered woe;<br />
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,<br />
To linger out a purposed overthrow.<br />
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,<br />
When other petty griefs have done their spite,<br />
But in the onset come: so shall I taste<br />
At first the very worst of fortune's might;<br />
And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,<br />
Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/91'>XCI.</a></p><p>
Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,<br />
Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,<br />
Some in their garments though new-fangled ill;<br />
Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;<br />
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,<br />
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:<br />
But these particulars are not my measure,<br />
All these I better in one general best.<br />
Thy love is better than high birth to me,<br />
Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,<br />
Of more delight than hawks and horses be;<br />
And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:<br />
Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take<br />
All this away, and me most wretched make.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/92'>XCII.</a></p><p>
But do thy worst to steal thyself away,<br />
For term of life thou art assured mine;<br />
And life no longer than thy love will stay,<br />
For it depends upon that love of thine. <br />
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,<br />
When in the least of them my life hath end.<br />
I see a better state to me belongs<br />
Than that which on thy humour doth depend:<br />
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,<br />
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.<br />
O what a happy title do I find,<br />
Happy to have thy love, happy to die!<br />
But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?<br />
Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/93'>XCIII.</a></p><p>
So shall I live, supposing thou art true,<br />
Like a deceived husband; so love's face<br />
May still seem love to me, though altered new;<br />
Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:<br />
For there can live no hatred in thine eye,<br />
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.<br />
In many's looks, the false heart's history<br />
Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange. <br />
But heaven in thy creation did decree<br />
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;<br />
Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,<br />
Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.<br />
How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,<br />
If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/94'>XCIV.</a></p><p>
They that have power to hurt, and will do none,<br />
That do not do the thing they most do show,<br />
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,<br />
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;<br />
They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,<br />
And husband nature's riches from expense;<br />
They are the lords and owners of their faces,<br />
Others, but stewards of their excellence.<br />
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,<br />
Though to itself, it only live and die,<br />
But if that flower with base infection meet,<br />
The basest weed outbraves his dignity: <br />
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;<br />
Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/95'>XCV.</a></p><p>
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame<br />
Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,<br />
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!<br />
O! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose.<br />
That tongue that tells the story of thy days,<br />
Making lascivious comments on thy sport,<br />
Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise;<br />
Naming thy name blesses an ill report.<br />
O! what a mansion have those vices got<br />
Which for their habitation chose out thee,<br />
Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot<br />
And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!<br />
Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;<br />
The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/96'>XCVI.</a></p><p>
Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;<br />
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;<br />
Both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less:<br />
Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.<br />
As on the finger of a throned queen<br />
The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,<br />
So are those errors that in thee are seen<br />
To truths translated, and for true things deem'd.<br />
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,<br />
If like a lamb he could his looks translate!<br />
How many gazers mightst thou lead away,<br />
If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!<br />
But do not so, I love thee in such sort,<br />
As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/97'>XCVII.</a></p><p>
How like a winter hath my absence been<br />
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!<br />
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!<br />
What old December's bareness everywhere! <br />
And yet this time removed was summer's time;<br />
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,<br />
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,<br />
Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:<br />
Yet this abundant issue seemed to me<br />
But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit;<br />
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,<br />
And, thou away, the very birds are mute:<br />
Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,<br />
That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/98'>XCVIII.</a></p><p>
From you have I been absent in the spring,<br />
When proud pied April, dressed in all his trim,<br />
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,<br />
That heavy Saturn laughed and leapt with him.<br />
Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell<br />
Of different flowers in odour and in hue,<br />
Could make me any summer's story tell,<br />
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew: <br />
Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,<br />
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;<br />
They were but sweet, but figures of delight,<br />
Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.<br />
Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,<br />
As with your shadow I with these did play.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/99'>XCIX.</a></p><p>
The forward violet thus did I chide:<br />
Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,<br />
If not from my love's breath? The purple pride<br />
Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells<br />
In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd.<br />
The lily I condemned for thy hand,<br />
And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair;<br />
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,<br />
One blushing shame, another white despair;<br />
A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both,<br />
And to his robbery had annexed thy breath;<br />
But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth <br />
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.<br />
More flowers I noted, yet I none could see, <br />
But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/100'>C.</a></p><p>
Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,<br />
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?<br />
Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,<br />
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?<br />
Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,<br />
In gentle numbers time so idly spent;<br />
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem<br />
And gives thy pen both skill and argument.<br />
Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,<br />
If Time have any wrinkle graven there;<br />
If any, be a satire to decay,<br />
And make Time's spoils despised every where.<br />
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,<br />
So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/101'>CI.</a></p><p>
O truant Muse what shall be thy amends<br />
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?<br />
Both truth and beauty on my love depends;<br />
So dost thou too, and therein dignified.<br />
Make answer Muse: wilt thou not haply say,<br />
'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fixed;<br />
Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;<br />
But best is best, if never intermixed'?<br />
Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?<br />
Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee<br />
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb<br />
And to be praised of ages yet to be.<br />
Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how<br />
To make him seem, long hence, as he shows now.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/102'>CII.</a></p><p>
My love is strengthened, though more weak in seeming;<br />
I love not less, though less the show appear;<br />
That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,<br />
The owner's tongue doth publish every where.<br />
Our love was new, and then but in the spring,<br />
When I was wont to greet it with my lays;<br />
As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,<br />
And stops his pipe in growth of riper days:<br />
Not that the summer is less pleasant now<br />
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,<br />
But that wild music burthens every bough,<br />
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.<br />
Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:<br />
Because I would not dull you with my song.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/103'>CIII.</a></p><p>
Alack! what poverty my Muse brings forth,<br />
That having such a scope to show her pride,<br />
The argument all bare is of more worth<br />
Than when it hath my added praise beside!<br />
O! blame me not, if I no more can write!<br />
Look in your glass, and there appears a face<br />
That over-goes my blunt invention quite, <br />
Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.<br />
Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,<br />
To mar the subject that before was well?<br />
For to no other pass my verses tend<br />
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;<br />
And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,<br />
Your own glass shows you when you look in it.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/104'>CIV.</a></p><p>
To me, fair friend, you never can be old,<br />
For as you were when first your eye I ey'd,<br />
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,<br />
Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,<br />
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,<br />
In process of the seasons have I seen,<br />
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,<br />
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.<br />
Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,<br />
Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;<br />
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,<br />
Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived:<br />
For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:<br />
Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/105'>CV.</a></p><p>
Let not my love be called idolatry,<br />
Nor my beloved as an idol show,<br />
Since all alike my songs and praises be<br />
To one, of one, still such, and ever so.<br />
Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,<br />
Still constant in a wondrous excellence;<br />
Therefore my verse to constancy confined,<br />
One thing expressing, leaves out difference.<br />
Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,<br />
Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words;<br />
And in this change is my invention spent,<br />
Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.<br />
Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone,<br />
Which three till now, never kept seat in one.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/106'>CVI.</a></p><p>
When in the chronicle of wasted time<br />
I see descriptions of the fairest wights,<br />
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,<br />
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,<br />
Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,<br />
Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,<br />
I see their antique pen would have expressed<br />
Even such a beauty as you master now.<br />
So all their praises are but prophecies<br />
Of this our time, all you prefiguring;<br />
And for they looked but with divining eyes,<br />
They had not skill enough your worth to sing:<br />
For we, which now behold these present days,<br />
Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/107'>CVII.</a></p><p>
Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul<br />
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,<br />
Can yet the lease of my true love control, <br />
Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.<br />
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,<br />
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;<br />
Incertainties now crown themselves assured,<br />
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.<br />
Now with the drops of this most balmy time,<br />
My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,<br />
Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,<br />
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:<br />
And thou in this shalt find thy monument,<br />
When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/108'>CVIII.</a></p><p>
What's in the brain that ink may character<br />
Which hath not figured
to thee my true spirit?<br />
What's new to speak, what now to register,<br />
That may express my love, or thy dear merit?<br />
Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,<br />
I must each day say o'er the very same;<br />
Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine, <br />
Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.<br />
So that eternal love in love's fresh case,<br />
Weighs not the dust and injury of age,<br />
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,<br />
But makes antiquity for aye his page;<br />
Finding the first conceit of love there bred,<br />
Where time and outward form would show it dead.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/109'>CIX.</a></p><p>
O! never say that I was false of heart,<br />
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify,<br />
As easy might I from my self depart<br />
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:<br />
That is my home of love: if I have ranged,<br />
Like him that travels, I return again;<br />
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,<br />
So that myself bring water for my stain.<br />
Never believe though in my nature reigned,<br />
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,<br />
That it could so preposterously be stained, <br />
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;<br />
For nothing this wide universe I call,<br />
Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/110'>CX.</a></p><p>
Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,<br />
And made my self a motley to the view,<br />
Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,<br />
Made old offences of affections new;<br />
Most true it is, that I have looked on truth<br />
Askance and strangely; but, by all above,<br />
These blenches gave my heart another youth,<br />
And worse essays proved thee my best of love.<br />
Now all is done, have what shall have no end:<br />
Mine appetite I never more will grind<br />
On newer proof, to try an older friend,<br />
A god in love, to whom I am confined.<br />
Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,<br />
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/111'>CXI.</a></p><p>
O! for my sake do you with Fortune chide,<br />
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,<br />
That did not better for my life provide<br />
Than public means which public manners breeds.<br />
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,<br />
And almost thence my nature is subdued<br />
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:<br />
Pity me, then, and wish I were renewed;<br />
Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink<br />
Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;<br />
No bitterness that I will bitter think,<br />
Nor double penance, to correct correction.<br />
Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye,<br />
Even that your pity is enough to cure me.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/112'>CXII.</a></p><p>
Your love and pity doth the impression fill,<br />
Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow;<br />
For what care I who calls me well or ill, <br />
So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?<br />
You are my all-the-world, and I must strive<br />
To know my shames and praises from your tongue;<br />
None else to me, nor I to none alive,<br />
That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.<br />
In so profound abysm I throw all care<br />
Of others' voices, that my adder's sense<br />
To critic and to flatterer stopped are.<br />
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:<br />
You are so strongly in my purpose bred,<br />
That all the world besides methinks y'are dead.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/113'>CXIII.</a></p><p>
Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;<br />
And that which governs
me to go about<br />
Doth part his function and is partly blind,<br />
Seems seeing, but effectually is out;<br />
For it no form delivers to the heart<br />
Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch:<br />
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part, <br />
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch;<br />
For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,<br />
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,<br />
The mountain or the sea, the day or night,<br />
The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.<br />
Incapable of more, replete with you,<br />
My most true mind thus maketh mine eye untrue.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/114'>CXIV.</a></p><p>
Or whether doth my mind, being crowned with you,<br />
Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?<br />
Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,<br />
And that your love taught it this alchemy,<br />
To make of monsters and things indigest<br />
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,<br />
Creating every bad a perfect best,<br />
As fast as objects to his beams assemble?<br />
O! 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,<br />
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:<br />
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing, <br />
And to his palate doth prepare the cup:<br />
If it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin<br />
That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/115'>CXV.</a></p><p>
Those lines that I before have writ do lie,<br />
Even those that said I could not love you dearer:<br />
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why<br />
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.<br />
But reckoning Time, whose million'd accidents<br />
Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,<br />
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,<br />
Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;<br />
Alas! why, fearing of Time's tyranny,<br />
Might I not then say, 'Now I love you best,'<br />
When I was certain o'er incertainty,<br />
Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?<br />
Love is a babe, then might I not say so,<br />
To give full growth to that which still doth grow?<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/116'>CXVI.</a></p><p>
Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br />
Admit impediments. Love is not love<br />
Which alters when it alteration finds,<br />
Or bends with the remover to remove:<br />
O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,<br />
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;<br />
It is the star to every wandering bark,<br />
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.<br />
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br />
Within his bending sickle's compass come;<br />
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br />
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If this be error and upon me proved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I never writ, nor no man ever loved.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/117'>CXVII.</a></p><p>
Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all,<br />
Wherein I should your great deserts repay,<br />
Forgot upon your dearest love to call, <br />
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;<br />
That I have frequent been with unknown minds,<br />
And given to time your own dear-purchased right;<br />
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds<br />
Which should transport me farthest from your sight.<br />
Book both my wilfulness and errors down,<br />
And on just proof surmise accumulate;<br />
Bring me within the level of your frown,<br />
But shoot not at me in your wakened hate;<br />
Since my appeal says I did strive to prove<br />
The constancy and virtue of your love.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/118'>CXVIII.</a></p><p>
Like as, to make our appetites more keen,<br />
With eager compounds we our palate urge;<br />
As, to prevent our maladies unseen,<br />
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge;<br />
Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,<br />
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;<br />
And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness<br />
To be diseased, ere that there was true needing.<br />
Thus policy in love, to anticipate<br />
The ills that were not, grew to faults assured,<br />
And brought to medicine a healthful state<br />
Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured;<br />
But thence I learn and find the lesson true,<br />
Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/119'>CXIX.</a></p><p>
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,<br />
Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within,<br />
Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,<br />
Still losing when I saw myself to win!<br />
What wretched errors hath my heart committed,<br />
Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!<br />
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted,<br />
In the distraction of this madding fever!<br />
O benefit of ill! now I find true<br />
That better is by evil still made better;<br />
And ruined love, when it is built anew,<br />
Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.<br />
So I return rebuked to my content,<br />
And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/120'>CXX.</a></p><p>
That you were once unkind befriends me now,<br />
And for that sorrow, which I then did feel,<br />
Needs must I under my transgression bow,<br />
Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.<br />
For if you were by my unkindness shaken,<br />
As I by yours, you've passed a hell of time;<br />
And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken<br />
To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.<br />
O! that our night of woe might have remembered<br />
My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,<br />
And soon to you, as you to me, then tendered<br />
The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!<br />
But that your trespass now becomes a fee;<br />
Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/121'>CXXI.</a></p><p>
'Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,<br />
When not to be receives reproach of being;<br />
And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed<br />
Not by our feeling, but by others' seeing:<br />
For why should others' false adulterate eyes<br />
Give salutation to my sportive blood?<br />
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,<br />
Which in their wills count bad what I think good?<br />
No, I am that I am, and they that level<br />
At my abuses reckon up their own:<br />
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel;<br />
By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown;<br />
Unless this general evil they maintain,<br />
All men are bad and in their badness reign.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/122'>CXXII.</a></p><p>
Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain<br />
Full charactered with lasting memory,<br />
Which shall above that idle rank remain,<br />
Beyond all date, even to eternity:<br />
Or, at the least, so long as brain and heart<br />
Have faculty by nature to subsist;<br />
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part<br />
Of thee, thy record never can be missed.<br />
That poor retention could not so much hold,<br />
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;<br />
Therefore to give them from me was I bold,<br />
To trust those tables that receive thee more:<br />
To keep an adjunct to remember thee<br />
Were to import forgetfulness in me.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/123'>CXXIII.</a></p><p>
No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:<br />
Thy pyramids built up with newer might<br />
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;<br />
They are but dressings of a former sight.<br />
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire<br />
What thou dost foist upon us that is old;<br />
And rather make them born to our desire<br />
Than think that we before have heard them told.<br />
Thy registers and thee I both defy,<br />
Not wondering at the present nor the past,<br />
For thy records and what we see doth lie,<br />
Made more or less by thy continual haste.<br />
This I do vow and this shall ever be;<br />
I will be true despite thy scythe and thee.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/124'>CXXIV.</a></p><p>
If my dear love were but the child of state,<br />
It might for Fortune's bastard be unfathered,<br />
As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,<br />
Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.<br />
No, it was builded far from accident;<br />
It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls<br />
Under the blow of thralled discontent,<br />
Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls:<br />
It fears not policy, that heretic,<br />
Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,<br />
But all alone stands hugely politic, <br />
That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.<br />
To this I witness call the fools of time,<br />
Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/125'>CXXV.</a></p><p>
Were't aught to me I bore the canopy,<br />
With my extern the outward honouring,<br />
Or laid great bases for eternity,<br />
Which proves more short than waste or ruining?<br />
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour<br />
Lose all and more by paying too much rent<br />
For compound sweet, forgoing simple savour,<br />
Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?<br />
No; let me be obsequious in thy heart,<br />
And take thou my oblation, poor but free,<br />
Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,<br />
But mutual render, only me for thee.<br />
Hence, thou suborned informer! a true soul<br />
When most impeached stands least in thy control.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/126'>CXXVI.</a></p><p>
O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power<br />
Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle,
hour;<br />
Who hast by waning grown, and therein showest<br />
Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growest.<br />
If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,<br />
As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,<br />
She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill<br />
May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.<br />
Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!<br />
She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:<br />
Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,<br />
And her quietus is to render thee.<br />
(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)<br />
(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/127'>CXXVII.</a></p><p>
In the old age black was not counted fair,<br />
Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;<br />
But now is black beauty's successive heir,<br />
And beauty slandered with a bastard shame:<br />
For since each hand hath put on Nature's power, <br />
Fairing the foul with Art's false borrowed face,<br />
Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,<br />
But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.<br />
Therefore my mistress' eyes are raven black,<br />
Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem<br />
At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,<br />
Sland'ring creation with a false esteem:<br />
Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,<br />
That every tongue says beauty should look so.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/128'>CXXVIII.</a></p><p>
How oft when thou, my music, music play'st,<br />
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds<br />
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st<br />
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,<br />
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap,<br />
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,<br />
Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,<br />
At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!<br />
To be so tickled, they would change their state <br />
And situation with those dancing chips,<br />
O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,<br />
Making dead wood more bless'd than living lips.<br />
Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,<br />
Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/129'>CXXIX.</a></p><p>
The expense of spirit in a waste of shame<br />
Is lust in action: and till action, lust<br />
Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,<br />
Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;<br />
Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight;<br />
Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,<br />
Past reason hated, as a swallowed bait,<br />
On purpose laid to make the taker mad.<br />
Mad in pursuit and in possession so;<br />
Had, having, and in quest to have extreme;<br />
A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;<br />
Before, a joy proposed; behind a dream.<br />
All this the world well knows; yet none knows well<br />
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/130'>CXXX.</a></p><p>
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;<br />
Coral is far more red, than her lips red:<br />
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;<br />
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.<br />
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,<br />
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;<br />
And in some perfumes is there more delight<br />
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.<br />
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know<br />
That music hath a far more pleasing sound:<br />
I grant I never saw a goddess go, <br />
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:<br />
And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare,<br />
As any she belied with false compare.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/131'>CXXXI.</a></p><p>
Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art, <br />
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;<br />
For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart<br />
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.<br />
Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold,<br />
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;<br />
To say they err I dare not be so bold,<br />
Although I swear it to myself alone.<br />
And to be sure that is not false I swear,<br />
A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,<br />
One on another's neck, do witness bear<br />
Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.<br />
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,<br />
And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/132'>CXXXII.</a></p><p>
Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,<br />
Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,<br />
Have put on black and loving mourners be,<br />
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.<br />
And truly not the morning sun of heaven <br />
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,<br />
Nor that full star that ushers in the even,<br />
Doth half that glory to the sober west,<br />
As those two mourning eyes become thy face:<br />
O! let it then as well beseem thy heart<br />
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,<br />
And suit thy pity like in every part.<br />
Then will I swear beauty herself is black,<br />
And all they foul that thy complexion lack.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/133'>CXXXIII.</a></p><p>
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan<br />
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!<br />
Is't not enough to torture me alone,<br />
But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?<br />
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,<br />
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed:<br />
Of him, myself, and thee I am forsaken;<br />
A torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed.<br />
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward, <br />
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;<br />
Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;<br />
Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail:<br />
And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,<br />
Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/134'>CXXXIV.</a></p><p>
So now I have confessed that he is thine,<br />
And I my self am mortgaged to thy will,<br />
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine<br />
Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:<br />
But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,<br />
For thou art covetous, and he is kind;<br />
He learned but surety-like to write for me,<br />
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.<br />
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,<br />
Thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use,<br />
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;<br />
So him I lose through my unkind abuse.<br />
Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:<br />
He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/135'>CXXXV.</a></p><p>
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will,<br />
And Will to boot, and Will in over-plus;<br />
More than enough am I that vexed thee still,<br />
To thy sweet will making addition thus.<br />
Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,<br />
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?<br />
Shall will in others seem right gracious,<br />
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?<br />
The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,<br />
And in abundance addeth to his store;<br />
So thou, being rich in Will, add to thy Will<br />
One will of mine, to make thy large will more.<br />
Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;<br />
Think all but one, and me in that one Will.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/136'>CXXXVI.</a></p><p>
If thy soul check thee that I come so near, <br />
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will,<br />
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;<br />
Thus far for love, my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.<br />
Will, will fulfil the treasure of thy love,<br />
Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.<br />
In things of great receipt with ease we prove<br />
Among a number one is reckoned none:<br />
Then in the number let me pass untold,<br />
Though in thy store's account I one must be;<br />
For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold<br />
That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:<br />
Make but my name thy love, and love that still,<br />
And then thou lovest me for my name is 'Will.'<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/137'>CXXXVII.</a></p><p>
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,<br />
That they behold, and see not what they see?<br />
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,<br />
Yet what the best is take the worst to be.<br />
If eyes, corrupt by over-partial looks, <br />
Be anchored in the bay where all men ride,<br />
Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,<br />
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?<br />
Why should my heart think that a several plot,<br />
Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?<br />
Or mine eyes, seeing this, say this is not,<br />
To put fair truth upon so foul a face?<br />
In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,<br />
And to this false plague are they now transferred.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/138'>CXXXVIII.</a></p><p>
When my love swears that she is made of truth,<br />
I do believe her though I know she lies,<br />
That she might think me some untutored youth,<br />
Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.<br />
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,<br />
Although she knows my days are past the best,<br />
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:<br />
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:<br />
But wherefore says she not she is unjust? <br />
And wherefore say not I that I am old?<br />
O! love's best habit is in seeming trust,<br />
And age in love, loves not to have years told:<br />
Therefore I lie with her, and she with me,<br />
And in our faults by lies we flattered be.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/139'>CXXXIX.</a></p><p>
O! call not me to justify the wrong<br />
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;<br />
Wound me not with thine eye, but with thy tongue:<br />
Use power with power, and slay me not by art,<br />
Tell me thou lov'st elsewhere; but in my sight,<br />
Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:<br />
What need'st thou wound with cunning, when thy might<br />
Is more than my o'erpressed defence can bide?<br />
Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows<br />
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;<br />
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,<br />
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:<br />
Yet do not so; but since I am near slain, <br />
Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/140'>CXL.</a></p><p>
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press<br />
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;<br />
Lest sorrow lend me words, and words express<br />
The manner of my pity-wanting pain.<br />
If I might teach thee wit, better it were,<br />
Though not to love, yet, love to tell me so; <br />
As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,<br />
No news but health from their physicians know; <br />
For, if I should despair, I should grow mad,<br />
And in my madness might speak ill of thee;<br />
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,<br />
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.<br />
That I may not be so, nor thou belied,<br />
Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/141'>CXLI.</a></p><p>
In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes, <br />
For they in thee a thousand errors note;<br />
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,<br />
Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote.<br />
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted;<br />
Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,<br />
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited<br />
To any sensual feast with thee alone:<br />
But my five wits nor my five senses can<br />
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,<br />
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,<br />
Thy proud heart's slave and vassal wretch to be:<br />
Only my plague thus far I count my gain,<br />
That she that makes me sin awards me pain.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/142'>CXLII.</a></p><p>
Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,<br />
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:<br />
O! but with mine compare thou thine own state,<br />
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;<br />
Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine, <br />
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments<br />
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,<br />
Robbed others' beds' revenues of their rents.<br />
Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lov'st those<br />
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:<br />
Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,<br />
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.<br />
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,<br />
By self-example mayst thou be denied!<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/143'>CXLIII.</a></p><p>
Lo, as a careful housewife runs to catch<br />
One of her feathered creatures broke away,<br />
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift dispatch<br />
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay;<br />
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,<br />
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent<br />
To follow that which flies before her face,<br />
Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;<br />
So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee, <br />
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;<br />
But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,<br />
And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind;<br />
So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'<br />
If thou turn back and my loud crying still.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/144'>CXLIV.</a></p><p>
Two loves I have of comfort and despair,<br />
Which like two spirits do suggest me still:<br />
The better angel is a man right fair,<br />
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.<br />
To win me soon to hell, my female evil,<br />
Tempteth my better angel from my side,<br />
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,<br />
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.<br />
And whether that my angel be turned fiend,<br />
Suspect I may, yet not directly tell;<br />
But being both from me, both to each friend,<br />
I guess one angel in another's hell:<br />
Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt, <br />
Till my bad angel fire my good one out.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/145'>CXLV.</a></p><p>
Those lips that Love's own hand did make,<br />
Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate',<br />
To me that languished for her sake:<br />
But when she saw my woeful state,<br />
Straight in her heart did mercy come,<br />
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet<br />
Was used in giving gentle doom;<br />
And taught it thus anew to greet;<br />
'I hate' she altered with an end,<br />
That followed it as gentle day,<br />
Doth follow night, who like a fiend<br />
From heaven to hell is flown away.<br />
'I hate', from hate away she threw,<br />
And saved my life, saying 'not you'.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/146'>CXLVI.</a></p><p>
Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth, <br />
... ... ... these rebel powers that thee array<br />
Why dost thou pine
within and suffer dearth,<br />
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?<br />
Why so large cost, having so short a lease,<br />
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?<br />
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,<br />
Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?<br />
Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,<br />
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;<br />
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;<br />
Within be fed, without be rich no more:<br />
So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,<br />
And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/147'>CXLVII.</a></p><p>
My love is as a fever longing still,<br />
For that which longer nurseth the disease;<br />
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,<br />
The uncertain sickly appetite to please.<br />
My reason, the physician to my love, <br />
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,<br />
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve<br />
Desire is death, which physic did except.<br />
Past cure I am, now Reason is past care,<br />
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;<br />
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,<br />
At random from the truth vainly expressed;<br />
For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,<br />
Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/148'>CXLVIII.</a></p><p>
O me! what eyes hath Love put in my head,<br />
Which have no correspondence with true sight;<br />
Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,<br />
That censures falsely what they see aright?<br />
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,<br />
What means the world to say it is not so?<br />
If it be not, then love doth well denote<br />
Love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,<br />
How can it? O! how can Love's eye be true, <br />
That is so vexed with watching and with tears?<br />
No marvel then, though I mistake my view;<br />
The sun itself sees not, till heaven clears.<br />
O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,<br />
Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/149'>CXLIX.</a></p><p>
Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,<br />
When I against myself with thee partake?<br />
Do I not think on thee, when I forgot<br />
Am of my self, all tyrant, for thy sake?<br />
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend,<br />
On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon,<br />
Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend<br />
Revenge upon myself with present moan?<br />
What merit do I in my self respect,<br />
That is so proud thy service to despise,<br />
When all my best doth worship thy defect,<br />
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?<br />
But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind,<br />
Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/150'>CL.</a></p><p>
O! from what power hast thou this powerful might,<br />
With insufficiency my heart to sway?<br />
To make me give the lie to my true sight,<br />
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?<br />
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,<br />
That in the very refuse of thy deeds<br />
There is such strength and warrantise of skill,<br />
That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?<br />
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,<br />
The more I hear and see just cause of hate?<br />
O! though I love what others do abhor,<br />
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:<br />
If thy unworthiness raised love in me,<br />
More worthy I to be beloved of thee.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/151'>CLI.</a></p><p>
Love is too young to know what conscience is, <br />
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?<br />
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,<br />
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:<br />
For, thou betraying me, I do betray<br />
My nobler part to my gross body's treason;<br />
My soul doth tell my body that he may<br />
Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,<br />
But rising at thy name doth point out thee,<br />
As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,<br />
He is contented thy poor drudge to be,<br />
To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.<br />
No want of conscience hold it that I call<br />
Her love, for whose dear love I rise and fall.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/152'>CLII.</a></p><p>
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,<br />
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;<br />
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn,<br />
In vowing new hate after new love bearing:<br />
But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee, <br />
When I break twenty? I am perjured most;<br />
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,<br />
And all my honest faith in thee is lost:<br />
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,<br />
Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;<br />
And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,<br />
Or made them swear against the thing they see;<br />
For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured eye,<br />
To swear against the truth so foul a lie!<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/153'>CLIII.</a></p><p>
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:<br />
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,<br />
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep<br />
In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;<br />
Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,<br />
A dateless lively heat, still to endure,<br />
And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove<br />
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.<br />
But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired, <br />
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;<br />
I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,<br />
And thither hied, a sad distempered guest,<br />
But found no cure, the bath for my help lies<br />
Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.<br />
</p><p></p><p><a href='/sonnet/154'>CLIV.</a></p><p>
The little Love-god lying once asleep,<br />
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,<br />
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep<br />
Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand<br />
The fairest votary took up that fire<br />
Which many legions of true hearts had warmed;<br />
And so the General of hot desire<br />
Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarmed.<br />
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,<br />
Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,<br />
Growing a bath and healthful remedy,<br />
For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,<br />
Came there for cure and this by that I prove, <br />
Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.<br />
