VI just don't think playing three tron lands naturally, much less on turn 4, and then playing the new Eldrazi could ever be better than playing Karn or Wurmcoil in the same situation. If Eye or Temple get banned I think you play whichever doesn't get banned and then Heartless Summoning. You probably move back into a more midrange control strategy with that, maybe B/W or B/R.
p1
aVI like this analysis, but I wonder if more hybrid decks are possible without eye,  that have enough eldrazi for temple to be useful.  There are some pretty nice cards like displacer and tks that give good value without putting you all in on the eldrazi plan (like eye and mimic would).\u000a\u000aHeartless ramp won't be happy about losing eye but you will still be able to build it.  No clue I'd it will be good enough though. 
p2
aVWhy bother dropping a t3 blight herder when you can play karn?  \u000a    \u000aEdit: reality smasher* regardless, karn is still the best thing you can play off of a t3 tron
p3
aVNot to mention that it's not even going to be a t3 blight herder with friends in most circumstances. Natural Tron + Relic works, 2pc Tron + Map + Tormod's Crypt works at card disadvantage - none of these are impressive lines.
p4
aVOh man i actually meant reality smasher haha for some reason i always mix up the names of the two.
p5
aVReality Smasher smashes face (thanks to trample) and Blight Herder has a herd of Scions to shepherd. 
p6
aVExaclty this. I've played against tron eldrazi, and all of their threats feel massively less impactful than just getting a karn or a wurmcoil out there.
p7
aVI think Eldrazi players go to Legacy.
p8
aVThis is what I plan on. 
p9
aVTurning off the insane eldrazi mimic openers is one big strike against heartless summoning IMO. It also shuts off drowner of hope for those builds still running it. \u000a\u000aJust feels like there's too much splash damage that cuts the edge you'd get by powering out the drazi quickly.
p10
aVIf im going midrange and I need the ramp, I'm playing ancient stirrings, or I'm playing mind stone.
p11
aVThe heartless summoning decks are really more ramp/value decks than aggro.  Sure it would be nice to mimic ulamog, but that just feels a little win more. 
p12
aVAssuming [[Eye of Ugin]] gets banned, I think you main 4 [[Vesuva]] in its place
p13
aVA good idea but with only 4 copy targets in your deck you'd have to count on sometimes getting bake of your opponent. 
p14

p15
aVI think Thespian stage would work better. You can play it safely without having temple in your hand and just wait to use the copy feature, while having the choice to copy other lands in the meantime.
p16
aVI think the deck dies. Eldrazi is already fairly inconsistent (it regularly mulligans multiple times to find Eye or Temple) so reducing the number of that effect they get to play by half just makes the deck into a much slower Zoo deck, effectively.
p17
aVI enjoy seeing you squirm
p18
aVBecause losing twin hurt so much for you?
p19
aVThat's the implication, yeah.
p20
aVPrecisely! Others must suffer as i have.
p21
aVI think you'd stick with Heartless summoning and move up to playing things like Ulamog. I'm pretty sure the deck would look a lot like the current Heartless Eldrazi deck, but with the temples swapped out of course. 
p22
aVIf one is banned, the Heartless version with Wasteland Strangler is my first thought of where you'd go. Definitely not Tron lands, as the investment needed to get Tron on T3 ties up too much mana for you to bother with the Eldrazi. There are better payoffs.\u000a\u000aIf both are banned, the deck is dead. This is somewhat likely as Wizards have a tendency to overreact to lame duck formats (witness the massacre that hit Affinity in Standard; any two of Disciple, Ravager and Plating would have solved that deck, instead we had two of that trio PLUS the six artifact lands all taken out back and shot)
p23
aVAffinity was still the best deck after they banned it from what I've seen and heard
p24
aVIt was #1 after the first banning (Skullclamp).\u000a\u000aAfter the second it was completely dead.
p25
aVIt's better for them to overreact than underreact. If you ban what you think is the minimum and it turns out you're wrong, you look incompetent and players lose faith in your ability to manage the game. If you ban everything, so there is no chance of it surviving, you accomplish your goal without risk of having to come back in 4 months and ban something again
p26
aVThis kills the Eldrazi.
p27
aVthe deck will die I think if both are banned.  If eye is banned the deck might live on.
p28
aVBut be more fair,  like post-bans affinity.
p29
aVWhen Eldrazi does get banned, I'll be 99% sure WotC is going to hit temple. WotC will leave eye unbanned for tron players.
p30
aVWhy would you think that? It's the same crappy reasoning players had for wanting to ban Lilly rather than bloodbraid elf
p31
aVBanning Eye or Temple is irrelevant, the deck won't be destroying the meta anymore. Speculating on the potential effects of different bans on the deck when after the next ban and restricted update we will have a new set release which might impact Modern more than the last one and a couple of months in between.. Just so pointless.
p32
aVI'm confused by this post, you're not defending the power level of the Eldrazi deck, are you?\u000a\u000aI don't think any unbans or new cards will fix the oppressive Eldrazi decks 
p33
aVI believe he means it doesn't matter which one gets banned, but that it will make eldrazi bad until the point where it isn't toppling over the meta.
p34
aVHe isn't defending eldrazi. He's saying speculating on what will be good on April 11th is meaningless. If one of the two lands is banned, it doesn't change what (the post-ban) eldrazi deck will look like that much. There might also be unbannings and modern defining cards in innistrad, so who knows what will be playable
p35
aVEye of Ugin is definitely getting banned, maybe Reality Smasher as well. I think without the eye, I think the deck will run temple and then the urzatron lands, but will eventually drop down to at least tier 2.
p36
aVThey only need to ban Eldrazi Temple to bring the decks power level in line with the top end of the format. 
p37
aVThey only need to ban one of the lands imo. It would slow down the deck and make it inconsistent enough to not be the best deck.
p38
aVWhy would they get rid of eye over temple? If they hit eye then they are hurting tron too, and I don't think that's a deck that Is really in need of that right now, and hitting temple just takes care of the problem they are facing with Eldrazi decks
p39
aVTron really doesn't get hit that badly if they ban eye. Its inevitability drops a bit, but it would be trivial to adapt the deck.
p40
aVIts just what I think, but with Eye you can play Mimics for free on turn one, compared to temple that can only play one Mimic at a time. To me, I feel like that is a bigger problem.
p41
aV> Eye of Ugin is definitely getting banned, maybe Reality Smasher as well\u000a\u000aWhy would they ban Reality Smasher?\u000a
p42
aVI feel like Reality Smasher is a big part of the problem. The deck drops free mimics with Eye and then Smasher makes them big. Without Eye it slows the deck down, but Smasher can still drop relatively early, and a 5/5 trample haste with protection is still a problem for the meta. I think its a big enough issue that Wizards may deal with it.
p43
aVIt's hardly an issue when cast on turn 5.
p44
aVYeah, but with temple or urza lands it can come out turn 3.
p45
aVYes, with perfect draws, it can come out on turn three.  The mana is the issue not the 5/5.
p46
aVWhich is in no way more oppressive or scary than a t3 wurmcoil or karn. I get what you're saying but it's not that powerful. 
p47
aVNot by itself, but Mimic is still out there. And with Karn and Wurmcoil, you can kill it with a spell pretty easily. The whole discard thing, combined with haste trample, and coming out turn 3 feels powerful to me. 
p48
aVIt's powerful sure. But there are decks that can work around Smasher with cards like Loxodon Smiter and Obstinate Baloth. I would also personally claim that dealing with a karn is significantly harder that a smasher. And unless you're exiling it, killing wurmcoil can just create more problems. 
p49
aVIm not saying its more or less powerful Im saying it is powerful and an important part of the deck, and that Wizards might get rid of it as well.
p50
aVI was going to sign onto mobile just to downvote this, but it takes less effort to simply tell you that banning Reality Smasher would be absurd. 
p51
aVI'll just do it for you
p52
aVUpvote for good guy salt
p53
aVYou can just uncheck "Use subreddit style" or /r/modernmagic+null
p54
aV[[Worship]] is 4CMC, but totally worth it if you can survive long enough to play it.  Maybe add some Spirit Links to the main or side to survive longer.  You're a 4-5 turn aggro deck and they're a 3-4 turn aggro deck, so you'd better be ready to race!\u000a\u000aAnd of course, side in a couple [[Seal of Primordium]] if they're on a build with Chalice.

p56
aVThank you! I will try Worship and I think about adding 2 Spirit Links to the main.
p57
aVGhostly prison is much better than worship. Comes out sooner and is at the sweet spot in the bogles curve.  \u000a\u000aLifelink is key to the match so I'd definitely add some spirit links, and consider an unflinching courage.  \u000a\u000aOne thing that confuses me is I don't get why people don't use Qasali pridemage as ench/artifact removal -- it's a backup creature you can use in a pinch too. 
p58
aVSo you don't want to cast Daybreak Coronet on Turn 3? :o
p59
aVBogles will only hit their 4th land drop on turn 4 around half the time.
p60
aVI've always maindecked Qasali Pridemages in Bogles. Exalted is super relevant to our gameplan of aggressively beating down, and having flexible ench/artifact removal maindeck is super relevant in the metagame, since we can just lose outright to an unanswered spellskite or opposing Worship or Ensnaring Bridge. Having an extra creature to sac to Liliana is also huge and dodges another way we just get massively blown out.
p61
aVI actually think bogles is positioned well vs eldrazi. You just have to make sure you side in enough cards to save you from spellskite, chalice on 1 and ratchet bomb. Thankfully most versions do not run All is Dust as that would just wreck you. So get those Stony Silence's and Seal of Primordium's ready.
p62
aVI've really been liking spirit mantle, it allows your bogles to block really well until you can suit up a coronet and start beating down. It really helps.\u000a\u000aIf you're having issues with the colorless lists that play ratchet bomb/chalice/spellskite, then stony silence and seal of primordium will help you out. In the absence of those cards, I think the matchup is pretty favorable.
p63

p70
aVCards which utilize blue mana consistently push our vision for nwo complexity levels, because of this regretfully blue mana is banned.
p71
aVthis is uh... we're talking about modern here... Blue is already dead. In fact, basics are dead. If anything they need to print more powerful basics lands. I was looking the other day and apparently they used to print cards like Savannah and Badlands. I was thinking they could bring back that cycle but just make them basic as well.
p72
aVwell, i guess that does get around the RL
p73
aVyeah... a painlessly fetchable dual land that does not die to techedge nor ghostquarter :D definitely not OP :D 
p74
aVJust FYI, it does die to ghost quarter, it can kill basics. Not that it makes your point any less valid. 
p75
aVYeah right, but if you have "basics" like this it will be replaced with a same dual land which would not make any sense :)
p76
aVWell.... That's a duh on my part. Haha. 
p77
aV> this is uh... we're talking about modern here... Blue is already dead.\u000a\u000aNonsense.  Blue is exactly where green was back before M10: A support color.\u000a\u000aIt's quite telling to me that the only blue and black cards that see play are either a) printed before M10, b) widely considered design mistakes, or c) multicolored.
p78
aVAt least black's playables and mistakes aren't all banned like blue's are.
p79
aVDunno what you're smoking but black has gotten decent support with delve and kalitus.
p80
aVBlue got support with delve too, it just got taken away.
p81
aVKinda makes that a moot point doesn't it?\u000a\u000aIt's gotten jace, keranos, Sphinx Rev, and snaps but we're kinda digging here.
p82
aVthis isnt true for black. \u000a\u000akalitas, tasigur, murderous cut, lillana, thoughtseize, and plenty of other playables disagree with you
p83
aV>  tasigur, murderous cut\u000a\u000aDelve is widely considered a design mistake.  Cards like Gurmag Angler and Hooting Mandrils should not be Modern playable.  They're vanilla commons.  They only reason they're fine is because they're vanilla creatures.  Cards like Become Immense should also probably just not exist.  No comment on Treasure Cruise and Dig Through Time.\u000a\u000a> thoughtseize\u000a\u000aPrinted before M10.  Should have said IoK, but I've heard people say that's considered a design error, too, and should've been 2 or less..    It's not clear if they'll ever print a similar card.\u000a\u000a> lillana\u000a\u000aAlso largely considered a design mistake at 3 mana.  It's easily the second most powerful Planeswalker ever printed.\u000a\u000aKalitas is the only one I'd give you, but it remains to be seen just how good it is.  I've never seen it more than a 1-of.\u000a\u000aThe other one is phyrexian mana with Dismember and Gitaxian Probe.  I'm fairly certain both those cards have to be considered essentially design errors.  I bet they'd be {B/P}{B/P}{2} and {U/P}{1} if they were to be made again.  Mental Misstep was definitely a design error.\u000a\u000aThis is my point.  WotC has black and blue wedged into a super small design space.  They hate counterspells.  They hate discard.  They mostly hate bounce.  They hate graveyard manipulation.  They hate card draw.  They hate deck manipulation.  Only white gets mass removal.  Only white and green get non-creature removal, except for red's artifact removal.  Creature removal has been getting worse.  Green gets the best large creatures.  White and red get the best small creatures.  So... what the heck are black and blue supposed to do?\u000a
p84
aVNo offense, but *any* card seeing wide play in Modern is a design mistake, or close to one.\u000a\u000aIf blue and black are "just support colors," then what the heck are the  main colors?  I guess red can be considered one, since Burn is a thing.  White sure as hell isn't one.  Almost none of those great small creature that White gets see modern play, except in Death and Taxes/Hatebears (a perpetually Tier 2 deck).  I wouldn't exactly call Green a main color, either, except maybe Abzan Company/Chord decks.\u000a\u000aIn Modern, every color needs other colors to cover all the bases, unless your strategy is very linear (see Burn, Merfolk).  And even those decks often splash other colors in order to cover weaknesses.  \u000a\u000aAnd that's a good thing!  The color pie is supposed to create tension between mucking up your manabase and having access to different effects.  
p85
aVGreen is the main color in Modern, followed by Red.\u000a\u000aTron is Green.  The Red is pretty irrelevant and can easily be any other color.  Losing Ancient Stirrings and Sylvan Scrying would severely harm the deck, though.\u000a\u000aInfect is Green.  Needed for the pump spells and creatures.\u000a\u000aScapeshift is Green with mountains.  Need green for the ramp and scapeshift.\u000a\u000aBoggles is Green.  Needed for the pump spells and creatures.\u000a\u000aAffinity is Colorless.  It can be Red or Blue support, but often it's just colorless.  One wonders why they don't run more Green.\u000a\u000aChord/Company is Green.  Literally the foundation of the deck.\u000a\u000aZoo is Green.  Could be Naya or R/G, but it's always Green.\u000a\u000aLantern Control is usually Green/Black, although, like Affinity it's actually colorless.\u000a\u000aEven *Twin* was sometimes Green (TarmoTwin).\u000a\u000aSo, what else is there?\u000a\u000aRed Deck Wins, which is Red or R/b.  \u000aStorm is R/u.  \u000aMerfolk is Blue.  \u000a\u000aGreen is *by far* the most powerful color in Modern.\u000a
p86
aVPod was green, goyf is green, bbe was green.  Each considered mistakes. Infect as a mechanic is debatable as a mistake as well. Almost everything that's a staple in modern was either a mistake or an answer to a mistake (decay, also green). The "mistake" qualifier is useless for studying cards in modern both because it's not official (you're just writing everything in UB off as one) and because it's irrelevant. The cards are in modern and you're cherry picking. \u000a\u000aEvery single deck you named runs other colors/colorless and in many of them, green plays mostly a support role in the deck (tron is definitely a colorless based deck with green cantrips and tutors) or is a very limited splash (burn definitely a red deck, rug twin). \u000a\u000aGrixis isn't green. UR twin wasn't green. TC delver wasn't green and neither are the surviving UR/grixis delver archetypes. Affinity isn't green. UWR isn't green. Ad nauseam, merfolk, soul sisters, blue moon, 8 rack, BW tokens, skred, tezzeret, U tron, and mardu aren't green. I could go on into less popular decks but you get the point. \u000a\u000aBurn is very very red, scapeshift is very blue, lantern and tron are very colorless. Zoo, company, jund, boggles, and infect? Yep those are your real green decks. Those five. If you count green in burn/tron you have to count blue and black in things like scapeshift and jund or abzan company. \u000a\u000aIs green the best color? Maybe, maybe not. But it's not the core of most decks and it's definitely not in every deck. Look at legacy for an example of a format dominated by a color (and even there they have alternate decks).\u000a\u000aAlso white is definitely worse off than blue or black. Blue recently got two cards banned and Jace VP. Black recently got Tasigur/angler/cut and kalitas (who is the real deal in jund). Mistakes or no they were printed and some are still legal. Green got company/become immense (delve = mistake so doesnt count? Lol) recently and what else? Green cards like goyf, elves, nacatl, all the support cards like stirrings/scrying are old or mistakes.
p87
aVEven though you've clearly cherry-picked your list to make your argument look more compelling, overall you do make a decent point.  (Tron uses Green, but it's payoff spells are all colorless.  TarmoTwin was most definitely *not* a Green deck, usually splashing for a playset of a single card, plus sideboard options.) \u000a\u000aAt least right now, Green is very powerful.  I just don't see it as a problem, after such a long period of URx dominance (Twin, Grixis Control, Cruise Delver before that).  Colors rise and fall in prominence; the only constant is that White sucks.
p88
aVTrue, the worst opening in Magic is pretty much always going to be, "Plains. Go."\u000a
p89
aVJust to answer your question, Phyrexian mana in its entirety has been called a mistake. So if R&D could go back I think they would just not make GitProbe and Dismember at all.
p90
aVI think I've been convinced about black being shit  for mono color,  black multi colored is still amazing though,  and the color itself does great for splash utility
p91
aVYes, like blue it's a support color.
p92
aVThoughtseize was originally printed in Lorwyn in 2007.  
p93
aVsure, but it was also printed after m10, and that doesnt change the fact that black is one of the strongest colors prior to the eldrazi menace

aVEr them how do they make them? \u000a\u000aEdit: I am imagining a high tech card breeding machine,  after the first printing they keep some breeding stock so they don't have to print the cards again,  just allow them to breed naturally.

aVBasic duals... *shudder*
p99
aVAs nice as that sounds, 'basic duals' would almost assuredly destroy legacy. One of the key cards that keeps legacy's metagame stable is Wasteland. Take away the ability to stop people playing 4-5c decks and the format devolves into the "does he play blood moon?" gamble that modern is...
p100
aVBasic Duals would dodge Blood Moon and Back to Basics aswell.
p101
aVFair enough... PoP as well... \u000a\u000aHm, either way I think it would only be negative for the format, but that was incorrect of me to say.
p102
aVWhen your most popular blue deck is aggro you might be a modern player\u000a\u000aWhen a perfectly fine mainstay of your format gets banned "just because," you might be a modern player\u000a\u000aIf 95% of the cards in the best deck are standard playable and you're not playing in standard, you might be a modern player
p103
aVPretty sure that everyone should have expected this. Even at the worst of times with unprecedented metagames, there's never been an emergency banning, except for Jar. And Jar was stupid. Yes, Eldrazi is stupid too, but Jar was far stupider. It was a standard deck that could probably go toe to toe with today's vintage decks.\u000a\u000aIn case you need a snapshot of what Jar was capable of, take a look at the [Gauntlet of Greatness season 1 finals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2IZ5OOJx0M). Genuinely silly stuff.

aVFor all my frustration with modern, for the decks I've loved and lost, the decks I love now that don't stand a chance, I fully support waiting until April. I can survive a month or two without winning modern. If we expect this format to be treated as Eternal, we need to treat it as Eternal ourselves, and respect the *long* term situation.\u000a\u000aThe timing and process of ban issuance isn't the problem with modern. If we want this format to be here ten or twenty years later, then it's better to wait a month.
p111
aVI really don't get the reasoning of "not setting a bad precedent". I just don't understand why we have to wait.\u000a\u000aAre we really waiting for the meta to adjust? Is anyone out there thinking that it will regulate itself?\u000a\u000aThe only reason I can accept is that wizards is making more money. That's ok, we need them, so let them sell their packs with eldrazi. But I don't think we have to "secure moderns integrity" or shit like that.\u000a\u000aThis is a pure money decision. We don't need to defend it.
p112
aV> I really don't get the reasoning of "not setting a bad precedent". I just don't understand why we have to wait.\u000a\u000aBecause people are already gunshy about Modern because of all the bans.  If they start emergency banning, too, that will only increase uncertainty.

aVIf you really want to see what happens when a TCG starts dipping their toes into e-banning, go play yugioh.  
p114
aVThere is a modern grand prix in two weeks. You can't just ban cards out of the blue that close to an event, people need time to acquire new cards.

aV> not setting a bad precedent\u000a\u000aLet's say they set a precedent. Eldrazi is too powerful, let's emergency ban. Not only did they let the public dictate when an emergency ban happens, but they just unintentionally set a standard for when a modern deck gets an emergency ban.\u000a\u000aIf another deck gets a 40% win percentage at a Pro Tour, does it trigger an emergency ban? When does the emergency ban get triggered? When enough people complain? What happens when people who you don't agree with start complaining about another deck? Does an emergency ban happen?\u000a\u000aBasically, you have to realize that once you set a precedent, you set a standard. The standard currently being that "any deck that gets 40+% of the field in a Pro Tour has 2 weeks to reduce its numbers in the next SCG open (but before any GP) or else it gets an emergency ban".\u000a\u000aDoes that feel right to you, because that's what you're calling for? Alternatively, they can say in April that this is not what they want the format to be and update it at the next round of bannings to avoid setting a dumb precedent. 
p117
aVWell said
p118
aVJust ride it like Zendikar does: fight the eldrazi to the death even if there is no hope. 
p119
aVhey man im doing my part, bushwacker zoo. im like 2-0 vs eldrazi (one of which was like eldrazi light as he couldnt afford eye of ugin and the other was a great draw by me, and a triple mul by him). 
p120
aVI chose the route of the planeswalkers last zendikar set: "peace, bitches"
p121
aVMore of a smoldering crater than a footprint
p122
aVWell that's unacceptable.\u000a\u000aCycling lands aren't modern-legal.
p123
aVMan--before the set came out I was so sure of a blasted landscape reprint...
p124
aVx-post from r/MagicTCG:\u000a\u000aGood. There does need to be a ban, or multiple ones, to at least slow down Eldrazi decks for sure. That being said, the only reason to do an emergency ban is IF THE HEALTH OF THE GAME IS THREATENED. Given attendance numbers at SCG Louisville, and I'm guessing Wizards has internal numbers from Magic online, it appears people are not yet leaving Modern in droves, so taking care of this in the normal process is the right solution. April isn't that far away, guys.
p125
aVI don't mind waiting, I really don't.\u000a\u000aThe only reason I mind this particular time is because the only Modern GP within reasonable driving distance is coming up and the format is in shambles.\u000a\u000aIf this was off season with no big Modern events, I'd be a little more patient.
p126
aVIf people are going to leave in droves, which they will, why wait for them to leave before fixing the known problem?
p127
aVYou seem to exactly how other people will behave, care to let us all know when weed will be legal, or who the next president is?
p128
aVWhere I live, weed *is* legal.
p129
aVYeah, and grizzly Adams had a beard.
p130
aVGrizzly Adams DID have a beard haha!
p131
aVI eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast..
p132
aVYou eat shit for breakfast??
p133
aVBecause an emergency ban sets a dangerous precedent.  Letting Modern go until April is kind of shitty, but probably less shitty overall than making people fear that their $1000+ Modern deck could halve in value at any moment, rather than 4 specific days each year.
p134
aVBecause everyone knows the deck is getting a ban in April and they will all come back. 
p135
aVBecause you don't know that they will. You're just speculating. 
p136
aVEven if you operate under the assumption they won't leave wizards is still left staring at a format with nary an opinion to be found that deviates from "modern is awful right now but I expect a ban soon" or "I play this deck because it's so broken". Operating under the assumption that all of those people are bluffing and won't leave the new universal opinion of modern will be ammended to "modern is awful". The people harmed by such a ban are not deeply enfranchised players of the deck who have been on it for years and would feel cheated by the ban (not that that saved twin), it's people that looked at a new set and an old land, saw it was degenerate and jumped on board for some free tournament wins, or speccers who frankly aren't wizards target market. The cost of leaving it alone is the spiraling trust of players in wizards to handle the format competently, and many having long term plans of enjoying finally having a local GP to attend dashed as it gets swallowed because wizards doesn't want to appear flustered, or grinders giving these ones a miss. It's gotten so bad most people I talk to consider it rude to bring the deck to fnms, the only tangible gain from leaving it alone is saving face on wizards part, if it was an issue with standard I would fully understand, there are a lot of casual standard players who don't know the ins and outs of banning a and would feel cheated if their new cards were suddenly not allowed to be played, but it's modern, those who play modern know better. Not to mention the majority of players don't care about the newly printed cards they are calling for an eye ban, or eye and temple, but the mimic camp is small.
p137
aVControversial opinion incoming: Modern was already awful.\u000a\u000aWhat has Modern actually got going for it? It's cheap? No, it's absurdly expensive. It's diverse? Not really, strategically it's far from diverse. Lots of different decks that all do the same thing. You can do whatever you want and it's viable? Far from it, IMO Modern is the least brewable format. \u000a\u000ae.g. look at Vintage. Highest power level format. Yet still more brewable than Modern. Vintage isn't played quite enough that there are set decklists, so everyone essentially plays their own list but they all look the same to everyone else: either you play Shops or Dredge or Blue. But if you play blue, there are sooooo many different ways to go with it, and you can make up your own. Want to play mono-blue standstill in Vintage? Why the fuck not? Do it.
p138
aVVintage is not the best example of a healthy format imo.. Have you watched VSL? People often get locked out by turn 1, and it's sometimes rock paper scissors with matchups and starting hands.. Not always, but it feels bad when it happens..   \u000aModern might not be perfect, but it's still a vastly better format..
p139
aVThe VSL is not representative of Vintage at all. It's well known as an extremely warped metagame.\u000a\u000aAnd there's nothing unhealthy about what you describe. Those are parts of the format that people like an appreciate. Modern is actually very similarly swingy.
p140
aVModern is cheaper than legacy and less expensive than standard in the long run, accounting for decks rotating.\u000a\u000aModern was plenty diverse before the Eldrazi menace and the Twin banning. A little aggro heavy and control light, but nothing major.\u000a\u000aModern is a highly brewable format. In my experience, I've had more luck with brews in modern than in any other format I've played. The power level gap between tier one and three is tiny compared to other formats. Tier two / three decks show up in SCG or GP top 8s all the time. Compare to vintage, where every deck has to have all the same broken cards and very few strategies can actually compete.
p141
aVModern has one viable archetype: linear aggro. That's it. Vintage has  control, prison, combo, midrange, aggro, tempo, etc. It's varied and great. 
p142
aVThat's only true because of this eldrazi meta. Before eldrazi and before Twin was banned, the format was quite healthily diverse. There was tempo, combo, midrange, aggro, etc. etc..
p143
aVI think the appeal comes from the format essentially being "These are the cards we've printed since we got our proverbial shit together." It's the mending of formats. Unfortunately that means it's pretty low on things that are considered "unfun" for the opponent like land hate and playable counter magic and consistent combos. We are left with good old aggro.
p144
aV"This isn't working! Instead of the people leaving, they're staying in droves!"
p145
aVThey knew this was coming.\u000a\u000aThey knew when they cancelled the Modern PT what was coming.  They didn't want to deal with it then.\u000a\u000aNow, they're letting us live in this crappy world for a bit longer, as if to say, "Told you so."\u000a\u000aI kinda can't wait to see where all this goes.\u000a\u000aI love Modern.
p146
aVThe reason for cancelling the Modern Pro Tour was because we were switching Standard to two block sets and as such they wanted to showcase the different decks and 'formats.' (Granted this first set would have largely been abzan and rally everywhere)\u000a\u000aThe problem is that this change wasn't announced until a while after the cancellation. All we knew was that Wizards was cancelling Modern "because." Modern is the people's format, and as such, it felt like an attack on the format. They rallied in defense.\u000a\u000aIf they had announced the set change and *then* said Modern wouldn't be a Pro Tour format, I'm willing to be there would have been less outrage. There still would have been some, because the people want to watch and potentially play their favorite format at the highest level.
p147
aVthe thing is we asked for modern to have a PT. and wizards was like no pls. and we demanded it. so they said fuck you, no pod, no twin, have fun with eldrazi assholes! so now we have Zombie Modern, and wizards is like you like the modern PT HUH DONT YOU! IT PUTS THE TWIN IN THE BASKET OR IT GETS THE BAN HAMMER AGAIN!
p148
aVConfusing the twin/pod issue with the eldrazi one is not really helpful as they are both separate, with their timings being a coincidence.
p149
aVThey're different issues, but there is some crossover. The reasons they gave for banning Twin were thin at best. Pushing out other Ux strategies? Yeah because U is such a strong color in Modern. Meta share? That's the one that's hilarious. At it's height Twin only had 11% meta share. That's laughable when you look at Eldrazi now. \u000a
p150
aVYer appreciate there is a bit of cross over in that if twin was banned it might reduce the eldrazi metagame. But I disagree that Twin was only banned to cause a shake up. It won 50% of all modern PTs, and it won the last modern gp before the ban including 3 in the top 8. Finally if you look at modern gps in the last year all 10 of them have had twin in the top 8.
p151
aVThere were hints of other UR decks bubbling to the top immediately after the ban, though. RUG Delver, Blue Moon decks, Scapeshift, etc. Once the PT Eldrazi deck and its derivatives are gone, we might very well see the Twin ban be justified.\u000a\u000aI don't like that it was banned, no sir or ma'am. However, I trust enough in the justification to not call it "thin".
p152
aVBoth got banned right before the pt, which is because they want to "shake it up before the pt". And as for eldrazi i included it because it's another thing that has messed up the format since it has been given the pt again. 
p153
aVJust two things to add. Twin would have likely folded to Eldrazi pretty hard. Second, look at meta share. When you compare Twin and Eldrazi it isn't even close. That makes the Twin banning look even more unnecessary and that it was done to "shake things up for the sake of shaking things up". 
p154
aVI hate this false dichotomy that they keep toting. \u000a\u000aA modern pro tour doesn't necessitate shake-up bans. Wizards does that because they want to, not because they have to.\u000a\u000aThings like the twin banning isn't 'our fault' for wanting to watch our favorite format played by the world's best. It's their rigid vision for how pro tours will function. \u000a\u000aMismanagement of the format is not our fault. 
p155
aVYou know, there are quite a few people that don't see the twin ban as mismanagement or just a shake-up ban. I definitely think all of this "timing" stuff is bullshit though. IMO they should have banned twin a long time ago. Banning to shake up the format is super counter-intuitive to the plan of having realistic competitions. One in which skill is a big determining factor. Banning to shake up the format to get people interested is fucked up.
p156
aVYou think they should have banned Twin long ago because you're salty about losing to it. Twin has never been too dominant in Modern. Twin should not have been banned. It simply does not meet any criteria.\u000a\u000aTwin has long been used as an example of the sort of card that will always be legal in Modern. People ask 'what are the criteria for banning' and the answer is pretty much 'turn 4 rule, too dominant. Twin is a good example of a deck that is strong but not dominant and doesn't break the turn 4 rule because it never wins before turn 4.'
p157
aVI just want to be able to play cool decks without feeling bad about new bans all the time. I didn't even play twin, but I feel really bad for those folks. And now people are saying Affinity needs a ban because it's the only untouched pillar of the format basically. Maybe Wizards really needs to get their shit together and actually test for Modern, maybe something else, but either way some part of their decision making process over there needs to change. 
p158
aVThis is the worst part. I was a twin player, and I don't feel like it should have been banned, but now people are calling for something from Affinity to be banned. Affinity isn't an unhealthy deck. Sure, it's linear and fast, but it's also very disruptable. You don't ban a deck because it's good. Being good isn't unhealthy. If every good card gets banned then we're left with a bunch of shitty cards to play in shitty decks. \u000a\u000aTake things off the ban list. Introduce new, powerful answer cards into the format. If not through standard, then through a separate supplemental set.\u000a\u000aModern's meta was absolutely amazing three months ago. You never knew what tier 2 deck could show up in the top eight of a major. Yeah, there were format staples, but so fucking what? Nothing was unbeatable. If Wizards doesn't quickly change the way they're handling the format, I'm never going to enjoy it again. There will be no point in playing. 
p159
aV> This is the worst part. I was a twin player, and I don't feel like it should have been banned, but now people are calling for something from Affinity to be banned.

If every good card gets banned then we're left with a bunch of shitty cards to play in shitty decks.\u000a\u000aI don't play Affinity, but I am very much against them hitting Affinity in the next B&R update. Affinity is only putting up the numbers it is because it's the only deck that stands a decent chance against Eldrazi. If they reign in Eldrazi, I think we'll see a swing back towards midrange. Affinity is a deck that is very easily hated out. Once the meta balances out, I don't think Affinity will be putting up the same numbers. 
p160
aVThis.  Every time Wizards says that bans are necessary for a PT format, it means they have no idea what they're talking about.
p161
aVPlease, tell us more from your extensive experience managing the biggest TCG in the world.
p162
aVYeah because WotC clearly are doing it all right! That's why everyone constantly complains about all the various ways in which they fuck things up.\u000a\u000aEMA has no dual lands. They constantly fuck up Modern. They banned people for no reason for their own leaky mistakes. etc. etc. etc. MTGO is still shit. etc. etc. etc.
p163
aVPeople complain about fucking everything, because everyone thinks they're entitled to get things exactly how they want them. That's not how the real world works.
p164
aVNo, people do not complain about everything. Nobody would be complaining about Eternal Masters if it had reserved list cards in it. Nobody would be complaining about Modern if they had any sane idea how to manage the banlist.\u000a\u000aPeople complain about things they fuck up. You can't just respond to all the complaints with 'you guys just complain about everything'. No, WotC fucks up everything.
p165
aV> No, people do not complain about everything. Nobody would be complaining about Eternal Masters if it had reserved list cards in it. Nobody would be complaining about Modern if they had any sane idea how to manage the banlist.\u000a\u000aPeople have *lots* of other complaints about Modern, and I'm sure there would be at least a *little* controversy if they were including RL cards.\u000a\u000aI think people *do* complain about everything, but not *everyone* complains about *each* thing; just like anywhere else online, when people say "I can't win; first I did this and you people didn't like it, but then I switched and you didn't like that either" -- they're probably just talking to multiple people who have different opinions, and you can't please them all. Addressing one person's complaints just creates new ones for others. At some point WotC has to set aside the peanut gallery and think for themselves to decide the direction they want to take the game, and when they do so, their motivations, no matter how pure, will never be 100% aligned with those of any given player.
p166
aV>People have lots of other complaints about Modern, and I'm sure there would be at least a little controversy if they were including RL cards.\u000a\u000aAnd all of them are as a result of their terrible handling of the banlist. Too linear? Banlist issue. Eldrazi? Banlist issue. etc.\u000a\u000a
p167
aVDude, people complained about Expediations!  Even if you hate them (as I do, no interest in owning them whatsoever), how is it bad that you may get a $100+ card in any given pack you open?\u000a\u000aAnd now they print Eternal Masters, with Legacy staples in it.  Staples that many thought they'd never reprint, even though they're on the Reserve List.  And all people like you can do is complain that there are no Reserve List cards on it.  \u000a\u000aSome people really do complain about everything.
p168
aV>Dude, people complained about Expediations! Even if you hate them (as I do, no interest in owning them whatsoever), how is it bad that you may get a $100+ card in any given pack you open?\u000a\u000aBecause they need to reprint all those cards en masse properly, and printing them in a way that doesn't make the formats that depend on them more accessible is a giant 'fuck you'.\u000a\u000a>And now they print Eternal Masters, with Legacy staples in it. Staples that many thought they'd never reprint, even though they're on the Reserve List. And all people like you can do is complain that there are no Reserve List cards on it.\u000a\u000a**AND DOING SO, AS I'VE EXPLAINED, HAS MADE LEGACY MUCH MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO PLAY.**\u000a\u000a
p169
aVNo one should be complaining about Eternal Masters in the first place. You're only complaint is that it doesn't have cards from the reserved list. If you expected cards from the reserved list to be printed then you're crazy.
p170
aVYeah, no you're correct.\u000a\u000aThe fact is though, they couldn't just come out and say something like:\u000a\u000aHey players, you're going to absolutely hate the format and call us a bunch of idiots when we print a deck that is as consistent and aggressive as affinity, but more resilient.  So, we're cancelling the pro-tour for modern.
p171
aVSo we know that a ban is coming. Are they willing to let modern Eldrazi keep a sol land? I could make an argument for either one or both.\u000a\u000aTake out both and pretty much kills this version of the deck. This is fitting with Wizards past actions by killing the key pieces. Maybe Tron will start packing some Eldrazi to fill the blind spot from the eye ban.\u000a\u000aTake out Eye of Ugin and leave temple in and the deck gets slowed down a bit, but with Vesuva and land fetches it could still be a problem down the line.\u000a\u000aLeave Eye and take out temple, and there's no collateral damage to Tron. Maybe the deck still survives with the discount from eye and some smaller creatures.\u000a\u000aOverall, we know something is going, it just depends how hard Wizards wants to hit this deck.
p172
aVMaybe take our Mimics ? It's the card which allows for the most explosive starts (and potential T2/3 kills). The deck would still exist and be strong, people would not need to sell everything at discounted prices but it would most certainly be less of a Tiers 0 deck, I think (though this would need some testing).
p173
aVIf you consider it as to what feels bad when playing (a criteria they don't outright use but may affect their decisions), "turn 2 4/4 4-drop that makes my hand a mulligan" is not too far below "dropping 3 free 2/1s and 2/2s on turn 1".\u000a\u000aI would be willing to bet a large amount of people would be unsatisfied if that former play was left in the format, though I don't know if that should add weight to the ban discussion at large.
p174
aVEye allows all of the most degenerate plays the deck has to offer. Temple can SoL 1 thing, and you're powering out a cardpool that's restricted to 3 sets. Eye frequently represents more than 2 mana a turn AND tutors.\u000a\u000aWith just Eldrazi Temple, the deck probably remains a deck. But only double temple hands are as crazy as "the nuts" in any other aggro deck.
p175
aVBut banning eye hits tron hard as well.. there is no real right answer to this in my eyes, and I am about finished putting together a eldrazi list as well because I already had temples and eyes before the spike, however the deck is likely to powerful in its current state, and I would like a banning I think temple is more likely than eye because leaving eye doesn't hurt tron and it lets eldrazi stay a fairly strong deck and the legend rule punishes the double eye hands where double temple makes you a happy man
p176
aVEye is not a critical piece of tron, it's also the far more busted of the two fast mana lands. Eye produces more than 2 mana a turn for Eldrazi and needs to be removed to balance the deck.\u000a\u000aProtecting Tron is not critical for the health of the format. The question really is between banning Eye or banning Eye and Temple.
p177
aVI don't feel that way at all, tron relies heavily on eye to keep threats flowing, also while eye can provide 4+ mana per turn that is also assuming you have all 3 drop eldrazi or it is exceedingly late and you still have a large hand for some reason and you haven't bricked and drew another eye to disrupt the mana you have down.
p178
aVI know you're worried about your tron deck but you need to be realistic about this. Cards that dominate the pro tour and subsequent events don't tank in price without a reason.
p179
aVI am aware of this however, I do not play tron, look at my flair, my point is that yes there is a ban income that much is obvious to everyone, but I am arguing that eye is not the biggest offender, temple is honestly more powerful overall, eye is flashier with the t1 4 mimic into t2 vile aggregate kills but temple is more versatile, non legendary and banning it only hurts eldrazi. also the deck doesn't need to be killed, only weakened, having four eye is much less powerful overall than having the four temples you can play willie nilly and make TKS and Reality smasher easy as all hell to get the colorless to cast them, eye doesn't reduce the (c) costs only the generic mana, overall it seems more dangerous but is much less  overall strong.
p180
aVYou are wrong.
p181
aVOkay, convincing argument, you win. your logic far outstrips my own and I concede to your wisdom. 
p182
aVArgument has already been presented. If you think eye isn't problematic, go ahead and spec on them before April rolls around.
p183
aVThat's okay with me,\u000a\u000aI'm just gonna play Legacy or some other game in the meantime (maybe Standard a bit, because MOCS would be useful to do)\u000a\u000aYes I'm MTGO only.  and modern doesn't look very useful to play if I can't play affinity nor eldrazi atm on there...\u000a\u000aSo sure.\u000aI'll just be playing another format or game.
p184
aVThis showcases an issue Modern faces. Standard and Limited drive the most sales and therefore all playtesting is done with only those formats in mind. Modern is never playtested before the set is released and now the worst case scenario happens as a result: the format becomes all but unplayable for two or three months.
p185
aVYeah... I probably won't be flying interstate for gp Melbourne then. That's a lot of money to be bored losing to eldrazi. Shame, this is the first Australian modern gp in years too.
p186
aVThis is not a footprint.  We're already talking about the state of Modern with respect to the Eldrazi in terms of Combo Winter, Caw Blade, and Affinity Standard.  
p187
aVYes, because everyone on reddit loves to blow things out of proportion. This is nowhere near as bad as any of those things. 
p188
aVThis is a million times worse than Cawblade.
p189
aVI'm going to assume by Cawblade you mean 'Standard while JTMS was legal'. There were 32 copies of JTMS in the top 8 of GP Dallas in 2011, and 26 copies at GP Singapore right before it got banned. \u000a\u000aSo no, it's not "a million times worse than Cawblade". 
p190
aVThis is far worse than Cawblade Standard. The number of copies in the top 8 is not the sole factor used to determine if a deck is broken.\u000a\u000aCaw-Blade Standard was an excellent format. It was full of interesting, even, skill-testing matchups. Cawblade was prevalent, but it was also a really, really great mirror to play. The format was a LOT of fun, Jace was a fun card to play with, Stoneforge Mystic was great, the other decks in the format were great.\u000a\u000aModern at the moment is absolute cancer. If you're not playing Eldrazi you're playing some other awful linear aggro deck. 
p191
aVIf it is worth anything to you. Lsv said last night that the eldrazi was not that strongest deck he had ever played. He said caw blade was. And a toss up between  eldrazi and his pt winning elf deck
p192
aVRe-read my post. I said nothing about the comparative diversity of the format, nor the power.
p193
aVHave you seen the art?  Eldrazi have big feet
p194
aVIt's not nearly that bad. Exaggerating like this doesn't help either side. 
p195
aVIt's not as bad as combo winter. But it is absolutely comparable.
p196
aVWhat's the use of that comparison if not as a comparison of degrees of brokenness? Everyone agrees that those formats and this format are broken. \u000a\u000aThis format is substantially less broken than those formats though. \u000a\u000a
p197
aVThe point I was making was that while for example Abzan midrange might have been 25%+ of the Standard meta in THS-KTK Standard, it was still a reasonably healthy metagame. It wasn't really comparable to any of the historically unhealthy metagames. It wasn't anything even close to combo winter or affinity standard or caw blade standard. \u000a\u000aIn comparison, this Modern environment is so unhealthy that it can be meaningfully compared to those. You can have a reasonable debate on whether this is more or less healthy than CawBlade. You can reasonably justify either of those points of view, I think. I personally think this is worse, and I think I can justify that belief, but I also can understand why others think Cawblade was worse. \u000a\u000aTL;DR: this format is quite reasonably comparable in brokenness to those formats. It's at the same order of magnitude of brokenness.\u000a\u000aAnd personally? I'd much rather play in Caw-blade Standard than this current Modern environment. 
p198
aVAt least Caw Blade has an interesting mirror.
p199
aVIt's not Combo Winter bad, no.  The reason we're talking about it in the same terms is because it's rare that the metagame is so unhealthy that we just don't want to engage it.  The most prominent examples of such times are the ones I listed above.\u000a\u000aThe worst part of the current situation, though, is that Combo Winter had a hoser deck: 400 Islands.  Caw Blade had a hoser deck.  Affinity Standard had a hoser deck.  Eldrazi does not have such a deck.  There are serious questions as to whether such a deck can exist, given that the engine of brokenness is a pair of lands that allow you to cheat extensively on mana before meaningful land destruction can come down.\u000a
p200
aVCombo Winter is an exaggeration.\u000a\u000aThat said, the Pro Tour and SCG Open results made me cancel my plans to go to GP Detroit.  I hope that more people do that and Wizards takes notice.
p201
aVDetroit local here. Preparing for endless Eldrazi and Lantern Control rounds. 
p202
aVIt's not even close to combo winter
p203
aVYou're right. Combo winter had multiple viable decks. Modern doesn't. Modern is a faster format than that Standard environment, though. Every single viable deck in Modern is capable of winning on turn 3, just like in combo winter.
p204
aVI'd like to see a game where Jund or Tron wins on turn three, or heck... Even the UW control deck that went pretty high on the PT. :)
p205
aVJund isn't viable in Modern at the moment, and even before Eldrazi it was the only fair deck in the format.\u000a\u000aTron regularly wins on turn 3. The game just isn't over on turn 3. It still wins on turn 3, just like Amulet's turn 3 win rate looked lower than it really was, because it regularly won the game on turn 3 but didn't always actually finish the game on that turn.\u000a\u000aThe game can be over without being over. Turn 3 Karn is a win 95% of the time.
p206
aVTwin was also fair, but I understand your point.
p207
aVMarginally.
p208
aVI'll agree with that.
p209
aVi mean it did a whole lot of fair things to set up an easily disrupted unfair thing. 
p210
aVVery easily disrupted. Why were people so mad about having to run instant speed removal? It's CONSTRUCTED MAGIC, all constructed magic formats require you to have instant-speed removal.
p211
aVI think they shouldve banned Exarch. Allow the combo to still exist but make it weaker and more susceptible to removal. 
p212
aV> Turn 3 Karn is a win 95% of the time.\u000a\u000aYeah...not always. 95% is a little ambitious. 75% maybe...
p213
aVEntirely true. The funniest thing about this is people that are saying "It's not as bad as XYZ." Like memory jar is the go-to "it's not as bad as..." Well...It kind of is...\u000a\u000aYou know what cards are trash tier right now? Snapcaster, bolt, tarmogoyf, abrupt decay. Bloodbraid would likely be bad right now as well. 
p214
aVI was just thinking about this. BBE is a strictly worse version of thought not seer. Best case BBE hits a thought seize but it still has a body that is considerably smaller. Although BBE can out right win games if your lucky enough to hit a timely bolt with it. 
p215
aVI think the problem with BBE will always be its ability to hit Lili (Kommand is probably up there); hitting thoughtsieze off BBE is more like worst case than best.
p216
aVjund is bad. A fucking basically legacy deck is bad. A good stuff deck is bad. Like what the fuck. 
p217
aVNow it's just Jund Badstuff
p218
aVNah, the stuff is still good, but it's just not good enough anymore.
p219
aVSo, does this mean we'll get 1 month more of Eldrazi dominance or 1 year?
p220
aVI'd assume normal time line means SOI, because there's the possibility of a BR update with every set release
p221
aV50% Eldrazi through the rest of the year will legitimately kill Modern. People will grudgingly wait until the April B&R update, but if nothing changes they will start to sell out.
p222
aVHell, I'm considering even now trying to trade my modern collection into a miracles deck.
p223
aVIf you are really considering doing this, now is the time. Legacy staples are about to skyrocket because of EMA.
p224
aVYep. I just need to find a volc and two tundras, the rest of the stuff I need I don't think is on the reserve list so I'll probably just wait and see if it's in EMA.\u000a\u000aI'm considering using topdeck.ru to buy the duals for a fairly cheap price, is that something you have any experience with?
p225
aVI would advise moving on those sooner than later, with a lot of Legacy staples becoming more available, I can see people joining the format and duals getting more expensive as a result.
p226
aVI've only used pucatrade as far as sites like that go, but had zero issues with that. I'm sure its the same thing. I always recommend filming yourself opening the envelope on your phone and checking to see if its real so you can prove you got sent a fake. I got sent a fake wasteland from ebay one time and had no way to prove it.
p227
aVThis is a good thing.\u000a\u000aDespite how terrible this Eldrazi thing is, despite how obvious it is that something needs to be banned, despite how obvious it is that something will be banned - it is important that we have some protection against ourselves and our overreactions.\u000a\u000aIf only Wizards would communicate a little sooner.\u000a\u000aI am sad that we will lose 3 GP's to this problem though :(
p228
aVOnce the plunge in event attendance becomes a clear trend, Wizards will have to do something.
p229
aVHow many big Modern events are there between now and April 8?  
p230
aVNot sure. But I think the impact may be felt more at lower levels of play. If stores with weekly Modern events see a huge reduction in attendance, they're gonna be pretty pissed at Wizards
p231
aVThis is not surprising at all, emergency banning Eldrazi sets a bad precedent. If they ban now we're going to have people crying for a ban every time a new deck breaks out at a tournament. It's essentially a forgone conclusion at this point that this archetype will be gone with the next B&R update, we just need to wait out the storm.
p232
aV>This is not surprising at all, emergency banning Eldrazi sets a bad precedent.\u000a\u000aThat when the format is broken, they'll ban something from the broken deck? That's a good precedent.\u000a\u000a>If they ban now we're going to have people crying for a ban every time a new deck breaks out at a tournament.\u000a\u000aLol, as if we didn't already have this. Look, Eldrazi isn't just some flash in the pan. It's not just some breakout deck. This is not even slightly comparable to when Lantern Control or Amulet Bloom broke out and won a single tournament then fell back into being fairly obscure.
p233
aVAmulet Bloom still ate a ban... that aside, the precedent it sets is that if the Pros can come up with a list and spike a tournament (ala extended Elves), that is fine. If the deck then proves to be too powerful and can't be stopped (what is going on now), they will ban it at the next possible juncture. This gives them time to look at statistics and make the correct decision as to if/what they should ban.
p234
aVFrom what Tom LaPille was saying in his interview on Modern, I think you're significantly overestimating how much thought goes into what is banned. What he said indicated that generally some designated person (he mentioned Aaron Forscythe, but of course Tom LaPille himself was in this role at one point, see the Mystical Tutor debacle for more on why he no longer is) basically goes off, thinks about what to ban, and they ban that card or those cards.\u000a\u000aFrankly, everyone knows that Eye of Ugin will be banned in April. Everyone knows it. Now there are plenty of Tron players saying 'ban Temple instead!!!' but everyone that isn't emotionally and financially invested in Eye of Ugin remaining unbanned (i.e. everyone that isn't playing RG Tron or Eldrazi) knows that it should be banned, I think.\u000a\u000aSo why not just ban it now? Nobody is going to come up with a way to deal with Eldrazi before April. 
p235
aVYou don't ban it now because that sets a bad precedent. You ban at the normal cycle which isn't that far away. I used to play Eldrazi but just sold out of it because I agree, Eye is going to get the ax (even though I played the fair BW variant that was midrangy and grindy). Just let it run it's course and after the issue is resolved, we will see where Modern is at.
p236
aVDid you read /u/LinkMaster111's point at all? Banning it now sets a bad precedent. Think of it like a court case. Everyone knows that this person committed a murder - he was caught in the process, it was shown on national TV, etc. But still, we can't say 'put him in jail for life immediately' - he still needs to have a fair trial and receive due process. The rules are there for a reason.
p237
aVSo the "killer" should remain at large for 2 months? I guess your LGS doesn't run modern events because these things have actual implications for shop owners. My LGS started running FNM drafts because modern attendance is gone.
p238
aVYou missed their analogy completely.
p239
aVExactly.
p240
aV>  If they ban now we're going to have people crying for a ban every time a new deck breaks out at a tournament.\u000a\u000aThis already happens, Bloom ate a ban thanks to community overreactions. Modern shouldn't remain a garbage format until April. People would like to see a post-twin meta with decks other than Eldrazi and linear aggro. If it's a forgone conclusion, then let's just speed up the process.\u000a\u000aThere's a difference between format-warping and clearly broken. Eldrazi break the cardinal rule of magic (fast mana) and there's no reasonable workaround. I played during original Mirrodin and this is far, far worse than affinity ever was.
p241
aVEchoing Eternities 1C Instant Exile target colorless creature and all creatures with the same name as that one. 
p242
aVThank god. Maybe now people will stop comparing the deck to Memory Jar.
p243
aVSo, I'm going to have to ask if you played during combo winter? If you did, you'd know that it pretty much is as bad as that, to be completely honest. \u000a\u000aThe exodus of people losing interest in modern is great but the player base is hundreds of times larger now so it isn't felt as much. It's honestly a tad upsetting to watch the attendance at my weekly drop because 2-3 Dr. Moneybags who didn't care about losing hundreds of dollars when it gets banned can play it. \u000a\u000aIt's a deck that has no natural predators, has more inevitability than the field, relies on a completely broken set of cards, relies on fast mana... stop me when this starts sounding eerily similar to something you referenced.
p244
aV2-3 Dr. Moneybags... Lol\u000a\u000aMaybe they actually enjoy playing the deck? People like shops decks and mid-range non green decks as mind-blowing as that is.  For everyone 2-3 people that lose interest 2-3 gained\u000a\u000aIn no way am I saying eldrazi shouldn't be banned rho, but your post is really whiney about players playing what they want to plau
p245
aVTranslation: "We love money, so until Shadows is out, deal with it." 
p246
aVThis just in!  Corporation wants to make money!  In other news, sky still blue, war between dogs and cats continues.  Back to you, Jim.
p247
aVITT: people who for some unfathomable reason cannot find something else to occupy their time for the 30 ish days until the B&R announcement.
p248
aVThis is a hilarious endorsement for waiting until April. \u000a\u000a'Gosh, all these people correctly identify that the format is fucked until something happens, what a bunch of idiots. They should just be abandoning the format entirely'
p249
aVmore like "Gosh, these people correctly identify that Wizards is going to be banning something in a month, they should take a quick break from Modern until that happens if they're so upset about it."\u000a\u000athe sky is always falling somewhere in the Magic-verse, and if it's not fixed *oh my god right now RIGHT NOW wizards what are you even DOING*, everything is awful FOREVER, IMMEDIATELY.\u000a\u000apeople could use a healthy dose of patience and perspective.
p250
aVMy biggest complaint is that I had a local scg event ruined (Louisville), and three of the limited amount of Modern GPs are going to be completely fucked because of it. Events that should have been highlights of the year for me are instead going to be a fuck fest. 
p251
aVI think you mean GPs but yes I agree.
p252
aVI did, thank you. 
p253
aVThat's fair.
p254
aVwhy don't we as a community just start our own format of pre BFZ modern.  I would play that and ignore everything that hasbro does from this point on and be very happy with it.
p255
aVyou could also play legacy
p256
aVSure. Ill just dig up 2k from my back pocket
p257
aVAfter this past weekend, I just don't get how some people are still saying the deck is fine or that the meta will adjust. Thankfully a vast majority have come to the conclusion that the deck is absolutely broken and that the format is warped to the point where a ban is necessary. The people that are still saying the deck is fine or the meta will adjust, I have to think those people are either on Eldrazi or they're just trolling. 
p258
aVI will say this: I think the Eldrazi deck has been blown way out of proportion. This deck has some serious problems and has definite answers. So have faith that the community can find answers to this deck or series of decks, because there are three other top tier Eldrazi decks.\u000aI would say that we are not acting very mature here. I can confess that I was very negative towards he eldrazi decks, but now that I had time to settle down. It isn't that big of a deal. It is similar to all other aggro decks that play big things quickly.
p259
aVWhat "other aggro decks that play big things quickly" are there? Just curious
p260
aVMerfolk, Knights, and some Zoo. While they do use lords, but the creatures can and often are bigger.
p261
aVNo disrespect or anything but i find those comparisons impossible to make. Comparing eldrazi aggro to any other creature-deck in modern is just ridiculous.
p262
aVPossibly true. The problem with the Eldrazi deck is the ability to tap lands for more mana then one. However, I do not think of the deck any more then an aggressive aggro deck that could kill you faster then you can react. Something like infect could kill faster, or something like burn can be more consistent. Aside from the land mana problem, I do not think there are any other legitimate accusations that can be made.
p263
aVoh boy...\u000a
p264
aVI find that Echoing Truth and Stubborn Denial are both good against any hate card. Stubborn Denial is great against any sort of combo and is very versatile, so I'd bring that in for sure. 
p265
aVYes. Zoo has pretty good game against all the non-eldrazi decks in the format, it just doesn't even come close to beating eldrazi. Cards like Wild Nacatl and Tarmogoyf don't line up too well against 4/4s on turn 2 and 5/5s on turn 3
p266
aVIt was lookin' good for ol' Zoo when Twin got banned... And then Eldrazi happened :(
p267
aV...until the the Eldrazi nation attacked
p268
aVevery deck in the format gets better if eldrazi gets the banhammer. That's why it needs the banhammer :)
p269
aVI have had a lot of success moving towards wilt leaf liege in my Naya zoo deck, Elspeth, knight errant also does a lot of work. 
p270
aVHave a list? I love wilt-leaf actually!
p271
aVI am not playing goyf due to budgetary concerns but this is my current list:\u000a4 Noble Hierarch\u000a1 Birds of Paradise\u000a4 Lightning Bolt\u000a4 Path to exile\u000a4 Wild Nacatl \u000a1 Oath of Nissa\u000a1 Dromokas command\u000a2 Scavenging ooze\u000a3 Voice of resurgence\u000a3 Loxodon Smiter\u000a2 Kitchen Finks\u000a3 Knight of the reliquary\u000a3 Wilt-leaf liege\u000a2 Elspeth, knight errant\u000a\u000a4 Windswept Heath\u000a4 Wooded Foothills\u000a2 Forest\u000a2 Plains\u000a1 Gavony To wnship\u000a3 Stomping ground\u000a4 Temple Garden\u000a2 Sacred Foundry\u000a1 Kessig Wolf-run\u000a
p272
aVYou can add 2 spaces at the end of each line to make a newline:  \u000a4 Noble Hierarch  \u000a1 Birds of Paradise  \u000a4 Lightning Bolt  \u000a4 Path to exile  \u000a4 Wild Nacatl   \u000a1 Oath of Nissa  \u000a1 Dromokas command  \u000a2 Scavenging ooze  \u000a3 Voice of resurgence  \u000a3 Loxodon Smiter  \u000a2 Kitchen Finks  \u000a3 Knight of the reliquary  \u000a3 Wilt-leaf liege  \u000a2 Elspeth, knight errant  \u000a\u000a4 Windswept Heath  \u000a4 Wooded Foothills  \u000a2 Forest  \u000a2 Plains  \u000a1 Gavony To wnship  \u000a3 Stomping ground  \u000a4 Temple Garden  \u000a2 Sacred Foundry  \u000a1 Kessig Wolf-run  
p273
aVWell, everything gets better after Eldrazi goes away. Maybe Lantern Control gets a little worse but that's it.\u000a\u000aThat said, it's hard to say what's going to get banned. If they ban just one of the lands, the deck is probably still alive, just not as broken as it is. So maybe it's not vanishing, just getting actually balanced. Or, the worst case scenario, they ban one of the lands and the thing still is a little too good.\u000a\u000aWe also have no idea how a metagame without Twin and with a potentially viable-but-not-broken Eldrazi deck would look like, so it's impossible to say whether Zoo is going to be good or not.
p274
aVBushwhacker zoo is really good I won a FNM 5 - 0 without eldrazis. \u000a\u000aAbzan 2-1\u000aTemur Prowess 2-0\u000aTemur Control  2- 1\u000aElves 2 - 0\u000aUSA 2 - 0
p275
aVA friend plays bushwhacker zoo as well and has blown me out a couple times now with that gobliny bastard. I play a grishoalbrand deck, but I like to call it Shoal Train. If I'm fast enough I can beat him before he gets enough threats on the table, but if I have to spend any significant amount of time digging for combo pieces the bushwhacker shows up and ends the game.
p276
aVI started playing Zoo again thanks to bushwacker.  in the past 4 events, I have gone 4-0, 4-0, 3-0-1 and 2-2.  Its a great deck.\u000a\u000aAlso, I played against eldrazi twice last night and beat both.  Going wide got the games for me.  
p277
aVsame man I got bored playing kiki chord then started owning with zoo
p278
aVFellow Bushzoo player here, could you send me your decklist please? 
p279
aVsearch for michael majors zoo. He has a good build
p280
aVWhat version of zoo
p281
aVNaya midrange. With loxodon Smiters, kotr, goyf, birds of paradise, voice of res and a couple collected company. 
p282
aVNaya Company is great in a meta of linear decks since you go over the top and have all the sideboard tools to fight them due to being a GW deck, alongside blood moon to make your tron matchup unlosable if it resolves.  \u000a\u000athe only times you'll really struggle are against decks like Jund or Grixis Delve, whose creatures are very good blockers and have large amounts of removal to drag out the game to the point where they can overwhelm you with card advantage. You'll also struggle against some of the faster combo decks since you end up being a turn too slow to race them and lack the tools to disrupt many of them efficiently (only 8 removal spells, no discard)
p283
aVAh ok so big zoo. It's kinda hard to say how good it will be. It lost one of its better matchup that being twin. The deck has solid game against most aggro and midrange decks but struggles against fast combo. If I had to make a prediction of how good the deck will be post eldrazi i would say it would be a solid tier 2 deck. The deck has a great sideboard and is hard to hate out
p284
aVThe worst thing about the Twin ban and Eldrazi is that we still don't really have a true tier 0 to beat.  We know roughly what things were starting to look like before the PT (more linear decks, Affinity and Infect on the rise, Tron hysteria), but until we know what's going to happen to Eldrazi, we don't really know anything about the Modern Meta.
p285
aVLittle zoo has a great eldrazi match up.

p289
aVWhere's the turbo?
p290
aVThat doesn't make sense, everyone on /r/modernmagic says they have a positive matchup vs eldrazi decks.
p291
aVMaybe we're reading different posts, but I've only people saying "once the eldrazi menace is done" or ignoring them all together. All the anti-eldrazi brews have been pretty subpar.
p292
aVProbably cuz half of them are playtesting on Cockatrice
p293
aVWhen even the anti-eldrazi decks are still not favored against Eldrazi, you know something is very very wrong.
p294
aVThat is how it always works out in broken formats. There are always some people stubborn enough not to just play the best deck.
p295
aVAbout half, as it turns out.
p296
aVBruh, we just gotta give the meta time to sort itself out or something
p297
aVLet's just say that we don't have the finest minds in Modern on the case here. 
p298
aVCause all the finest minds in modern are figuring out which eldrazi variant to play
p299
aVYes. Pending breakthroughs, it seems to be incorrect not to be playing Eldrazi at the moment. 
p300
aVgiven you are a spike.
p301
aVModern is in essence a Johnny Format. Modern is played by Spikes, of course, but as far as a competitive format goes, you need to have your masochist Johnny in the driver-seat if you want to tackle a format that is so full of variance. 
p302
aVIt's been funny how much of the discussion on deckbuilding in this meta has been focused on finding the anti-Eldrazi deck, versus building the best Eldrazi deck. It's not about winning; it's about people trying to prove to themselves that the meta isn't broken.
p303
aVIt's a Johnny thing - invent the bullet to the Eldrazi menace plaguing the format.\u000a\u000aSpikes just use an Eldrazi variant which works in their meta-game. Eldrazi 2 good (from what I hear at least).
p304
aVIf Eldrazi weren't obviously getting banned in April I think you'd see a lot more people trying to build the best Eldrazi deck.  Given the situation, though, why would you invest in Eldrazi?
p305
aVI don't think it's about proving anything at all. We already know that Eldrazi variants are good. What we don't know is what decks are good against the current builds. \u000a\u000aIt makes sense that a larger amount of discussion goes on about the thing we want to find out.\u000a\u000aPlus, people want to find a way to make their $1000 deck competitive in the current metagame.
p306
aVLet's face it. This deck is bonkers. It's like Affinity in its resilience and speed but without its drawbacks: It does not fold to pointed hate (because there is no real pointed hate) and it does not fold to efficient sweepers (Pyroclasm). Also, they have the benefit of manlands AND haste creatures to come back after a sweeper out of nowhere.
p307
aVI've seen absolute beginners to the deck mull to three and pull off wins against tier 1 decks.
p308
aVThere's only 1 tier 1 deck now
p309
aVI think Eldrazi is considered a Tier 0 deck for how dominating it is. It's performance and resilience breaks Tier 1 and moves into Cawblade, Academy level. Play it or the dedicated hate deck, or lose.\u000a\u000a(Not saying Cawblade and Academy are at all on the same power level, just the same relative dominance).
p310
aV>It's performance and resilience breaks Tier 1 and moves into Cawblade\u000a\u000aOk maybe\u000a\u000a>Academy level.\u000a\u000aLol not even close. 
p311
aVIn all fairness there are two. Robots is still a tier one deck. 
p312
aVHow many day 1 decks were Eldrazi?
p313
aVNo one knows. That data doesn't get collected. 
p314
aVSomeone said it was about ~20%-25%. I don't know how accurate that was, but any numbers are better than no numbers.
p315
aVAnyone?
p316
aVThey don't analyze day 1 decks. Nobody wants to go through 700+ entries. 
p317
aVWhich makes the day 2 results statistically worthless.  If it is performing within the margin of error (let's say +/-10% of field - so somewhere between 30-50% of the field in this case), then it isn't a "dominant" deck so much as one that is dominating the number of decks played.  If it performs well outside it - say, 25% of D1 but 50% of D2 - then it is an issue...
p318
aVsure you don't know the conversion rate, but we can also examine historical data to identify outliers. 40% + in day 2 is a statistical outlier. We can safely assume one of two things, both of which are bad. 1. the day 1 % was very high, which lead to a high day 2 %. 2. The day 1 % was not very high, but it had a high day 2 conversion rate.\u000a\u000aBoth scenarios point to problems with the eldrazi deck. Decks don't generally represent much more than 10-15% of day two unless they are overwhelmingly powerful in the format. Past event history shows this holds to be true.
p319
aVIn an open - I'm not going to claim that the decks aren't a problem (there are 4 competitive Eldrazi decks that, while sharing ~28 cards, all play differently - compare to Delver/Twin/Scapeshift, where there is even more commonality between decks), but I am going to say that this is not exactly unprecedented in a format.  \u000a\u000a\u000aIt reminds me most of DDT days in the last gasp of old extended.  It was also a deck that saw a great deal of play, with an over-performing conversion rate - with the caveat that it was ONE deck, with ONE build (~70/75).  Yes, it was eventually banned, and that ban (well, 2 bans) eventually carried into Modern - but that deck was far more powerful than Eldrazi, and far less interesting.\u000a\u000a> Decks don't generally represent much more than 10-15% of day two unless they are overwhelmingly powerful in the format. Past event history shows this holds to be true.\u000a\u000aThis is only true when each deck only makes up 10-15% of the starting decks - it all depends on prevalence and sample rate *within the subgroup of players who have the highest probability of making day 2 in the first place*.  If, say, 75% of the players with previous high finishes in similar events were all on Eldrazi, and they made up ~20% of the field, that throws conversion rate numbers all to hell...\u000a\u000aBasically, I still think the format is evolving to fight the menace.  Is the menace real?  Sure, yes, it is.  Is it unbeatable?  Far from it.  There isn't even a consensus "best version" - UW was most popular, but has a bad RG matchup, and RG other weaknesses as a tradeoff, and so on.  The format **may** still adjust.\u000a\u000aAnecdotally, I don't see much local adaptation, in spite of the power.  Modern is the most popular constructed format in the city in which I live - Madrid, Spain.  People are slowly adapting, but very few are actually playing the spaghetti monsters at the moment - and those of us who are (personally play RG) are actually the players who historically had high win rates in the first place!\u000a\u000aI guess my overall point was that I think that these early events aren't saying much, given the threat of the format.  Competent players are playing scared, either slamming Eldrazi or Affinity and unwilling to commit to unknown solutions.  I mean, we have no conversion numbers for Abzan, Merfolk, Blue Moon, or any other deck that made day 2 any more than we do for Eldrazi.  We don't even have effective day 1 standings to corroborate the Top 32 conversion rate, which may be inflated by exceedingly good day 1 performance...
p320
aV> This is only true when each deck only makes up 10-15% of the starting decks\u000a\u000aHow do you know that? WOTC never releases day 1 metagame numbers and neither does SCG. You have no data to back this conclusion up.\u000a\u000aThe information we do have, what percentages make day 2. We can look at events where the meta wasn't considered 'broken' and events that were, cawblade, mirrodin and see what the percentages were. Numbers based on historical analysis point much more toward the eldrazi is to good than not.
p321
aVVery relevant question. 
p322
aVits simple, wizards just have to print hate a la konami. "The exilammer, mythic, 1C, instant: exile all eldrazi permanents. \u000aflavor text: please dont go, buy this set, we want ur money"
p323
aVThat is kind of surprising there isn't a Back to Nature or Crux of Fate for Eldrazi. Any other time there's been a stopgap, even tho I know it might be a flavor fail
p324
aVu want flavor? sure, "Oath of Zendikar, WUGR, instant, can only be cast if u control gideon, chandra, nissa and jace at the same time (and somehow in a losing position on board), destroy all eldrazi permanents. Through your deck onto the match next to you."

aV"In the interest of competitive diversity, Splinter Twin is banned from Modern."
p329
aVEldrazi taking a huge shit on format diversity doesn't somehow remove the justification for the Splinter Twin ban. 
p330
aVI don't care how many times this comment is reposted.  I'm still salty about the Twin ban and Wizards can fuck themselves.
p331
aVYeah what a pile of crap. Ban a fun, fair card in the interest of diversity and overlook all this power that got pumped into the format. \u000a\u000aNo foresight, no testing... Wanton shakeup motivated by a lust for profit. 
p332
aVI wouldn't call Twin a fair card.  It was the epitome of the broken things that should be allowed, though.  I'll grant them the idea that Pod was restrictive on design space.  It was.  But Twin was the absolute best tempo/control wincon in Modern.  Why?  Because it was the only one that could win consistently and effectively.  *That's what it takes to be a tempo/control wincon in this format.*\u000a\u000aThat said, I'm not sure Twin would keep the Eldrazi menace down.  Eldrazi wins too fast by cheating on mana.  Honestly, it's more akin to the Titan Bloom combo deck, but even faster and more consistent.
p333
aVThis. Your last point about them failing to test is one of the main issues. Wizards is a business, they aren't our friends, we are their customers. Their sole purpose at the end of the day is for them to make money. Having a great product is a huge advantage, but when you "diversify" the meta with banning out a fair deck shit like thus happens. This reminds me of combo winter. Let call this Eldrazi Spring. 
p334
aVDude at the LGS I go to was willing to bet me a box of Eternal Masters that nothing gets banned. I didn't take him up on it because, there's always a chance they try and let the meta adjust, right?\u000a\u000aThinking I may take him up on that offer now....

aV20 out the Top 32 decks (62.5%) were Eldrazi (including the "Eldrazi/Tron hybrid piloted by Zach Voss), showing further enrichment after the Day 2 swiss.\u000a\u000aThe format isn't broken, it's pulverized.
p336
aVEven further than that: 11 out of 16 hit Top 16 (68.75%)\u000a\u000a[In my opinion, it's more prudent to look at Top 16 than Top 8, given that the difference between the two can be just some small tiebreakers. Look at the cut from 8th to 9th: the next non-Eldrazi deck isn't found until 16th, tiebreakers break a different way and we're looking at 5-6 Eldrazi in T8 again.]
p337
aV6 out of top 8 (75%)\u000a\u000a3 out of top 4 (75%)\u000a\u000aBut then it goes downhill from there!\u000a\u000a1 out of top 2 (50%)\u000a\u000a0 champion (0%)\u000a\u000aMan, that's not how statistics works.

This is beyond what Memory Jar was capable of...\u000a\u000aEdit: Why are people so hung up on the memory jar comment? Quit the nitpicking and understand I'm trying to use dramatic analogies to convey that Eldrazi is busted and terrible for the format!
p348
aVSee, I think a ban is reasonable at this point but comments like this make me second guess myself.\u000a\u000aOutside of modern, every card to get an active ban (not start banned) has been much much more warping than the drazi are.
p349
aVYou must be pretty out of touch with modern to not consider them among the most warping cards in the *history* of magic.
p350
aVThey don't make top 10.  That isn't to say something shouldn't be banned but they still can't hold a candle cards as broken as memory jar.
p351
aVAre you fucking joking? The deck that got jar banned is posted below, go goldfish that for a little while then rethink your comment. Memory Jar was banned after 4 months of non  stop combo decks.

aVYou could also very easily argue that Jar would have never needed to be banned if cards like Yawgmoth's Will, Tinker, and Mana Vault were on the ban list where they belong. Jar was the straw that broke the camel's back, but it was not sole reason that deck was busted.
p353
aVSeems like my kind of deck! (still waiting for storm to be viable in modern again...) But unless we see massive tournament numbers drop in the next month, I dont think an emergency ban is warranted. Though I would not be surprised if tournament numbers drops a bit over the next couple months. I know I wont be going to any large tournaments until eldrazi is banned. Why bother showing up if there is no hope?
p354
aVI know a lot of people that regret preregistering for GP Detroit. It seems like a big waste if you're not currently on the Eldrazi deck, and the matches will likely be uninteresting as players with better records will play Eldrazi over and over again.
p355
aVWhich means that the best deck to play is the deck that is the best against all Eldrazi versions - which pretty much means GREld, UWEld, Affinity, or Abzan Company.  So that is a 4-deck format.  Which, honestly, is basically where modern was before - it is just that half of the best decks have 28/75 cards the same...
p356
aV"Bad for the game" seems like a silly argument when literally half the decks in major events are the same and everyone else is wondering when to start selling their "Not-Eldrazi" modern decks.\u000a\u000aI've already stayed home from 2 major modern events waiting for the ban, and there are 2 more yet to go in my area before April 4. That's a lot of money I would have spent on vendors and magic and instead I'm spending it on steam. Everyone else I know who plays modern is doing the same.
p357
aVCan you in all honesty not tell the difference between having 6 weeks of a bad metagame (what you're calling bad for the game) and setting precedence that Wizards should be able to ban any card whenever they want completely outside of the ban schedule (what I'm calling bad for the game)?\u000a\u000aEmergency bannings set a bad precedent, it is bad for the game as a whole. Modern will recover from a rough month and a half and there is currently no indication that tournament attendance has dropped. Your anecdotal evidence doesn't mean shit.
p358
aVwhat precedent are we setting with an emergency ban here? that if a a deck makes up 50% of the meta that it will get banned sooner rather than later?\u000a\u000aexplain to me how that's actually a bad precedent?
p359
aVEasy. The last 2 big surprising bans in modern were Birthing Pod and Splinter Twin. Not every ban is popular, most of them aren't. \u000a\u000a\u000aSo now here you are begging to have bans after a couple weeks of a bad format, and I do agree that it is bad. What does this say to Wizards: we the players are ok with you banning things at will, right away, no schedule needed. Don't take time to collect data, don't take time to see if the format adjusts, don't do anything except ban the cards right away.\u000a\u000aWe have already seen that Wizards will ban stuff to 'shake up' Pro Tours. What happens when next time it isn't such a popular idea to ban a card? Look at Magic like law. As players we DO NOT want Wizards banning shit after a couple weeks as they see fit because next time they do it we might not like the results. It is bad for the game, it is bad for us as players, and it is stupid. \u000a\u000aYes the format blows right now. But Modern will bounce right back, in fact no one has been able to prove tournament or sales numbers have changed. Let's give Wizards time to make a smart informed decision, backed up by good data and tournament results.\u000a\u000aThe format will survive a month and a half of being lame, but making sweeping rules changes, which an emergency ban would be, is much more far reaching.
p360
aVnormally i would agree with you but the environment is so far out of wack that i'm sure most would agree it would be a one-time occurrence...
p361
aVThat isn't how it works unfortunately. Magic is an ever changing game, sometimes there are going to be these rough patches, but I think drastically changing the rules just so 6 weeks of Modern will improve is a bad idea.\u000a\u000a\u000aWizards and the players have a sort of contract and people are begging them to break it. That is a bad idea for us because generally we really want them to stick to the contract. The Eldrazi invasion blows but we shouldn't change the rules over it and neither should they.
p362
aVthe contract that wizard has with it's players is to curate an enjoyable and mostly fair experience.... an emergency ban isn't something that's knee jerk or unreasonable at this point... it's the most rational thing to do so all the players in the format can get on enjoying the game... 
p363
aVWhat contract? Why is everyone so hung up on this idea that WoTC owes them something?
p364
aVThere is already precedent for emergency bans. If there was not, there would not be discussion of emergency bans.\u000a\u000aVendors are losing money and players are facing serious doubt and despair because wizards will not act and that is the reality of the situation. Game stores are losing players and some might not come back. Modern will face a steady decline the longer eldrazi meta as it exists remains legal. This is not arguable.\u000a\u000aThere is little reason to wait other than a boogey man precedent that has long since been broken.
p365
aV>Vendors are losing money and players are facing serious doubt and despair because wizards will not act and that is the reality of the situation.\u000a\u000aThat is a pretty dramatic comment. Please link proof to all of these losses. A lot for people showed up to play modern this weekend. It sounds like you are making shit up to suit your narrative. Lots of people buying into the best deck seems pretty good for venders.
p366
aVI just picked up the owner of my lgs from the airport. His take from magic is down over 50% per week over the last 2 weeks and is considering cancelling his sanctioned modern event next month due to the lack of interest in the format lately.\u000a\u000aThe glass cases are piled high with ogw eldrazi and temples that don't sell because of the imminent ban.\u000a\u000aDo you call people liars irl? I doubt you have the stones.
p367
aVInform your LGS owner that he can sell his Eldrazi staples online. He will have no problem. Listings are ending often and fetching exactly what they are worth (the amount anyone is willing to pay.)
p368
aVI'm opting out of GP detroit unless someone let's me borrow eldrazi. If I can't get that deck ID rather just throw rocks in the air and try to dodge them. It seems about the same as taking a non eldrazi deck to a modern GP at this point. 
p369
aVsame, there's weekly tourneys on a few LGS here but I decided to sit it out, ain't no fun when everyone you know is riding the eldrazy hype train.\u000a\u000aunless there's a ban, I'd probably be sticking on xmage for the next few months.
p370
aVyeah I wasn't even counting FNM modern (Dead) and our usual Wed night lgs modern pods (Dead).\u000a
p371
aVYeah, same here. modern fnm's dead. Last friday I went to my LGS to try and play Modern. there were lots of players there but apparently no one is listing up for Modern.  And when some players saw that I signed up, I was immediately tagged as the "eldrazi" guy since I was the only one eager to play lol.  I was not even playing anything remotely close to eldrazi.
p372
aVI found a couple of casual modern games with friends at least last friday after work. \u000a\u000a"The eldrazi guy" showed up with that free wins twinkle in his eye and everyone finished their games and politely started talking about their draft plans and playing legacy and standard instead lol. Too bad I was starting to enjoy the post-twin meta.
p373
aVI was enjoying the post-twin meta too. I mean it was hectic, but it was fun and filled wih all sorts of cool decks.
p374
aVTo be fair, Jar was legal for less than a month before it was banned.
p375
aVThis isn't beyond what memory jar was capable of, not by a long shot.\u000a\u000aThat being said, in a format like modern, without tools like wasteland and Force of Will, and with bannings such as Jace the Mind Sculptor, Bloodbraid Elf, Preordain, Stoneforge Mystic, and Splinter Twin, what are fair decks suposed to do? You live through the initial onslaught of eldrazi, and then just get buried anyways as you have no tools capable of stabilizing and recovering against them.\u000a\u000aAdditionally, unbanning those cards does basically nothing to fix the meta, because none of those strategies are fast enough to help against eldrazi's openers. Not to mention, Eldrazi hasn't been fully optimized yet, so an even more powerful build may yet surface.\u000a\u000aThe only cards that could be unbaned to fight eldrazi are themselves even more busted, such as the good rituals, blazing shoal, and hypergenesis. These would just serve to make things worse.\u000a\u000aNow consider that memory jar had the potential to secure turn two kills **Consistently**. These eldrazi decks, while being broken in modern, are nowhere near that fundamentally broken. Draw 7 cards is powerful text, discard 7 cards is powerful text, and that was all on one card.\u000a\u000aNow in conclusion, Eldrazi is broken, and needs a ban. No amount of unbannings will fix this format, and the format doesn't have the tools to fight this sort of deck.
p376
aVDoesn't Eldrazi generally fold to a fast Blood Moon?\u000a\u000aR/W Death and Taxes with Moon will crush the Eldrazi menace, calling it now.
p377
aVt3 blood moon will lose still though :/ \u000a\u000a
p378
aVHow do you get a "fast Blood Moon"?  If you play it turn 3 (hell, even if you play it turn 2!), it's probably too late.  By that time, you're facing down at least one big beater, and one of them might've exiled your Blood Moon from your hand before you even got to play it!  And even if you do spend turn 2 or 3 playing Blood Moon, you've just spent a turn playing a card that didn't answer their board one bit.  \u000a\u000aDeath and Taxes player here, so trust me; it's just impossible to disrupt them fast enough, while still building a board presence that kills them fast enough to not let them get right back in the game.
p379

p386
aVBefore the sub goes crazy for the third consecutive week, I really want to know the meta breakdown from day one. This headline is doing a huge disservice to the community without a full story behind it.
p387
aVI don't believe SCG has or ever will share a D1 meta game breakdown for an open, as that's a ton of information to gather. The data we do have is that:\u000a\u000a* 47.7% of the day 2 lists were Eldrazi\u000a* 62.5% of the top 32 lists were Eldrazi\u000a* 50% of the top 8 lists were Eldrazi\u000a\u000aSorry about the disservice???
p388
aVBy no mean was it a slight at you (sorry if it came off that way) but this headline has been making a lot of noise on this sub between yesterday and today. All the Eldrazi talk is just exhausting, and we all know that the subject needs attention. But (and you already know this) if the meta day one was 50-65% Eldrazi to begin with, there is a completely different discussion to have. If that's the case, then the discussion is "are people adapting to the new meta or are people just swapping to Eldrazi for an easy answer?" Or "are people adapting to the new meta by switching to Eldrazi?" But if we don't know the day one, we can't just make an assumption about the state of modern without a bigger picture/full story.\u000a\u000aI think time is something we don't want to accept as a necessity in this, but that's what it's going to take to see things change by either a ban or the format adapting.
p389
aVI've cancelled my plans of going to Detroit and I'm holding off registering for LA until the ban list happens.
p390
aVGood grief.  Has anyone tried packing Ghost Quarters yet and seeing if they can blow up an accellerant or two?  Blood Moon? Fulminator Mage? Heck, Avalanche Riders or Molten Rain?  Anyone have the pieces for Free Win Red want to give it a go at this point?  (I would give it a swing, but that's going to take a couple / six months of disposabe income.  Someone without kids want to sleeve it up?)
p391
aVA "fair" Blood Moon is usually too slow to matter. Some kind of Turbo Red (Moon, Riders, SSG, Molten Rain) could have some game... but then it loses to the other half of the format.
p392
aVThat's why I was thinking "Free Win Red".  Accelerated Moons and Bridges should shut down just about anything but Mono Burn or 8 Rack
p393
aVThere was a Skred list in the top 32, 0 copies of Ensnaring Bridge though like most copies of Free Win Red. As a meta game call I think the deck is fine.
p394
aVI'll have to dig up a field analysis once someone posts one.  Thanks
p395
aVGhost Quarter is garbage. You lose a land while they "lose" a broken land into a basic. They are still up on lands, and you are not.
p396
aVMaking UW Eldrazi have an island instead of an Eye or Temple IS basically costing them a land.  My usual is LoamPox, which is probably why it doesn't seem as bad to me.
p397
aVI am too.  I put a lot of effort into trying to beat the eldrazi menace through ridiculous metagaming and came to the conclusion that there simply aren't the tools to combat something as blatantly powerful as sol lands breaking what are already strong cards.  It's nice seeing my effort validated with so many people trying and failing to stop the deck and I can't wait to see the event where it really is 8 eldrazi in the top 8.  \u000a\u000a48 days to go.
p398
aVYeah, I really hope this finally shuts up all the insanity going around. This deck is not okay. It is beyond question at this point, this deck is the worst thing to happen to the game since combo winter. Worse than affinity and caw blade, because this is modern, not standard.
p399
aVI hate this subreddit.\u000a
p400
aVThere's no one forcing you to come here.
p401
aVI wouldn't say it's worse than Caw Blade. During that time no deck other than Caw Blade had game, at least now Affinity still has some chance.
p402
aVKiki-chord, a deck that was already played and gaining in popularity, has gone like 6-1 against it so far
p403
aVIsn't it objectively more dominant than Caw Blade? \u000a\u000aMaybe it's better to play against, but it wins way more.
p404
aVDuring Caw Blade's day there were a couple decks that had some game. Caw Blade basically had to maindeck 2-3 timely reinforcements because the Goblins deck had insane starts and powerful tools (Lightning Bolt, Goblin Grenade, Goblin Guide, Goblin Bushwacker, Kuldotha Rebirth + Memnite, etc.). It was a pretty consistent turn 4 kill. \u000a\u000aMy friend also teched for caw blade by playing 4 Duress + Surgical Extraction to deal with Jace and Batterskull and used Sphinx of Jwar Isle as a win condition. \u000a\u000aWe both managed a Top 8 finish (me on goblins at 5th, him at 8th) in a format with about 16 caw blade players (the only other ones were 3 Valakut Titan and 1 Venser mill)
p405
aVDon't forget Splinter Twin and Valakut Ramp that both put up results as well during Caw Blade's reign. 
p406
aVWasn't caw blade still a standard deck though? I'd put modern and standard on different levels when it comes to level of brokenness that it takes to get this kind of a result.
p407
aVEldrazi is obviously stronger than cawblade, thing is cawblade might have been the most opressive deck of all time.  You played cawblade or you played another deck to be a special snowflake.  The 75 to take to beat cawblade was the mirror.
p408
aVWhich is funny, considering how many cards from Cawblade are banned in modern.
p409
aVAll 2 of them.
p410
aVYeah I mean it's only the core of the deck right?
p411
aVMy point was Cawblade doesn't have that many cards on the banned list.
p412
aVRight, but you can't go out and make a caw blade deck now.  Both of the cards that made it broken are banned, in addition to preordain.   
p413
aVOkay? I wasn't saying you could...
p414
aVHey, Dont forget Preordain lol. 
p415
aVJace, Stoneforge, Ponder, and Preordain.
p416
aVPonder was in m12, Jace and stoneforge were banned before it was released. So 3 cards.
p417
aVAgreed. Standard deck options are way more limited, especially competitive one's.
p418
aVThe only deck in the format that can reliably use Moxen has a chance is saying something
p419
aVFlash Hulk? Granted it happened right before bannings, but still.
p420
aVRyan Overturf just made a comment: \u000a\u000a"This is a format where Wild Nacatl was banned" after Adam Cummings puked out 3 creatures on turn 1 
p421
aVOverturf quickly becoming a really great person to have in the booth. He's quick, witty, and pretty fun. 
p422
aVWhat are you talking about? The meta did adapt. The UW Eldrazi deck has serious game against other versions of the Eldrazi deck. /s
p423
aV There have been at least 6 different variants of eldrazi in the SCGLOU feature matches (Colorless no Tron, Colorless with tron, UW, UR, GR, and BG). If that isn't diversity I don't know what is.
p424
aV"In the interest of competitive diversity, no more than 3 identical Eldrazi lists may be registered at DCI-sanctioned Modern events."
p425
aVSo I'm happy for different reason as well.\u000a\u000aMost of R&D is going to say that - "ok, Eldrazi are too strong for the format, modern is unable to adapt, ban it and let's move on"\u000a\u000aI'm hoping that a couple of them are going to go a level deeper and ask \u000a\u000a1. "*why* is modern unable to adapt?" \u000a\u000a2. "What is the format missing in various colors that would otherwise allow it to interact efficiently with the problem posed by Eldrazi?"\u000a\u000aThis extraordinarily perceptive R&D member would hopefully be influential enough to push the rest of the team into considering giving modern brand NEW cards that could act as good tools to allow the format to adapt more effectively in the future. \u000a\u000aAs has been mentioned by some people, I'm very happy R&D is willing to push rather than hold-back in regards to design and development. Something that would make me happier is an R&D that acknowledges some of the format-wide weaknesses this experience exposes and doing something to address them. 
p426
aVNo, the problem isn't that the format is unable to adapt...the problem is that Wizards printed this kind of card in the first place. \u000a\u000aThe first run of Eldrazi were bad enough to drive me away from the game - such a card is absolutely UNFUN to play against. I started to get back into it, and then I found out Eldrazi were coming back...drove me away again.\u000a\u000aThe solution is not printing answers to these cards...the solution is not printing these cards in the first place.
p427
aVI disagree. Preemptively nerfing cards means you're going to get a lower power level way into the future.  Then you end up with a wet noodle set of cards. \u000a\u000aWhat is required is exploration and a quick response followed by decisive action.
p428
aVyou give magic r&d entirely way too much credit... i'd gather that they don't spend more than 4 days out of the year devoted to the format... and that's only to type up what they want to ban.... 
p429
aVIt's funny that u think they ask these questions when printing card and pertaining to modern. If they did we wouldn't of had this problem in the first place. They are only about their cash cow standard
p430
aVThey do print some things with the idea of seeing modern play, they just don't test for modern.\u000a\u000aRending Volley was a pretty clear plant from before they decided to ban twin.
p431
aVI completely agree.  Out of curiosity, what would you do to help fix the format?  I know what I would do, but I'm always interested in hearing other opinions and thoughts on how to fix this fundamentally broken format.
p432
aVSure. First thing for me is that I actually think the fundamentals of the format are quite strong.\u000a\u000aThere is a large, ever expanding card pool that was originally self-policing, and because of standard being the only way for cards to enter - the cards are going to come into the format "balanced". \u000a\u000aIn fact, the old cards interacting in new ways with the new cards is a much desired feature, not bug. The issue is that when old cards interact with new cards in a very degenerate and different way. The card pool can generally handle new card interactions (see: ascendency etc) but land-based decks are not within Modern's purview. \u000a\u000aThough I'm not a design expert, I think it'd be good to see some more decent land manipulation (not necessarily removal) that's available to multiple colors (not just blue), some stack interaction that is also available to multiple colors (not just blue) and creative taxing cards that are not necessarily legacy level (things like Gaddock Teeg, thalia, Eidolon of Rhetoric, Lodestone golem for creatures)
p433
aVWhat land manipulation are you speaking of? Just curious. 
p434
aVI assume [[Spreading Seas]] and [[Sea's Claim]].
p435
aVOh right 
p436
aV  \u000a[Sea's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?name=Sea's Claim&type=card&.jpg) - [(G)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea's Claim) [(MC)](http://magiccards.info/query?q=!Sea's Claim)  \u000a[Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?name=Spreading Seas&type=card&.jpg) - [(G)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading Seas) [(MC)](http://magiccards.info/query?q=!Spreading Seas)  \u000a^^^[[cardname]] ^^^or ^^^[[cardname|SET]] ^^^to ^^^call
p437
aVVery sensible approach, I think.  I definitely agree that the land issue is the issue.  Ghost Quarter just doesn't cut it against Eldrazi-level fast mana.  Your options are either GQ their Eye turn 1-2 and set yourself back a land drop and a card, or try to develop your board and let them do the same.  Either way you're falling behind; it's just a matter of how far behind.  \u000a\u000aAs a huge White fanboy, I agree that taxing/rule-setting effects are the way to go with White.  It needs help, and that seems to be the area where it can find its niche.  
p438
aVI'm extremely happy,  it's just more indisputable truth that the core of the deck is broken. Wizards may panic and ban both lands \u000a\u000aI do believe the eldrazi deck puts the GP in Detroit at risk for lower numbers. 
p439
aVEldrazi are pretty much the biggest reason I don't play the game anymore.
p440
aVThey keep banning every deck I play. Soon that may be the biggest reason I don't play. I've moved to Eldrazi just BC they banned twin before that and etc etc before that
p441
aVDude, if you bought into Eldrazi after being burned by bannings before, you're acting like that chick we all know who hates being treated badly by her boyfriend, but keeps going after the same "alpha" type jerks.  \u000a\u000aEveryone knows Eldrazi is gonna get hit with a ban.  You can't legitimately be angry when it is.
p442
aVYou're an idiot if you bought into the deck after the pro tour results \u000a\u000aIf you bought into the deck before oath was released and didn't realize I apologize, that sucks \u000a\u000aStill, this was easy to see coming when oaths spoilers were released
p443
aVI had the modern cards (eye, et, chalice, other lands), I didn't have the standard cards and I bought those. I tried infect, zoo, coco, burn and hated all those decks despite getting 2nd in a GPT two weeks ago with one. If they ban eldrazi without unbanning something I may just drop modern like I did standard and just play the formats they don't artificially or otherwise rotate with bans (vintage/legacy)
p444
aVDo you seriously want them to keep the eldrazi deck around?  I know you're invested in it, but looking at the metagame, do you really want this to continue for another 5 months at minimum?  I'm genuinely curious; I have yet to meet someone who actually doesn't want eldrazi to be reined in.  \u000a\u000aAlso, you picked up modern at a bad time.  After the Twin ban, there became very little reason to play fair in modern and the eldrazi deck has only exacerbated it.  I fully expect more support for fair strategies coming soon; though if I'm wrong, I'm also done with modern.
p445
aVI've been playing magic since 2001 after learning in 98 and have played modern continuously for the past 3 years.  So I didn't just pick it up to be clear. 3 years ago I first got into this format as extended went away. Top 4d my first GPT with Jund zombies. Then they banned DRS. Tried flavors of control, GBx, affinity, tron, living end, pod, etc etc. Found twin and fell in love. Played tarmotwin for 2 years except a period of Doran Abzan and RUG Delver with Treasure Cruise. \u000a\u000aI'm not saying I think it'll be wrong to neuter Eldrazi if Detroit looks like this too. I'm just saying no remaining modern decks make me want to play the format and I'm tired of my decks getting banned so I may just quit the format not out of protest really but disinterest. I want to like the format. I really do. But none of the remaining decks really fit my play style.\u000a\u000aDoes that answer your question clearly and respectfully? That is my intent. I can expand\u000a\u000aEdit: And I even played Twin in legacy FNM 5th Friday last month. I went off 3 times but went 1-2-1 beating burn, drawing against miracles
p446
aVI havea friend who had the same problem. But the problem boils down to you are often taking bestdeck.net and playing it even now with eldrazi. I am suprised you didn't list pod. But when your consistently playing decks like that you put urself in that position. Whether thats right or not is another thing. But its easily avoidable. Ive felt twin was gonna get the hammer eventually for a long time.
p447
aVIf the best deck of the format inevitably gets banned there is a problem with the format.\u000a\u000aModern finally gets to see a real broken deck, wotc played pretty loose with the banlist in modern since inception.  Bbe, twin, nacatal, blossom, even pod aren't real problem cards.  Problem cards dominate a format even when players are trying to beat it.  I hope wotc changes policy so they don't look so stupid at handling formats other than standard.  Both in better testing (seriously, make mimic cost 3 and the deck gets far more reasonable, one of the biggest issues is just how bloodly fast it is) and in using bans when it's important, not for kicks to shake a meta.  It's a testament of how much players want modern to work that it is as popular as it is despite wotc's handling of it.
p448
aVI could see twin coming back tho I understand reasons for the ban. Pod however has been a dominating force especially after its siege rhino inclusion. I really felt it needed to go for the good of the format. Which did suck because it was a great deck. Also keep in mind not every ban kills a deck. DRS is a perfect example of a degenerate card that got banned and jund was still a great deck. I am not trying to get u to agree or keep playing modern. But you should try lookinh at both sides of the coin and consider all the reasons things r done whether or not u like it is really itrelevant.
p449
aVProblem is modern is supposed to be a non-rotating format they are articially rotating in January just to shake it up for the PT :-/
p450
aVI agree to an extent but if u play the not best deck ull be pretty safe
p451
aVThat sounds like an awful limitation.Twin didn't need the ban imo Legacy and vintage it is.  I like those formats..just not as many opportunities to play
p452
aVSo give myself a lower chance to win because otherwise my deck will get banned?  That's a terrible precedent to set for a competitive game.  
p453
aVMy mistake; I had read your comment as stating that you had gotten into Twin recently and then switching to Eldrazi after the ban.  \u000a\u000aYes, your post does pretty perfectly answer my question.  As for your deck history, I can relate pretty heavily, as my path was Jund until DRS ban, UWR/Pod until the Dig/Pod ban, and Twin until the Twin ban.  \u000a\u000aCurrently, I've been experimenting with other decks and Merfolk has been closest to what I'm interested in playing (linear deck is meh, but at least it has some instant-speed play to it), but I'm spending most of my focus on Legacy until Eldrazi goes away.  I can't pretend I know what you like doing in magic, but it might be worth taking a look at if all you've tried lately are members of the gauntlet of linear non-interactive decks that are doing so well these days.  \u000a\u000a
p454
aVWell, I did play mono blue devotion in standard (going 7-1 with it at the invitational standard portion) before dropping standard when they said my cards would only be legal 18 months
p455
aVthe more success the deck has, the easier it is to shut up all the people who think we need to be patiently waiting until april for a ban - which is a ludicrous argument. as long as it continues to be dominant, it will only accelerate the inevitable ban announcement.\u000a\u000aand this only goes to show that the mtgo numbers aren't at all skewed, because the same numbers are showing up at paper events.\u000a\u000agp detroit should be the end of the road for eldrazi, but i'm quite sure that my local LGS is not particularly happy that most of the modern FNM players have decided to stop showing up entirely rather than throw their entry fees away by not playing eldrazi.
p456
aV>I'm just glad the meta didnt adapt as well as everyone said it would.\u000a\u000aWhy? I think I would be happier if the format could exist with the eldrazi decks and they weren't as big of a problem as people were predicting.
p457
aV"I'm happy because nobody will prove I was wrong on the internet!"
p458
aVInterested to see what happens this April. The meta before the colorless eldrazi deck was brought to light (and then many variations since) wasn't that great either - affinity, burn and infect dominating. Better than now at least.
p459
aVBased on what I saw at my store what was doing well before the PT was Scapeshift, Jund, and Jeskai. I mean perhaps small sample size, but it actually seemed kinda promising to me.
p460
aVIf Wizards has some sense they'll unban some midrange and control cards along with the eldrazi ban. AV and BBE are extremely safe to unban, but I could see good arguments for SFM and Sword of the meek as well.
p461
aVI still have to disagree with a BBE unban. I may be biased, but cascading into lili or k-mand seems far too good to me.
p462
aVIn a format where half the decks try to kill you on or before t4 you find the value 4 drop op?
p463
aVI feel like it would leave blue even further behind. As I mentioned in another reply, if blue is given some way to keep up, then BBE would be fine.
p464
aVThat shouldn't be how cards get banned though, all these "balance the format bans," are stupid because they just fuck over these decks and look hypocritical when wotc accidentally breaks something.\u000a\u000aBBE was never a problem, it was very good but it wasn't oppressive.  It got banned because deathrite broke jund and wotc didn't want to ban their new toy.  Which was a moot point because deathrite was broke and ended up getting banned anyway.\u000a\u000aI am worried of BBE's powerlevel with things like kolghan's command but my problem is the reason for BBE's ban was unfounded.  I'm a minimalist, if the reason for its ban is unfounded it should at least come off to be given a chance.
p465
aVI agree that at the time it was banned it was perhaps not the best decision, but at this point in time GBx is already outperforming UWx, so I still would be opposed to BBE coming off unless something similar in power level came off for U as well.
p466
aVI think BBE is more problematic for modern as it stands than SFM. (Particularly with Eldrazi neutered.)
p467
aVEverytime my Coco opponent gets a Finks and Ewitt get back Coco I just sit there thinking "Yea, BBE would be way too strong /s"
p468
aV> I may be biased, but cascading into lili or k-mand seems far too good to me.\u000a\u000aSo what? It's supposed to be powerful, *that's the point*. What's the point of playing a fair deck if you don't get to make powerful plays like that?
p469
aVI guess I see your point. I'm alright with it if blue gets something similar in power level, but as it stands I can't imagine how blue decks are supposed to compete with that.
p470
aVAncestral Vision would give blue decks a pretty amazing tool against the Jund decks playing BBE. A 3-for-1 that requires no tempo loss is crazy good against attrition-based midrange decks that are trying to 1 for 1 you and eventually pull ahead with 2-for-1s (like BBE).\u000a\u000aThe only "loser" in this would possibly be Abzan, but Lingering Souls gives players enough reason to play Abzan in a field with other fair midrange and control decks.
p471
aVBut then you just play Temur with BBE and Ancestral Vision. Cascading into Vision is already a great legacy play, doing so in modern would certainly not increase the diversity of the format.
p472
aVUmm, if it enabled Temur midrange to be a deck, how would that not be increasing diversity?\u000a\u000aAgain, if fair decks don't get the chance to make powerful plays during the midgame, why play a fair deck?
p473
aVBecause Temur midrange would take the place of every other fair deck. No more jund, Abzan, Jeskai control, Grixis Control, Mardu midrange.
p474
aVThat's extremely unlikely. Temur would not suddenly outclass all of those decks. Not playing either black or white means you don't have very good creature removal, and are also going to have a pretty bad time against combo without either hand disruption or good white sideboard cards.
p475
aVIt is powerful, certainly, but there's also a big difference between casting two spells immediately versus casting a spell four turns later, once you get into any sort of late-game situation.
p476
aVOr you just play RUG and cascades into Ancestral Visions and start loving life. 
p477
aVHell yeah. Play 4 Cryptics too.
p478
aVJund already has a lot of amazing tools, and blue has nothing.  That's why jund is a tier 1 deck and UW is just a fun idea with the occasional success.  You could unban just AV, and jund would probably still be better.\u000a\u000a
p479
aVI don't disagree, but my point is that fair decks in general need all the help they can get. This includes both blue and non-blue decks. Both are pretty underpowered compared to the linear strategies in the meta.\u000a\u000aJund is only still tier 1 because a lot of players have invested in the deck and love playing it. Even before the Eldrazi takeover it was fairly weak compared to the rest of the tier 1 decks. I say this as someone who loves Jund to death, btw.
p480
aVBBE would make jund so good that it's unlikely another midrange strategy like grixis or junk or bg Rock ever becomes worth playing. \u000a\u000a\u000aI think we need to wait and see what an actual meta looks like without twin. Now that 3 drops are a thing I think midrange will be able to handle aggro in a non eldrazi format, it's too early to say they need a boost in the new meta IMO. I think jund is going to be very strong once we start seeing Kalitas and bolt paired together
p481
aVI think it's dangerous, but worth trying out.\u000a\u000aThe danger is that it's just the best midrange card available by a lot.\u000a\u000aThe upside is that Bloodbraid probably died for Deathrite's sins so it's worth trying out again.
p482
aVBloodbraid died for lilis sins, tbh.\u000a\u000aBut Lili's too iconic and splashy for it to matter, honestly.
p483
aVLili is the kind of interesting very non-linear engine card that stops the format from degenerating into creatures vs removal though. It would be a shame to take it out of the format even if it is quite strong.
p484
aVI'm not saying she should be banned, and even if I thought that (I really don't - I'd prefer to just unban more things) I still maintain that she's the real reason that DRS and BBE were too strong in jund - Ramping or cascading into her with other upside was just absolutely backbreaking, far moreso than any other play enabled off the pair.
p485
aVCompletely agree with those unbans, except sfm. Tutor+manacheat is exactly what eye does, and Forsythe has said there is a special hell for sfm and jtms. I don't know whether they'd be safe or not but they'll not be coming back as long as he's working there it sounds. 
p486
aVI think the meta *could* actually adapt to the pre-eldrazi post-twin state though.
p487
aVI think we'll see a swing back towards midrange. 
p488
aVYea, me too. Hope so.
p489
aVCompletely agreed. It still was ugly in its state. I scrapped two of my modern decks within the past month from how bad modern has gotten - BW Eldrazi (processor versions are just bad now, and something will get banned to make it worse), and RG Tron (meta is far too aggressive and Tron could also get worse if Eye is banned). All I have left right now is Bogles which is fun once in a while but gets old quick.
p490
aVI hope Eye gets banned and Temple stays around; I have BW too, and I think the deck can still work well without Eye. Thoughtseize, Lingering Souls and Path are all still good cards
p491
aVEye getting banned would leave Tron with a worse control matchup and a pretty much unaffected midrange matchup for what that's worth.
p492
aVI don't really get the sentiment--if the meta did adapt, we get a new deck archetype, nothing wrong with that. Instead we get this dumb vacation to legacy/BDSM intro course.
p493
aVThe Sol lands and Eye aren't the issue. The fact that OGW printed Eldrazi creatures at less than 7-8 mana are what's the issue. When 8 of your creatures can be cast for free, it's not the land's fault. It's been around for years not causing issues like this. Now that a modern (and now legacy too) deck is 80% standard playable is when the issue arises, how is that the land's fault?\u000a\u000aEdit: I'm saying ban Mimic in modern.
p494
aVSo are you suggesting the cards to get rid of are all the bfz and oath eldrazi cards? That seems extreme when there  is 1-2 cards cause all of those others to be as good as they are.
p495
aVNo, I'm thinking just Mimic in modern. Without them you're not dumping multiple free creatures turn one then swinging for 10-20 on turn two with only two lands.
p496
aVThe deck still runs well above everyone else with openers that don't include the mimic.  
p497
aVThe new Eldrazi are actually interesting, fair cards for their cost. The lands are the broken pieces in the deck.
p498
aVA 4/4 with a thoughtseize attached is pushing the limits of broken in its own right. Same with a 5/5 trampler with haste and pseudo-hexproof for 5
p499
aVExcept in previously normal decks they would be very hard to cast because of the colourless requirement. You can't feasibly splash C because you can't fetch for it. The payoff for going C with a splash of colour is the sol lands; if this payoff didn't exist then the downsides (lack of good interaction) would be less attractive.
p500
aVInvesting 4-5 mana on those guys is quite a bit for Modern. It is getting them out on turn 2/3 respectively that is the problem. Tron, Scapeshift, Affinity, Burn, Infect, Zoo... They're all getting ready to kill you by then if you had to tap 4/5 lands for those.
p501
aVYeah, it's quite clear that the deck is much less powerful when the pilot doesn't draw a Sol land. It's forced to play a fair game with cards that, while powerful, are toward the high end of viability in Modern. The number one mistake people make consistently with Eldrazi is being too conservative about mulliganning. Just mull to five if you don't find a Sol land in the first two hands.
p502
aVBecause the land is the enabler. Lion's eye diamond was considered a junk card for years until the right cards came out to abuse it. Now it's one of the linch pins of Legacy's best combo deck. Cards don't exist in a vacuum and you have to look at what card is generating the most degeneracy, and fast mana is probably the most degenerate thing in the game.
p503
aV6 years and BFZ show that it's ridiculously easy to design around eye and temple.  And it didn't take much genius to see how insane TKS and RS were.  As soon as they were spoiled, everyone at my LGS knew bad things were going to happen.
p504
aVAnother post like this? Jesus.
p505
aVI don't see what else there is to discuss about this format right now. \u000a\u000aHowever tired you are of hearing about it, people are far more tired of playing against it.
p506
aVToo many posts about how dominate eldrazi is. Just too many. They don't need to make another post, just go find another post about it and post your thoughts there.
p507
aVThere are too many posts about how there are too many posts about how dominant eldrazi is. Just too many. They don't need to make another post, just go find another post about it and post your thoughts there.
p508
aVToo meta for me.
p509
aVThis comment almost certainly took more time to post than it would have taken you to just scroll past every Eldrazi thread from now until the deck got banned.
p510
aVYeah but I'd like actual content on the subreddit. :^)
p511
aVThis is actual content as much as anything else.
p512
aVAnother  comment like this?  Jesus. \u000a
p513
aV:^)
p514
aVI'm happy, but for different reasons. I really like seeing how people are metagaming and how the Eldrazi decks as well as Abzan coco, merfolk, Kiki chord, etc are all adapting as well. It's similarly interesting as caw-blade was, when each week gerry t and others had new innovations for the tourneys. \u000a\u000aNow, none of the above means that I can't think the format is unhealthy! I do, and hope wotc prints something or bans something to balance it out. With that said, though, I'm enjoying watching how big name players deal with it, whether they succeed or not, mirroring the story of the Zendikari versus the Eldrazi itself. 
p515
aVWith Affinity winning does this dampen the chances for an Eldrazi ban? 
p516
aVI doubt it. Sure, it didn't "win", but the archetype is over represented(and has been in paper and online tournaments), and "hate" cards don't exist. That's enough of a reason for a ban.
p517
aV[deleted]
p518
aVBecause needing more than that much "modification" is a clear indicator of a potentially healthy format.
p519
aVNothing but a bunch of whiney little girls. My god
p520
aVQuit crying and play lantern control. 
p521
aVLantern is not a pure deck with enough interaction\u2122 . This is the wrong subreddit for you.
p522
aVYes, because lantern control players really and truly want to see the mirror happen more often and go 0-0-3 at FNM.
p523
aVThe mirror isn't that bad. Played it on Friday. Finished with 25 minutes left in the round. 
p524
aVI mean, Matter Reshaper seems like literally the best possible card in this deck, I feel like not having 4 of them is just wrong.
p525
aVNo matter reshaper seems very wrong 
p526
aVPlease read the sidebar\u000a\u000a>When posting deck lists, it is generally preferred that you link to a deck building site such as tappedout.net or something similar. Please, make sure you include a description of what your deck is, what it intends to do, and specific questions that stimulate conversation. People are not here to critique the brew you slapped together with zero thought. Try to do some metagame testing to get a feel for your deck so you can talk about it better.
p527
aVNo rational people were calling for a TNN ban in Legacy. 
p528
aVAnd i will never understand their logic. At the end of the day tnn is just 3 mana hard to kill creature
p529
aVReally? Their train of thought seemed pretty transparent to me. The one time they played against it with their deck that hadn't adjusted to TNN they couldn't kill it, and therefore it's too good for Legacy and needs to be banned. 
p530
aV'No RATIONAL people' needs to be stated twice and probably twice again. \u000a\u000aAnyone who actually played legacy in paper just boarded in a few different cards and keep on trucking on. Others on the TNN train sided them out often when they were bad. Apparently this news didn't make it to the internet crowd.\u000a\u000a
p531
aVExactly. You need that filter to be on when you read about Magic on Reddit. If you're not just assuming that most of what you read is unfounded and reactionary, you're just going to get flooded with nonsense. 
p532
aV^
p533
aV/r/MTGLegacy is this way, if that happens. 
p534
aVToo bad the spike from eternal masters announcement made a ton of staples even more expensive. 
p535
aV/r/edh then?\u000a\u000a:D
p536
aVSad part is people are already trying to make eldrazi work in legacy too. Idk about other match ups but it's really good against D&T 
p537
aVWhat? I - What? Really?\u000a\u000aI've been playtesting it, and man, it hardly feels like a "bad" matchup from my side as a DnT player. Between dodging spheres with Vial, and keeping their lands on lock with wasteland/port, it feels way more in my favor than it does against it.\u000a\u000aThe only downside is you don't get the free protection from mom, so you just side her out for more relevant cards.
p538
aVIt's probably fine in Legacy. It's a bit different than the (more popular) Modern versions, since it needs to run Chalice of the Void and Trinisphere to not get demolished by Storm combo, and the fast mana is a little less busted due to the popularity of Wasteland. It is comparable to a deck that has existed for years, MUD, and that deck was never broken. So I think it will be fine in Legacy.\u000a\u000aModern, though? Well, historically, Legacy decks have done very well in Modern...
p539
aVIt's basically a better aggro mud/stompy style deck, something the format could honestly use. It still losses to most unfair matchups since it can't play force. The deck exists in legacy but it will probably not every be oppressive there. 
p540
aVPlaying chalice means your unfair MUs aren't the worst, they do sometimes kill you turn 1 but otherwise, it's rough for them to actually play magic. 
p541
aVYep, seems to be fitting in well power-level wise so far
p542
aVStop playing Modern.
p543
aVno rational people were calling for TNN or Twin to be banned. \u000aEldrazi is getting close to being 50% of the meta. This SCG tournament going on right now is proof that the deck needs something banned (Eye) 
p544
aVThe format will die.
p545
aVHonestly, there's just no way they won't ban Eldrazi. I could MAYBE see them waiting for the next modern PT. They banned Twin saying that it didn't allow any other blue deck, and that it was always winning. If they banned twin to "freshen" the format, then there's just no way they'd let Eldrazi stay.
p546
aVI could see them not banning the eldrazi, but unbanning *a lot* of stuff in the hope that something could keep up and people wouldn't be too grumpy about their decks being banned.
p547
aVPeople will probably stop playing Modern for a while.
p548
aVPlay it or lose most of the time.
p549
aVIt tells me it's time to sell out of modern entirely.  
p550
aVThe format will most likely die as players stop playing it
p551
aVIf they don't ban the Eldrazi, Eternal may really become a thing
p552
aVInstead they print things like [[engineered plague]],  [[wasteland]],  [[innocent blood]], [[chainer's edict]], and/ or [[damnation]] in SO I along with unbanning 80% of the b/r list in order to "shake things up" at next modern pt event and see what happens.
p553
aVChainer's Edict would be an interesting reprint. I'm not sure if any deck would play it though. Also, it would be tough to actually reprint since it references an old character.
p554
aVI would prefer diabolic edict but think the flashback is too flavorful for soi to not choose over diabolic\u000a\u000aAlso chainer was in the block that introduced madness

aVAlmost at the same time as the next ban list update, is the release of Eternal Masters.  Coincidence? 
p558
aVThe intention of EMA is NOT to get a bunch of people into modern. There's going to be a limited set run of EMA and wizards is going to sell 100% of it because the cards are going to be valuable whether more people start playing legacy or not. Wizards isn't going to make huge profits with EMA that are worth destroying a popular format for.

aVDepends on your understanding of a month,  currently only a full month of March is between now and April. 
p563
aVThey will almost certainly not emergency ban anything. The only way I see that happening is if the person organizing GP Detroit literally sends a pair of goons to break some knees over in Renton or if every Modern afficionado mails WotC an envelope full of dog shit.\u000a\u000aWhat would be nice is an acknowledgement that they screwed up and that things will be rectified come April.\u000a\u000aIn the meantime, I will be enjoying my new hobby, [Netrunner](/r/netrunner).

aVYou don't by any chance happen to have Aaron Forsythe's home mailing address do you?\u000a
p567
aVPeople aren't leaving the game.\u000a\u000aThe ONLY time Wizards has done an emergency ban was when 1. Fewer people overall played the game and 2. People were leaving because the format (standard) was so degenerate. \u000a\u000aGuess what? People aren't leaving... These cards we are seeing in Modern are being printed in a standard (a format the is NOT broken) legal set and WotC is probably going to show one of the best Q1s in their history. Why in the hell would they do an emergency ban? 
p568
aVHard to compare standard to modern using the same cards. As modern has lands that break the cards like eye of ugin and eldrazi temple. If standard has those lands in the block you guys would all be playing eldrazi or bitching that it's too strong
p569
aVIt is hard, because WotC makes more money off of Standard. People too often WotC isn't here to make the format better immediately after there is a problem. WotC is here to make money. Packs are flying off the shelves and people aren't leaving the game.\u000a\u000aEmergency bans don't make money, the ONLY emergency ban in history was done to get people to invest in the game again. If I remember correctly, you could actually mail in your memory jars to WotC and they would send you a brand new sealed booster. That's how badly they wanted people to come back.\u000a\u000aThey will wait until April. If anyone left, they will most likely come back once the format has been corrected.
p570
aVAn emergency ban to fix a non-Standard format would take even more broken-ness. That and it would hurt player confidence in Modern (which's not exactly good) even more.
p571
aVEither way people lose confidence. Emergency bans tell players their cards can be banned at any moment; not banning obviously broken cards is neglecting the format. People who bought Eldrazi to spike the GPs will be annoyed if it's killed; people who didn't will be annoyed if they have to play against it. There's no course of action now that keeps everyone happy. The solution is not making catastrophic development mistakes. It's hard to get that toothpaste back in the tube though. \u000a\u000aPersonally, I think the Modern playerbase is sophisticated enough to understand that we're in a unique situation. An emergency ban on Eye doesn't mean players need to fear a snap-ban of their Platings, for example. Modern players are also invested enough that they're motivated to stay long-term. As such, I don't think either course of action dooms the format. I would prefer to see them save the March GPs. If even if they don't, I won't be leaving the format. I'm guessing most others won't either. 
p572
aVI fully agree. Both options are going to hurt player confidence, but my impression from following people like Aaron Forsythe, Sam Stoddard and Mark Rosewater on social media is that they think an emergency ban would be the worse option.\u000a\u000aPersonally I'd rather see these cards go before the GPs, but that's very unlikely to happen.\u000a\u000aI also agree that the appeal and demand for a format like Modern is so big that it will still grow even as WotC screws up managing it all the time.
p573
aVI say they wait at the very least until the next Modern Grand Prix. No need for an emergency ban at the moment. Mirrodin Standard was more degenerate. Combo Winter was more degenerate. This meta is bad don't get me wrong, but nowhere near the other two metas I mentioned. 
p574
aVThis is far more degenerate than combo winter or mirrodin standard.
p575
aVI suspect that's only because in Modern it's very cost-prohibitive to switch decks. Otherwise 50% or more of the field would play some variant. 
p576
aVIsn't nearly 50% already playing it? I could be wrong, but I seem to remember a stat that said 47% somewhere.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aI agree with it being cost prohibitive to switch. I just went to standard for a while until things calm down.
p577
aV47% of the people in day 2 of the last SCG open were on eldarzi 
p578
aVThat was the Day Two meta breakdown at the most recent SCG Open
p579
aVThe problem with emergency bans is that it tells players that their cards can be effectively be taken away from them at any time. This shakes peoples confidence in the game, and the feel-bads of a ban out of nowhere when people have just bought in to a deck can cause them to quit entirely. One of the keys to keeping people involved in something is to have as few exit points as possible - and in Magic, a banning is an exit point because it means someone no longer gets to play the way they want to.\u000a\u000aAlso, by only banning things at predetermined times throughout the year, players can acquire cards and know what the minimum amount of time they'll have to play them is. Of course, unexpected bannings produce a similar result. No one worried for very long about the health of the format when Birthing Pod got banned, because people were starting to believe the deck might be too powerful. But this year, Splinter Twin got banned and people got scared because it seemed to be from out of nowhere. The simultaneous Summer Bloom ban is never the meat of their evidence for why they worry, and that's because part of Amulet Bloom was *expected* to be banned. \u000a\u000aAnd imagine if you were a Twin player who bought in to Eldrazi only to see it another unexpected banning - who could blame you for your faith in Modern being destroyed, or if you walked away from Magic entirely?\u000a\u000aWizards of the Coast knows those things. The emergency ban of [[Memory Jar]] came about because the game was in such bad shape that the ban *increased* confidence in the game rather than decreased it. For context: they had tons of people leave the game during Combo Winter when if your deck didn't have a turn two kill, it was too slow. (Heck, I was one of them; I didn't come back for years). Urza's Saga came out in October 1998; [[Tolarian Academy]] and [[Windfall]] were banned in December because there were a ton of cheap artifacts and fast mana; 6 mana available turn one was no big deal and Windfall just meant you could draw 7 cards because your opponent hadn't had a turn yet but you'd just played out your entire hand. Those bans weren't enough, and March saw the [[Dream Halls]], [[Earthcraft]], [[Fluctuator]], [[Lotus Petal]], [[Recurring Nightmare]], and [[Time Spiral]] get banned and power level errata for creatures like [[Cloud of Faeries]] (which were revoked in 2006), and Standard was finally in decent shape. The only time Wizards has banned more cards at once was when they defanged affinity - and three quarters of those cards were the artifact lands. Just after the March 1999 regular bannings, the Memory Jar (from the just relased Urza's Legacy) / [[Megrim]] combo emerged and it was just as fast as the other combos thanks to things like [[Tinker]]. A new combo threatened to undo the work the bans were starting to do to restore confidence in the game, so it had to go. Modern isn't in good shape at the moment but it's nowhere near that bad, and the Banned and Restricted list update coming April 4 means the Eldrazi menace will have only lasted for two months rather than the 5-6 that Combo Winter lasted. If they only ban one of the two Eldrazi lands and Eldrazi decks are just as oppressive, *then* we may see an emergency ban.

aVhttp://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/extended-thoughts-2003-11-14\u000a\u000aI want you to read that entire article before you respond to me (if ever you do).\u000a\u000aNow to answer your question, the reason Eldrazi hasn't caused an emergency banning is threefold:\u000a\u000a* It isn't dominant in Standard, Modern, Legacy, **AND** Vintage. Only modern is being plagued by the deck.\u000a\u000a* Magic: the Gathering is **NOT** fresh off of a game wide broken Era such as combo winter. Before now, all formats were healthy.\u000a\u000a* Failing to emergency ban Eldrazi right this instant does **NOT** threaten to kill the game off. Magic as a game was in a really shaky place when [[Memory Jar]] was printed. Another couple months of that type of degenerate game play threatened to cause players to quit the game, across all formats, in a time when the game had little chance to recover from such a blow to fan base confidence.\u000a\u000aTo conclude my statement, while Eldrazi is a degenerate deck, and certainly warrants a ban of some sort **AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME** , Wizards wisely understands that an itchy trigger finger on the ban hammer would do much more harm than good with regard to restoring customer confidence in the game. People are already salty enough about misguided bannings in modern and forcefully retiring their favorite decks, showing the community that cards could be banned at any moment would just rub more salt in that already open, weeping wound.

aVBecause it sets a bad precedent.\u000a\u000aBreaking the B&R schedule only fuels this talk the next time something broken comes out. We'll be in the exact same spot except there's 2 cards to point to when calling for emergency bans. \u000a\u000a*Even if*, these numbers are combo winter levels of degeneracy, MtG is much bigger now. WotC is not going to kill the MtG brand by waiting a month and a half. \u000a\u000aThis also isn't standard; it's not an on ramp for MtG so they're not too worried about losing new players. Despite your frustration; it sounds like you're still going to Detroit. Not only are you not leaving magic, you're not even leaving the format.\u000a\u000aJust be patient; it'll blow over.
p584
aVIf something breaks to the same extent I'd want it emergency banned as well. What is wrong with recognizing degeneracy in the format and attempting to fix it as problems arise?
p585
aVIf only there were some sort of system in place to deal with degenerate decks...
p586
aVIt's not a degenerate deck. Amulet was degenerate. Storm was a bit degenerate.\u000a\u000aThis is broken.
p587
aVFor context: [This is jar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2IZ5OOJx0M). You may disagree, but eldrazi is no jar. I'm far more comfortable comparing it to TC delver, storm and amulet than jar. \u000a\u000aBroken? Degenerate? Is there a scale I'm not aware of? Was twin *imba* but not quite degenerate-tier? How do you measure the difference? How does this translate to other games? This raises so many questions.\u000a\u000aThe most important difference is that worst case scenario, eldrazi kills modern. Compared to, worst case scenario, jar kills mtg.
p588
aVUpcoming modern gp weekend. 
p589
aVThe only reason to do an emergency banning is if they are legitimately scared for the health of the game. Sure, Modern sucks right now, but the attendance at SCG Louisville was pretty high, and we'll see how the attendance is at the modern GPs soon. April isn't that far away, and if the game's health isn't in danger, they will (and should) wait until then.
p590
aVThere has only ever been one emergency ban in the history of Magic. It's not clear what will make them do it again. This isn't the most broken a format has been since Urza's Legacy, and those more broken formats didn't cause emergency bans. \u000a\u000a"The format is unhealthy" isn't good enough for an emergency ban, because again, formats have been much more unhealthy than this and not caused them. 
p591
aV>This isn't the most broken a format has been since Urza's Legacy, and those more broken formats didn't cause emergency bans.\u000a\u000aYes it is. Since Urza's Legacy. 
p592
aVYea, they have, and that's a problem. So I'm asking why not take the steps to correct the problem? Why not make the ban now so people will have more fun and player confidence in wizards ability to actually recognize what is broken and what isn't (ala twin) is established. Why is an emergency ban such hollowed ground when the format is clearly broken?
p593
aVBecause if they do it once, people will ask/fear for an emergency ban every time a deck does well. 
p594
aVAnd if that deck does as well as this it should also be banned off-schedule. If it isn't then they just won't do it. They're not slaves to our will or the reserved list would never have existed.
p595
aVThey didnt even emergency ban caw blade when it was 80% of the meta. So there is no reason to emergency ban this. Yes its strong, but april isnt that long of a wait.
p596
aVThat's because Caw-Blade was fun and skill-intensive even if it got a bit boring after a while. And it wasn't 80% of the meta.
p597
aVhttp://modernnexus.com/on-banning-and-beating-eldrazi/ Says it better than I do. Wizards has to identify the problem cards, and a few months of horrible meta game isn't really the end of the world
p598
aVThe problem card is Eye of Ugin.
p599
aVWizards probably have already identified the problem cards through MTGO. MTGO provides more actionable data for them than watching the few matches from GP/Open coverage. MTGO has hundreds(if not more) of Modern matches each day. They've probably collected more data from the Modern league in the weeks since the pro tour than there will be collectively at the three GPs in March.
p600
aVWhat do think the chances  are that something in the deck doesn't get banned. If it does, at what point do you see  people already losing all the value from the deck? I have already seen  2 stores in my area, that won't trade or buy for Eye or Temple unless they have someone waiting to buy it. I know most of the rest will still maintain some value, as they are decent in standard. I personally think, at this point if you have the deck for the up coming GP, unless you win it or cash well, you are pretty much in the same boat as if they banned it today. What do you think?
p601
aVIf something in the deck doesn't get banned then the format dies.
p602
aVBasically wizards dons't want to admit they are stupid and fucked up. So we have to wait on the usual timeline.
p603
aVSelling OTG packs.
p604
aVEmergency Bans are only for things that the Meta cannot adjust to. Clearly the meta can adjust, we just need to wait. Until April. When the bans come. And the list will include: Cranial Plating and Simian Spirit Guide. That's it. Nothing Else. Meta will continue to adjust.
p605
aVSimian Spirit Guide is good for Magic. It helps combo decks. Combo decks are a good thing, because they punish the linear aggro decks that dominate Modern. 
p606
aV'Twas a joke. But yeah I completely agree. The combo decks took the place of Twin in the "don't just tap out now, I might go off next turn".
p607
aVThe issue with the enchantment decks typically is you can't get enough card selection to win consistently without giving up too much tempo to win consistently. Matchups hinge on cards like ghostly prison or suppression field, but if you don't hit the key card on curve you just get annihilated.   \u000a\u000aThe only way you're beating eldrazi is RW prison in my opinion, with blood moons, chained to the rocks and journey to nowhere. You need to reliably be killing stuff or shutting them down every game.  \u000a\u000aI had some really, really good luck with the RW version with Starfield+Journey+outpost siege combo back when I was working on this archetype, and being able to interact early with chained and journey was the key to success.
p608
aVI've run my Mono-White and Boros Enchantment Control decks a few times at my LGS, which has been swarming with Eldrazi players since the Pro Tour.\u000a\u000aIt's just...okay.  Porphyry Nodes is often too slow when the Eldrazi player is able to smash you for 8-12 damage on turn two, and it takes time to whittle away their creatures.  By the time you do, you might be nearly dead.  Ghostly Prison is fine, but you can't hide behind it forever; eventually the Eldrazi player is just going to draw enough lands to pay the tax and attack you.  Since Stax-type builds struggle to close out the game quickly anyway, it's not as favourable as you'd think. \u000a\u000a Really the only surefire way of winning is if you manage to stick a Sphere of Safety or an Ensnaring Bridge, but post-sideboard the Eldrazi player is going to have ways to deal with them.  And if you don't draw them, you're just going to eventually get smashed.  You basically have to get lucky draws and a good opening hand to carry the day.\u000a\u000aThe plus side is that Chalice of the Void is often dead against a deck like Enchantment Control, as most relevant targets cost three mana.  Additionally, main deck Leyline of Sanctity can shut off Thought-Knot Seer, and Runed Halo is an incredibly versatile card.  For the most part, though, you're completely at the mercy of variance.  They either kill you before you can set up or you draw well and stall long enough to field threats.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I've had much more success with Martyr-Proc than with any kind of Stax build.  You have a ton of life gain, main deck wraths to deal with threats, and an endless stream of chump-blockers by recurring Squadron Hawks.  Plus, there are very few ways an Eldrazi player can deal with a 6/6 Serra Ascendant on the battlefield.  Even if they Chalice for one, you can just Proc your one-drops from the graveyard to the battlefield without casting them.
