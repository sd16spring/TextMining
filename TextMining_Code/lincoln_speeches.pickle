ILIAD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nNo man since Washington has become to Americans so familiar or so\r\nbeloved a figure as Abraham Lincoln. He is to them the representative\r\nand typical American, the man who best embodies the political ideals of\r\nthe nation. He is typical in the fact that he sprang from the masses of\r\nthe people, that he remained through his whole career a man of the\r\npeople, that his chief desire was to be in accord with the beliefs and\r\nwishes of the people, that he never failed to trust in the people and to\r\nrely on their support. Every native American knows his life and his\r\nspeeches. His anecdotes and witticisms have passed into the thought and\r\nthe conversation of the whole nation as those of no other statesman have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nHe belongs, however, not only to the United States, but to the whole of\r\ncivilized mankind. It is no exaggeration to say that he has, within the\r\nlast thirty years, grown to be a conspicuous figure in the history of\r\nthe modern world. Without him, the course of events not only in the\r\nWestern hemisphere but in Europe also would have been different, for he\r\nwas called to guide at the greatest crisis of its fate a State already\r\nmighty, and now far more mighty than in his days, and the guidance he\r\ngave has affected the march of events ever since. A life and a character\r\nsuch as his ought to be known to and comprehended by Europeans as well\r\nas by Americans. Among Europeans, it is especially Englishmen who ought\r\nto appreciate him and understand the significance of his life, for he\r\ncame of an English stock, he spoke the English tongue, his action told\r\nupon the progress of events and the shaping of opinion in all British\r\ncommunities everywhere more than it has done upon any other nation\r\noutside America itself.\r\n\r\nThis collection of Lincoln\'s speeches seeks to make him known by\r\nhis words as readers of history know him by his deeds. In\r\npopularly-governed countries the great statesman is almost of necessity\r\nan orator, though his eminence as a speaker may be no true measure\r\neither of his momentary power or of his permanent fame, for wisdom,\r\ncourage and tact bear little direct relation to the gift for speech. But\r\nwhether that gift be present in greater or in lesser degree, the\r\ncharacter and ideas of a statesman are best studied through his own\r\nwords. This is particularly true of Lincoln, because he was not what may\r\nbe called a professional orator. There have been famous orators whose\r\nspeeches we may read for the beauty of their language or for the wealth\r\nof ideas they contain, with comparatively little regard to the\r\ncircumstances of time and place that led to their being delivered.\r\nLincoln is not one of these. His speeches need to be studied in close\r\nrelation to the occasions which called them forth. They are not\r\nphilosophical lucubrations or brilliant displays of rhetoric. They are a\r\npart of his life. They are the expression of his convictions, and derive\r\nno small part of their weight and dignity from the fact that they deal\r\nwith grave and urgent questions, and express the spirit in which he\r\napproached those questions. Few great characters stand out so clearly\r\nrevealed by their words, whether spoken or written, as he does.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Lincoln\'s discourses are not like those of nearly all the\r\nmen whose eloquence has won them fame. When we think of such men as\r\nPericles, Demosthenes, \xc3\x86schines, Cicero, Hortensius, Burke, Sheridan,\r\nErskine, Canning, Webster, Gladstone, Bright, Massillon, Vergniaud,\r\nCastelar, we think of exuberance of ideas or of phrases, of a command of\r\nappropriate similes or metaphors, of the gifts of invention and of\r\nexposition, of imaginative flights, or outbursts of passion fit to stir\r\nand rouse an audience to like passion. We think of the orator as gifted\r\nwith a powerful or finely-modulated voice, an imposing presence, a\r\ngraceful delivery. Or if--remembering that Lincoln was by profession a\r\nlawyer and practised until he became President of the United States--we\r\nthink of the special gifts which mark the forensic orator, we should\r\nexpect to find a man full of ingenuity and subtlety, one dexterous in\r\nhandling his case in such wise as to please and capture the judge or the\r\njury whom he addresses, one skilled in those rhetorical devices and\r\nstrokes of art which can be used, when need be, to engage the listener\'s\r\nfeelings and distract his mind from the real merits of the issue.\r\n\r\nOf all this kind of talent there was in Lincoln but little. He was not\r\nan artful pleader; indeed, it was said of him that he could argue well\r\nonly those cases in the justice of which he personally believed, and was\r\nunable to make the worse appear the better reason. For most of the\r\nqualities which the world admires in Cicero or in Burke we should look\r\nin vain in Lincoln\'s speeches. They are not fine pieces of exquisite\r\ndiction, fit to be declaimed as school exercises or set before students\r\nas models of composition.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are their merits? and why do they deserve to be valued and\r\nremembered? How comes it that a man of first-rate powers was deficient\r\nin qualities appertaining to his own profession which men less\r\nremarkable have possessed?\r\n\r\nTo answer this question, let us first ask what were the preparation and\r\ntraining Abraham Lincoln had for oratory, whether political or forensic.\r\n\r\nBorn in rude and abject poverty, he had never any education, except what\r\nhe gave himself, till he was approaching manhood. Not even books\r\nwherewith to inform and train his mind were within his reach. No school,\r\nno university, no legal faculty had any part in training his powers.\r\nWhen he became a lawyer and a politician, the years most favourable to\r\ncontinuous study had already passed, and the opportunities he found for\r\nreading were very scanty. He knew but few authors in general literature,\r\nthough he knew those few thoroughly. He taught himself a little\r\nmathematics, but he could read no language save his own, and can have\r\nhad only the faintest acquaintance with European history or with any\r\nbranch of philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe want of regular education was not made up for by the persons among\r\nwhom his lot was cast. Till he was a grown man, he never moved in any\r\nsociety from which he could learn those things with which the mind of an\r\norator or a statesman ought to be stored. Even after he had gained some\r\nlegal practice, there was for many years no one for him to mix with\r\nexcept the petty practitioners of a petty town, men nearly all of whom\r\nknew little more than he did himself.\r\n\r\nSchools gave him nothing, and society gave him nothing. But he had a\r\npowerful intellect and a resolute will. Isolation fostered not only\r\nself-reliance but the habit of reflection, and, indeed, of prolonged and\r\nintense reflection. He made all that he knew a part of himself. He\r\nthought everything out for himself. His convictions were his own--clear\r\nand coherent. He was not positive or opinionated, and he did not deny\r\nthat at certain moments he pondered and hesitated long before he decided\r\non his course. But though he could keep a policy in suspense, waiting\r\nfor events to guide him, he did not waver. He paused and reconsidered,\r\nbut it was never his way either to go back upon a decision once made, or\r\nto waste time in vain regrets that all he expected had not been\r\nattained. He took advice readily, and left many things to his ministers;\r\nbut he did not lean upon his advisers. Without vanity or ostentation, he\r\nwas always independent, self-contained, prepared to take full\r\nresponsibility for his acts.\r\n\r\nThat he was keenly observant of all that passed under his eyes, that his\r\nmind played freely round everything it touched, we know from the\r\naccounts of his talk, which first made him famous in the town and\r\nneighbourhood where he lived. His humour, and his memory for anecdotes\r\nwhich he could bring out to good purpose, at the right moment, are\r\nqualities which Europe deems distinctively American, but no great man of\r\naction in the nineteenth century, even in America, possessed them in the\r\nsame measure. Seldom has so acute a power of observation been found\r\nunited to so abundant a power of sympathy.\r\n\r\nThese remarks may seem to belong to a study of his character rather than\r\nof his speeches, yet they are not irrelevant, because the interest of\r\nhis speeches lies in their revelation of his character. Let us, however,\r\nreturn to the speeches and to the letters, some of which, given in this\r\nvolume, are scarcely less noteworthy than are the speeches.\r\n\r\nWhat are the distinctive merits of these speeches and letters? There is\r\nless humour in them than his reputation as a humorist would have led us\r\nto expect. They are serious, grave, practical. We feel that the man does\r\nnot care to play over the surface of the subject, or to use it as a way\r\nof displaying his cleverness. He is trying to get right down to the very\r\nfoundation of the matter and tell us what his real thoughts about it\r\nare. In this respect he sometimes reminds us of Bismarck\'s speeches,\r\nwhich, in their rude, broken, forth-darting way, always go straight to\r\ntheir destined aim; always hit the nail on the head. So too, in their\r\neffort to grapple with fundamental facts, Lincoln\'s bear a sort of\r\nlikeness to Cromwell\'s speeches, though Cromwell has far less power of\r\nutterance, and always seems to be wrestling with the difficulty of\r\nfinding language to convey to others what is plain, true and weighty to\r\nhimself. This difficulty makes the great Protector, though we can\r\nusually see what he is driving at, frequently confused and obscure.\r\nLincoln, however, is always clear. Simplicity, directness and breadth\r\nare the notes of his thought. Aptness, clearness, and again, simplicity,\r\nare the notes of his diction. The American speakers of his generation,\r\nlike most of those of the preceding generation, but unlike those of that\r\nearlier generation to which Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, Marshall and\r\nMadison belonged, were generally infected by a floridity which made them\r\na by-word in Europe. Even men of brilliant talent, such as Edward\r\nEverett, were by no means free from this straining after effect by\r\nhighly-coloured phrases and theatrical effects. Such faults have to-day\r\nvirtually vanished from the United States, largely from a change in\r\npublic taste, to which perhaps the example set by Lincoln himself may\r\nhave contributed. In the forties and fifties florid rhetoric was\r\nrampant, especially in the West and South, where taste was less polished\r\nthan in the older States. That Lincoln escaped it is a striking mark of\r\nhis independence as well as of his greatness. There is no superfluous\r\nornament in his orations, nothing tawdry, nothing otiose. For the most\r\npart, he addresses the reason of his hearers, and credits them with\r\ndesiring to have none but solid arguments laid before them. When he does\r\nappeal to emotion, he does it quietly, perhaps even solemnly. The note\r\nstruck is always a high note. The impressiveness of the appeal comes not\r\nfrom fervid vehemence of language, but from the sincerity of his own\r\nconvictions. Sometimes one can see that through its whole course the\r\nargument is suffused by the speaker\'s feeling, and when the time comes\r\nfor the feeling to be directly expressed, it glows not with fitful\r\nflashes, but with the steady heat of an intense and strenuous soul.\r\n\r\nThe impression which most of the speeches leave on the reader is that\r\ntheir matter has been carefully thought over even when the words have\r\nnot been learnt by heart. But there is an anecdote that on one occasion,\r\nearly in his career, Lincoln went to a public meeting not in the least\r\nintending to speak, but presently being called for by the audience, rose\r\nin obedience to the call, and delivered a long address so ardent and\r\nthrilling that the reporters dropped their pencils and, absorbed in\r\nwatching him, forgot to take down what he said. It has also been stated,\r\non good authority, that on his way in the railroad cars, to the\r\ndedication of the monument on the field of Gettysburg, he turned to a\r\nPennsylvanian gentleman who was sitting beside him and remarked, "I\r\nsuppose I shall be expected to say something this afternoon; lend me a\r\npencil and a bit of paper," and that he thereupon jotted down the notes\r\nof a speech which has become the best known and best remembered of all\r\nhis utterances, so that some of its words and sentences have passed into\r\nthe minds of all educated men everywhere.\r\n\r\nThat famous Gettysburg speech is the best example one could desire of\r\nthe characteristic quality of Lincoln\'s eloquence. It is a short speech.\r\nIt is wonderfully terse in expression. It is quiet, so quiet that at the\r\nmoment it did not make upon the audience, an audience wrought up by a\r\nlong and highly-decorated harangue from one of the prominent orators of\r\nthe day, an impression at all commensurate to that which it began to\r\nmake as soon as it was read over America and Europe. There is in it not\r\na touch of what we call rhetoric, or of any striving after effect. Alike\r\nin thought and in language it is simple, plain, direct. But it states\r\ncertain truths and principles in phrases so aptly chosen and so\r\nforcible, that one feels as if those truths could have been conveyed in\r\nno other words, and as if this deliverance of them were made for all\r\ntime. Words so simple and so strong could have come only from one who\r\nhad meditated so long upon the primal facts of American history and\r\npopular government that the truths those facts taught him had become\r\nlike the truths of mathematics in their clearness, their breadth, and\r\ntheir precision.\r\n\r\nThe speeches on Slavery read strange to us now, when slavery as a living\r\nsystem has been dead for forty years, dead and buried hell deep under\r\nthe detestation of mankind. It is hard for those whose memory does not\r\ngo back to 1865 to realize that down till then it was not only a\r\nterrible fact, but was defended--defended by many otherwise good men,\r\ndefended not only by pseudo-scientific anthropologists as being in the\r\norder of nature, but by ministers of the Gospel, out of the sacred\r\nScriptures, as part of the ordinances of God. Lincoln\'s position, the\r\nposition of one who had to induce slave-owning fellow-citizens to listen\r\nto him and admit persuasion into their heated and prejudiced minds, did\r\nnot allow him to denounce it with horror, as we can all so easily do\r\nto-day. But though his language is calm and restrained, he never\r\ncondescends to palter with slavery. He shows its innate evils and\r\ndangers with unanswerable force. The speech on the Dred Scott decision\r\nis a lucid, close and cogent piece of reasoning which, in its wide view\r\nof Constitutional issues, sometimes reminds one of Webster, sometimes\r\neven of Burke, though it does not equal the former in weight nor the\r\nlatter in splendour of diction.\r\n\r\nAmong the letters, perhaps the most impressive is that written to Mrs.\r\nBixley, the mother of five sons who had died fighting for the Union in\r\nthe armies of the North. It is short, and it deals with a theme on which\r\nhundreds of letters are written daily. But I do not know where the\r\nnobility of self-sacrifice for a great cause, and of the consolation\r\nwhich the thought of a sacrifice so made should bring, is set forth with\r\nsuch simple and pathetic beauty. Deep must be the fountains from which\r\nthere issues so pure a stream.\r\n\r\nThe career of Lincoln is often held up to ambitious young Americans as\r\nan example to show what a man may achieve by his native strength, with\r\nno advantages of birth or environment or education. In this there is\r\nnothing improper, nothing fanciful. The moral is one which may well be\r\ndrawn, and in which those on whose early life Fortune has not smiled may\r\nfind encouragement. But the example is, after all, no great\r\nencouragement to ordinary men, for Lincoln was an extraordinary man.\r\n\r\nHe triumphed over the adverse conditions of his early years because\r\nNature had bestowed on him high and rare powers. Superficial observers\r\nwho saw his homely aspect and plain manners, and noted that his\r\nfellow-townsmen, when asked why they so trusted him, answered that it\r\nwas for his common-sense, failed to see that his common-sense was a part\r\nof his genius. What is common-sense but the power of seeing the\r\nfundamentals of any practical question, and of disengaging them from the\r\naccidental and transient features that may overlie these\r\nfundamentals--the power, to use a familiar expression, of getting down\r\nto bed rock? One part of this power is the faculty for perceiving what\r\nthe average man will think and can be induced to do. This is what keeps\r\nthe superior mind in touch with the ordinary mind, and this is perhaps\r\nwhy the name of "common-sense" is used, because the superior mind seems\r\nin its power of comprehending others to be itself a part of the general\r\nsense of the community. All men of high practical capacity have this\r\npower. It is the first condition of success. But in men who have\r\nreceived a philosophical or literary education there is a tendency to\r\nembellish, for purposes of persuasion, or perhaps for their own\r\ngratification, the language in which they recommend their conclusions,\r\nor to state those conclusions in the light of large general principles,\r\na tendency which may, unless carefully watched, carry them too high\r\nabove the heads of the crowd. Lincoln, never having had such an\r\neducation, spoke to the people as one of themselves. He seemed to be\r\nsaying not only what each felt, but expressing the feeling just as each\r\nwould have expressed it. In reality, he was quite as much above his\r\nneighbours in insight as was the polished orator or writer, but the\r\nplain directness of his language seemed to keep him on their level. His\r\nstrength lay less in the form and vesture of the thought than in the\r\nthought itself, in the large, simple, practical view which he took of\r\nthe position. And thus, to repeat what has been said already, the\r\nsterling merit of these speeches of his, that which made them effective\r\nwhen they were delivered and makes them worth reading to-day, is to be\r\nfound in the justness of his conclusions and their fitness to the\r\ncircumstances of the time. When he rose into higher air, when his words\r\nwere clothed with stateliness and solemnity, it was the force of his\r\nconviction and the emotion that thrilled through his utterance, that\r\nprinted the words deep upon the minds and drove them home to the hearts\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nWhat is a great man? Common speech, which after all must be our guide to\r\nthe sense of the terms which the world uses, gives this name to many\r\nsorts of men. How far greatness lies in the power and range of the\r\nintellect, how far in the strength of the will, how far in elevation of\r\nview and aim and purpose,--this is a question too large to be debated\r\nhere. But of Abraham Lincoln it may be truly said that in his greatness\r\nall three elements were present. He had not the brilliance, either in\r\nthought or word or act, that dazzles, nor the restless activity that\r\noccasionally pushes to the front even persons with gifts not of the\r\nfirst order. He was a patient, thoughtful, melancholy man, whose\r\nintelligence, working sometimes slowly but always steadily and surely,\r\nwas capacious enough to embrace and vigorous enough to master the\r\nincomparably difficult facts and problems he was called to deal with.\r\nHis executive talent showed itself not in sudden and startling strokes,\r\nbut in the calm serenity with which he formed his judgments and laid his\r\nplans, in the undismayed firmness with which he adhered to them in the\r\nface of popular clamour, of conflicting counsels from his advisers,\r\nsometimes, even, of what others deemed all but hopeless failure. These\r\nwere the qualities needed in one who had to pilot the Republic through\r\nthe heaviest storm that had ever broken upon it. But the mainspring of\r\nhis power, and the truest evidence of his greatness, lay in the nobility\r\nof his aims, in the fervour of his conviction, in the stainless\r\nrectitude which guided his action and won for him the confidence of the\r\npeople. Without these things neither the vigour of his intellect nor the\r\nfirmness of his will would have availed.\r\n\r\nThere is a vulgar saying that all great men are unscrupulous. Of him it\r\nmay rather be said that the note of greatness we feel in his thinking\r\nand his speech and his conduct had its source in the loftiness and\r\npurity of his character. Lincoln\'s is one of the careers that refute\r\nthis imputation on human nature.\r\n\r\nJAMES BRYCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of Lincoln\'s published works:\r\n\r\nSELECTIONS.--Letters on Questions of National Policy, etc., 1863;\r\nDedicatory Speech of President Lincoln, etc., at the Consecration of\r\nGettysburg Cemetery, Nov. 19th, 1863, 1864; The Last Address of\r\nPresident Lincoln to the American People, 1865; The Martyr\'s Monument,\r\n1865; In Memoriam, 1865; Gems from A.

From an Address to the People of\r\nSangamon County. March 9, 1832_\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the subject of education, not presuming to dictate any plan or\r\nsystem respecting it, I can only say that I view it as the most\r\nimportant subject which we, as a people, can be engaged in. That every\r\nman may receive at least a moderate education, and thereby be enabled to\r\nread the histories of his own and other countries, by which he may duly\r\nappreciate the value of our free institutions, appears to be an object\r\nof vital importance, even on this account alone, to say nothing of the\r\nadvantages and satisfaction to be derived from all being able to read\r\nthe Scriptures and other works, both of a religious and moral nature,\r\nfor themselves.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I desire to see the time when education--and by its means\r\nmorality, sobriety, enterprise, and industry--shall become much more\r\ngeneral than at present; and should be gratified to have it in my power\r\nto contribute something to the advancement of any measure which might\r\nhave a tendency to accelerate that happy period.\r\n\r\nWith regard to existing laws, some alterations are thought to be\r\nnecessary. Many respectable men have suggested that our estray laws--the\r\nlaw respecting the issuing of executions, the road law, and some\r\nothers--are deficient in their present form, and require alterations.\r\nBut considering the great probability that the framers of those laws\r\nwere wiser than myself, I should prefer not meddling with them, unless\r\nthey were first attacked by others, in which case I should feel it both\r\na privilege and a duty to take that stand which, in my view, might tend\r\nto the advancement of justice.\r\n\r\nBut, fellow-citizens, I shall conclude. Considering the great degree of\r\nmodesty which should always attend youth, it is probable I have already\r\nbeen more presuming than becomes me. However, upon the subjects of which\r\nI have treated, I have spoken as I have thought. I may be wrong in\r\nregard to any or all of them; but, holding it a sound maxim that it is\r\nbetter only to be sometimes right than at all times wrong, so soon as I\r\ndiscover my opinions to be erroneous I shall be ready to renounce them.\r\n\r\nEvery man is said to have his peculiar ambition. Whether it be true or\r\nnot, I can say, for one, that I have no other so great as that of being\r\ntruly esteemed of my fellow-men by rendering myself worthy of their\r\nesteem. How far I shall succeed in gratifying this ambition is yet to be\r\ndeveloped. I am young and unknown to many of you; I was born and have\r\never remained in the most humble walks of life. I have no wealthy or\r\npopular relations or friends to recommend me. My case is thrown\r\nexclusively upon the independent voters of the county, and if elected,\r\nthey will have conferred a favour upon me for which I shall be\r\nunremitting in my labours to compensate. But if the good people in their\r\nwisdom shall see fit to keep me in the background, I have been too\r\nfamiliar with disappointments to be very much chagrined.\r\n\r\n     Your friend and fellow-citizen,\r\n       A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter to Colonel Robert Allen. June 21, 1836_\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Colonel, I am told that during my absence last week you passed\r\nthrough this place, and stated publicly that you were in possession of a\r\nfact or facts which, if known to the public, would entirely destroy the\r\nprospects of N.W. Edwards and myself at the ensuing election; but that,\r\nthrough favour to us, you should forbear to divulge them. No one has\r\nneeded favours more than I, and, generally, few have been less unwilling\r\nto accept them; but in this case favour to me would be injustice to the\r\npublic, and therefore I must beg your pardon for declining it. That I\r\nonce had the confidence of the people of Sangamon, is sufficiently\r\nevident; and if I have since done anything, either by design or\r\nmisadventure, which if known would subject me to a forfeiture of that\r\nconfidence, he that knows of that thing, and conceals it, is a traitor\r\nto his country\'s interest.\r\n\r\nI find myself wholly unable to form any conjecture of what fact or\r\nfacts, real or supposed, you spoke; but my opinion of your veracity will\r\nnot permit me for a moment to doubt that you at least believed what you\r\nsaid. I am flattered with the personal regard you manifested for me; but\r\nI do hope that, on more mature reflection, you will view the public\r\ninterest as a paramount consideration, and therefore determine to let\r\nthe worst come. I here assure you that the candid statement of facts on\r\nyour part, however low it may sink me, shall never break the tie of\r\npersonal friendship between us. I wish an answer to this, and you are at\r\nliberty to publish both, if you choose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lincoln\'s Opinion on Universal Suffrage. From a Letter published in the\r\nSangamon "Journal." June 13, 1836_\r\n\r\n\r\nI go for all sharing the privileges of the government who assist in\r\nbearing its burdens: consequently I go for admitting all whites to the\r\nright of suffrage who pay taxes or bear arms [by no means excluding\r\nfemales].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From an Address before the Young Men\'s Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois.\r\nJanuary 27, 1837_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a subject for the remarks of the evening "The perpetuation of our\r\npolitical institutions" is selected. In the great journal of things\r\nhappening under the sun, we, the American people, find our account\r\nrunning under the date of the nineteenth century of the Christian era.\r\nWe find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion of\r\nthe earth, as regards extent of territory, fertility of soil, and\r\nsalubrity of climate. We find ourselves under the government of a system\r\nof political institutions conducing more essentially to the ends of\r\ncivil and religious liberty, than any of which the history of former\r\ntimes tells us. We, when remounting the stage of existence, found\r\nourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings. We toiled\r\nnot in the acquirement or the establishment of them; they are a legacy\r\nbequeathed to us by a once hardy, brave, and patriotic, but now lamented\r\nand departed race of ancestors.\r\n\r\nTheirs was the task (and nobly they performed it) to possess themselves,\r\nand through themselves us, of this goodly land, and to rear upon its\r\nhills and valleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights; \'tis\r\nours only to transmit these,--the former unprofaned by the foot of the\r\ninvader; the latter undecayed by lapse of time. This, our duty to\r\nourselves and to our posterity, and love for our species in general,\r\nimperatively require us to perform.\r\n\r\nHow, then, shall we perform it? At what point shall we expect the\r\napproach of danger? By what means shall we fortify against it? Shall we\r\nexpect some transatlantic military giant to step across the ocean and\r\ncrush us at a blow? Never. All the armies of Europe, Asia and Africa\r\ncombined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their\r\nmilitary chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not, by force,\r\ntake a drink from the Ohio, or make a track on the Blue Ridge, in a\r\ntrial of a thousand years.\r\n\r\nAt what point, then, is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer,\r\nif it ever reaches us, it must spring up among us. It cannot come from\r\nabroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and\r\nfinisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die\r\nby suicide.\r\n\r\nThere is even now something of ill omen among us. I mean the increasing\r\ndisregard for law which pervades the country; the growing disposition to\r\nsubstitute wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of\r\ncourts; and the worse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of\r\njustice. This disposition is awfully fearful in any community; and that\r\nit now exists in ours, though grating to our feelings to admit, it would\r\nbe a violation of truth and an insult to our intelligence to deny.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI know the American people are _much_ attached to their government. I\r\nknow they would suffer _much_ for its sake. I know they would endure\r\nevils long and patiently before they would ever think of exchanging it\r\nfor another. Yet, notwithstanding all this, if the laws be continually\r\ndespised and disregarded, if their rights to be secure in their persons\r\nand property are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob, the\r\nalienation of their affection for the government is the natural\r\nconsequence, and to that sooner or later it must come.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is one point at which danger may be expected. The question\r\nrecurs, how shall we fortify against it? The answer is simple. Let every\r\nAmerican, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher to his posterity,\r\nswear by the blood of the Revolution never to violate in the least\r\nparticular the laws of the country, and never to tolerate their\r\nviolation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support\r\nof the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the\r\nConstitution and the Laws let every American pledge his life, his\r\nproperty, and his sacred honour; let every man remember that to violate\r\nthe law is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the\r\ncharter of his own and his children\'s liberty. Let reverence for the\r\nlaws be breathed by every American mother to the lisping babe that\r\nprattles on her lap. Let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in\r\ncolleges. Let it be written in primers, spelling-books, and in almanacs.\r\nLet it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and\r\nenforced in courts of justice. And, in short, let it become the\r\npolitical religion of the nation.\r\n\r\nWhen I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws, let me\r\nnot be understood as saying that there are no bad laws, or that\r\ngrievances may not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions\r\nhave been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do mean to say that\r\nalthough bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as\r\npossible, still, while they continue in force, for the sake of example\r\nthey should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided cases. If\r\nsuch arise, let proper legal provisions be made for them with the least\r\npossible delay, but till then let them, if not too intolerable, be borne\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThere is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law. In any\r\ncase that may arise, as, for instance, the promulgation of abolitionism,\r\none of two positions is necessarily true--that is, the thing is right\r\nwithin itself, and therefore deserves the protection of all law and all\r\ngood citizens, or it is wrong, and therefore proper to be prohibited by\r\nlegal enactments; and in neither case is the interposition of mob law\r\neither necessary, justifiable, or excusable....\r\n\r\nThey (histories of the Revolution) were pillars of the temple of\r\nliberty; and now that they have crumbled away, that temple must fall\r\nunless we, their descendants, supply their places with other pillars,\r\nhewn from the solid quarry of sober reason. Passion has helped us, but\r\ncan do so no more. It will in future be our enemy. Reason--cold,\r\ncalculating, unimpassioned reason--must furnish all the materials for\r\nour future support and defence. Let those materials be moulded into\r\ngeneral intelligence, sound morality, and, in particular, a reverence\r\nfor the Constitution and laws; and that we improved to the last, that we\r\nremained free to the last, that we revered his name to the last, that\r\nduring his long sleep we permitted no hostile foot to pass over or\r\ndesecrate his resting-place, shall be that which to learn the last trump\r\nshall awaken our Washington.\r\n\r\nUpon these let the proud fabric of freedom rest, as the rock of its\r\nbasis; and as truly as has been said of the only greater institution,\r\n"the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."\r\n\r\nMany great and good men, sufficiently qualified for any task they should\r\nundertake, may ever be found, whose ambition would aspire to nothing\r\nbeyond a seat in Congress, a gubernatorial or a presidential chair. But\r\nsuch belong not to the family of the lion or the brood of the eagle.\r\nWhat? Think you these places would satisfy an Alexander, a C\xc3\xa6sar, or a\r\nNapoleon? Never! Towering genius disdains a beaten path. It seeks\r\nregions hitherto unexplored. It sees no distinction in adding story to\r\nstory upon the monuments of fame erected to the memory of others. It\r\ndenies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief. It scorns to\r\ntread in the footsteps of any predecessor, however illustrious. It\r\nthirsts and burns for distinction; and, if possible, it will have it,\r\nwhether at the expense of emancipating slaves, or enslaving free men. Is\r\nit unreasonable, then, to expect that some men, possessed of the\r\nloftiest genius, coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its\r\nutmost stretch, will at some time spring up among us? And when such a\r\none does, it will require the people to be united with each other,\r\nattached to the government and laws, and generally intelligent, to\r\nsuccessfully frustrate his design.\r\n\r\nDistinction will be his paramount object, and although he would as\r\nwillingly, perhaps more so, acquire it by doing good as harm, yet that\r\nopportunity being passed, and nothing left to be done in the way of\r\nbuilding up, he would sit down boldly to the task of pulling down. Here,\r\nthen, is a probable case, highly dangerous, and such a one as could not\r\nwell have existed heretofore.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll honour to our Revolutionary ancestors, to whom we are indebted for\r\nthese institutions. They will not be forgotten. In history we hope they\r\nwill be read of, and recounted, so long as the Bible shall be read. But\r\neven granting that they will, their influence cannot be what it\r\nheretofore has been. Even then, they cannot be so universally known, nor\r\nso vividly felt, as they were by the generation just gone to rest. At\r\nthe close of that struggle, nearly every adult male had been a\r\nparticipator in some of its scenes. The consequence was, that of those\r\nscenes, in the form of a husband, a father, a son, or a brother, a\r\nliving history was to be found in every family,--a history bearing the\r\nindubitable testimonies to its own authenticity in the limbs mangled, in\r\nthe scars of wounds received in the midst of the very scenes related; a\r\nhistory, too, that could be read and understood alike by all, the wise\r\nand the ignorant, the learned and the unlearned. But those histories are\r\ngone. They can be read no more for ever. They were a fortress of\r\nstrength; but what the invading foemen could never do, the silent\r\nartillery of time has done,--the levelling of its walls. They are gone.\r\nThey were a forest of giant oaks; but the resistless hurricane has swept\r\nover them, and left only here and there a lonely trunk, despoiled of its\r\nverdure, shorn of its foliage, unshading and unshaded, to murmur in a\r\nfew more gentle breezes, and to combat with its mutilated limbs a few\r\nmore ruder storms, and then to sink and be no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMOROUS ACCOUNT OF HIS EXPERIENCES WITH A LADY HE WAS REQUESTED TO\r\nMARRY\r\n\r\n_A Letter to Mrs. O.H. Browning. Springfield, Illinois. April 1, 1838_\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Madam, Without apologising for being egotistical, I shall make the\r\nhistory of so much of my life as has elapsed since I saw you the subject\r\nof this letter. And, by the way, I now discover that in order to give a\r\nfull and intelligible account of the things I have done and suffered\r\nsince I saw you, I shall necessarily have to relate some that happened\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nIt was, then, in the autumn of 1836 that a married lady of my\r\nacquaintance, and who was a great friend of mine, being about to pay a\r\nvisit to her father and other relatives residing in Kentucky, proposed\r\nto me that on her return she would bring a sister of hers with her on\r\ncondition that I would engage to become her brother-in-law with all\r\nconvenient dispatch. I, of course, accepted the proposal, for you know I\r\ncould not have done otherwise had I really been averse to it; but\r\nprivately, between you and me, I was most confoundedly well pleased with\r\nthe project. I had seen the said sister some three years before, thought\r\nher intelligent and agreeable, and saw no good objection to plodding\r\nlife through hand-in-hand with her. Time passed on, the lady took her\r\njourney, and in due time returned, sister in company, sure enough. This\r\nastonished me a little, for it appeared to me that her coming so readily\r\nshowed that she was a trifle too willing, but on reflection it occurred\r\nto me that she might have been prevailed on by her married sister to\r\ncome, without anything concerning me having been mentioned to her, and\r\nso I concluded that if no other objection presented itself, I would\r\nconsent to waive this. All this occurred to me on hearing of her arrival\r\nin the neighbourhood--for, be it remembered, I had not yet seen her,\r\nexcept about three years previous, as above mentioned. In a few days we\r\nhad an interview, and, although I had seen her before, she did not look\r\nas my imagination had pictured her. I knew she was over-size, but she\r\nnow appeared a fair match for Falstaff. I knew she was called an "old\r\nmaid," and I felt no doubt of the truth of at least half of the\r\nappellation, but now, when I beheld her, I could not for my life avoid\r\nthinking of my mother; and this, not from withered features,--for her\r\nskin was too full of fat to permit of its contracting into wrinkles--but\r\nfrom her want of teeth, weather-beaten appearance in general, and from a\r\nkind of notion that ran in my head that nothing could have commenced at\r\nthe size of infancy and reached her present bulk in less than\r\nthirty-five or forty years; and, in short, I was not at all pleased with\r\nher. But what could I do? I had told her sister that I would take her\r\nfor better or for worse, and I made a point of honour and conscience in\r\nall things to stick to my word, especially if others had been induced to\r\nact on it, which in this case I had no doubt they had, for I was now\r\nfairly convinced that no other man on earth would have her, and hence\r\nthe conclusion that they were bent on holding me to my bargain. "Well,"\r\nthought I, "I have said it, and, be the consequences what they may, it\r\nshall not be my fault if I fail to do it." At once I determined to\r\nconsider her my wife, and this done, all my powers of discovery were put\r\nto work in search of perfections in her which might be fairly set off\r\nagainst her defects. I tried to imagine her handsome, which, but for her\r\nunfortunate corpulency, was actually true. Exclusive of this, no woman\r\nthat I have ever seen has a finer face. I also tried to convince myself\r\nthat the mind was much more to be valued than the person, and in this\r\nshe was not inferior, as I could discover, to any with whom I had been\r\nacquainted.\r\n\r\nShortly after this, without attempting to come to any positive\r\nunderstanding with her, I set out for Vandalia, when and where you first\r\nsaw me. During my stay there I had letters from her which did not change\r\nmy opinion of either her intellect or intention, but, on the contrary,\r\nconfirmed it in both.\r\n\r\nAll this while, although I was fixed "firm as the surge-repelling rock"\r\nin my resolution, I found I was continually repenting the rashness which\r\nhad led me to make it. Through life I have been in no bondage, either\r\nreal or imaginary, from the thraldom of which I so much desired to be\r\nfree. After my return home I saw nothing to change my opinion of her in\r\nany particular. She was the same, and so was I. I now spent my time in\r\nplanning how I might get along in life after my contemplated change of\r\ncircumstances should have taken place, and how I might procrastinate the\r\nevil day for a time, which I really dreaded as much, perhaps more, than\r\nan Irishman does the halter.\r\n\r\nAfter all my sufferings upon this deeply interesting subject, here I\r\nam, wholly, unexpectedly, completely out of the "scrape," and I now want\r\nto know if you can guess how I got out of it--out, clear, in every sense\r\nof the term--no violation of word, honour, or conscience. I don\'t\r\nbelieve you can guess, and so I might as well tell you at once. As the\r\nlawyer says, it was done in the manner following, to wit: After I had\r\ndelayed the matter as long as I thought I could in honour do (which, by\r\nthe way, had brought me round into the last fall), I concluded I might\r\nas well bring it to a consummation without further delay, and so I\r\nmustered my resolution and made the proposal to her direct; but,\r\nshocking to relate, she answered, No. At first I supposed she did it\r\nthrough an affectation of modesty, which I thought but ill became her\r\nunder the peculiar circumstances of the case, but on my renewal of the\r\ncharge I found she repelled it with greater firmness than before. I\r\ntried it again and again, but with the same success, or rather with the\r\nsame want of success.\r\n\r\nI finally was forced to give it up, at which I very unexpectedly found\r\nmyself mortified almost beyond endurance. I was mortified, it seemed to\r\nme, in a hundred different ways. My vanity was deeply wounded by the\r\nreflection that I had so long been too stupid to discover her\r\nintentions, and at the same time never doubting that I understood them\r\nperfectly; and also that she, whom I had taught myself to believe nobody\r\nelse would have, had actually rejected me with all my fancied greatness.\r\nAnd, to cap the whole, I then for the first time began to suspect that I\r\nwas really a little in love with her. But let it all go! I\'ll try and\r\noutlive it. Others have been made fools of by the girls, but this can\r\nnever in truth be said of me. I most emphatically, in this instance,\r\nmade a fool of myself. I have now come to the conclusion never again to\r\nthink of marrying, and for this reason--I can never be satisfied with\r\nany one who would be blockhead enough to have me.\r\n\r\nWhen you receive this, write me a long yarn about something to amuse me.\r\nGive my respects to Mr. Browning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From a Debate between Lincoln, E.D. Baker, and others against Douglas,\r\nLamborn, and others. Springfield. December 1839_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n... Mr. Lamborn insists that the difference between the Van Buren party\r\nand the Whigs is, that although the former sometimes err in practice,\r\nthey are always correct in principle, whereas the latter are wrong in\r\nprinciple; and the better to impress this proposition, he uses a\r\nfigurative expression in these words: "The Democrats are vulnerable in\r\nthe heel, but they are sound in the heart and in the head." The first\r\nbranch of the figure--that is, that the Democrats are vulnerable in the\r\nheel--I admit is not merely figuratively but literally true. Who that\r\nlooks but for a moment at their Swartwouts, their Prices, their\r\nHarringtons, and their hundreds of others, scampering away with the\r\npublic money to Texas, to Europe, and to every spot of the earth where a\r\nvillain may hope to find refuge from justice, can at all doubt that they\r\nare most distressingly affected in their heels with a species of running\r\nfever? It seems that this malady of their heels operates on the\r\nsound-headed and honest-hearted creatures very much like the cork leg in\r\nthe song did on its owner, which, when he had once got started on it,\r\nthe more he tried to stop it, the more it would run away. At the hazard\r\nof wearing this point threadbare, I will relate an anecdote which seems\r\nto be too strikingly in point to be omitted. A witty Irish soldier who\r\nwas always boasting of his bravery when no danger was near, but who\r\ninvariably retreated without orders at the first charge of the\r\nengagement, being asked by his captain why he did so, replied, "Captain,\r\nI have as brave a heart as Julius C\xc3\xa6sar ever had; but somehow or other,\r\nwhenever danger approaches, my cowardly legs will run away with it." So\r\nit is with Mr. Lamborn\'s party. They take the public money into their\r\nhands for the most laudable purpose that wise heads and honest hearts\r\ncan dictate, but before they can possibly get it out again, their\r\nrascally vulnerable heels will run away with them....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter to W.G. Anderson. Lawrenceville, Illinois. October 31, 1840_\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Sir, Your note of yesterday is received. In the difficulty between\r\nus of which you speak, you say you think I was the aggressor. I do not\r\nthink I was. You say my "words imported insult." I meant them as a fair\r\nset-off to your own statements, and not otherwise; and in that light\r\nalone I now wish you to understand them. You ask for my present\r\n"feelings on the subject." I entertain no unkind feelings to you, and\r\nnone of any sort upon the subject, except a sincere regret that I\r\npermitted myself to get into such an altercation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from a Letter to John T. Stuart. Springfield Illinois. January\r\n23, 1841_\r\n\r\n\r\nFor not giving you a general summary of news, you must pardon me; it is\r\nnot in my power to do so. I am now the most miserable man living. If\r\nwhat I feel were equally distributed to the whole human family, there\r\nwould not be one cheerful face on earth. Whether I shall ever be better,\r\nI cannot tell; I awfully forebode I shall not. To remain as I am is\r\nimpossible; I must die or be better, it appears to me. The matter you\r\nspeak of on my account you may attend to as you say, unless you shall\r\nhear of my condition forbidding it. I say this because I fear I shall be\r\nunable to attend to any business here, and a change of scene might help\r\nme. If I could be myself, I would rather remain at home with Judge\r\nLogan. I can write no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From an Address before the Washingtonian Temperance Society.\r\nSpringfield, Illinois. February 22, 1842_\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the temperance cause has been in progress for nearly twenty\r\nyears, it is apparent to all that it is just now being crowned with a\r\ndegree of success hitherto unparalleled.\r\n\r\nThe list of its friends is daily swelled by the additions of fifties, of\r\nhundreds, and of thousands. The cause itself seems suddenly transformed\r\nfrom a cold abstract theory to a living, breathing, active and powerful\r\nchieftain, going forth conquering and to conquer. The citadels of his\r\ngreat adversary are daily being stormed and dismantled; his temples and\r\nhis altars, where the rites of his idolatrous worship have long been\r\nperformed, and where human sacrifices have long been wont to be made,\r\nare daily desecrated and deserted. The trump of the conqueror\'s fame is\r\nsounding from hill to hill, from sea to sea, and from land to land, and\r\ncalling millions to his standard at a blast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"But," say some, "we are no drunkards, and we shall not acknowledge\r\nourselves such by joining a reform drunkard\'s society, whatever our\r\ninfluence might be." Surely no Christian will adhere to this objection.\r\n\r\nIf they believe, as they profess, that Omnipotence condescended to take\r\non himself the form of sinful man, and, as such, to die an ignominious\r\ndeath for their sakes, surely they will not refuse submission to the\r\ninfinitely lesser condescension for the temporal and perhaps eternal\r\nsalvation of a large, erring, and unfortunate class of their\r\nfellow-creatures; nor is the condescension very great. In my judgment,\r\nsuch of us as have never fallen victims have been spared more from the\r\nabsence of appetite, than from any mental or moral superiority over\r\nthose who have. Indeed I believe, if we take habitual drunkards as a\r\nclass, their heads and their hearts will bear an advantageous comparison\r\nwith those of any other class. There seems ever to have been a proneness\r\nin the brilliant and warm-blooded to fall into this vice. The demon of\r\nintemperance ever seems to have delighted in sucking the blood of genius\r\nand generosity. What one of us but can call to mind some relative more\r\npromising in youth than all his fellows, who has fallen a sacrifice to\r\nhis rapacity? He ever seems to have gone forth like the Egyptian angel\r\nof death, commissioned to slay, if not the first, the fairest born of\r\nevery family. Shall he now be arrested in his desolating career? In that\r\narrest all can give aid that will; and who shall be excused that can and\r\nwill not? Far around as human breath has ever blown, he keeps our\r\nfathers, our brothers, our sons, and our friends prostrate in the chains\r\nof moral death....\r\n\r\nWhen the conduct of men is designed to be influenced, persuasion, kind,\r\nunassuming persuasion, should ever be adopted. It is an old and a true\r\nmaxim "that a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall."\r\nSo with men. If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him\r\nthat you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches\r\nhis heart, which, say what you will, is the great high-road to his\r\nreason, and which, when once gained, you will find but little trouble in\r\nconvincing his judgment of the justice of your cause, if indeed that\r\ncause really be a just one. On the contrary, assume to dictate to his\r\njudgment, or to command his action, or to mark him as one to be shunned\r\nand despised, and he will retreat within himself, close all the avenues\r\nto his head and his heart; and though your cause be naked truth itself,\r\ntransformed to the heaviest lance, harder than steel, and sharper than\r\nsteel can be made, and though you throw it with more than herculean\r\nforce and precision, you shall be no more able to pierce him than to\r\npenetrate the hard shell of a tortoise with a rye straw. Such is man,\r\nand so must he be understood by those who would lead him, even to his\r\nown best interests....\r\n\r\nAnother error, as it seems to me, into which the old reformers fell, was\r\nthe position that all habitual drunkards were utterly incorrigible, and\r\ntherefore must be turned adrift and damned without remedy in order that\r\nthe grace of temperance might abound, to the temperate then, and to all\r\nmankind some hundreds of years thereafter. There is in this something so\r\nrepugnant to humanity, so uncharitable, so cold-blooded and feelingless,\r\nthat it never did, nor never can enlist the enthusiasm of a popular\r\ncause. We could not love the man who taught it--we could not hear him\r\nwith patience. The heart could not throw open its portals to it, the\r\ngenerous man could not adopt it--it could not mix with his blood. It\r\nlooked so fiendishly selfish, so like throwing fathers and brothers\r\noverboard to lighten the boat for our security, that the noble-minded\r\nshrank from the manifest meanness of the thing. And besides this, the\r\nbenefits of a reformation to be effected by such a system were too\r\nremote in point of time to warmly engage many in its behalf. Few can be\r\ninduced to labour exclusively for posterity; and none will do it\r\nenthusiastically. Posterity has done nothing for us; and theorize on it\r\nas we may, practically we shall do very little for it, unless we are\r\nmade to think we are at the same time doing something for ourselves.\r\n\r\nWhat an ignorance of human nature does it exhibit, to ask or expect a\r\nwhole community to rise up and labour for the temporal happiness of\r\nothers, after themselves shall be consigned to the dust, a majority of\r\nwhich community take no pains whatever to secure their own eternal\r\nwelfare at no more distant day! Great distance in either time or space\r\nhas wonderful power to lull and render quiescent the human mind.\r\nPleasures to be enjoyed, or pains to be endured, after we shall be dead\r\nand gone, are but little regarded even in our own cases, and much less\r\nin the cases of others. Still, in addition to this there is something so\r\nludicrous in promises of good or threats of evil a great way off as to\r\nrender the whole subject with which they are connected easily turned\r\ninto ridicule. "Better lay down that spade you are stealing, Paddy; if\r\nyou don\'t you\'ll pay for it at the day of judgment." "Be the powers, if\r\nye\'ll credit me so long I\'ll take another jist."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the Circular of the Whig Committee. An Address to the People of\r\nIllinois. March 4, 1843_\r\n\r\n\r\n... The system of loans is but temporary in its nature, and must soon\r\nexplode. It is a system not only ruinous while it lasts, but one that\r\nmust soon fail and leave us destitute.\r\n\r\nAs an individual who undertakes to live by borrowing soon finds his\r\noriginal means devoured by interest, and next, no one left to borrow\r\nfrom, so must it be with a government.\r\n\r\nWe repeat, then, that a tariff sufficient for revenue, or a direct tax,\r\nmust soon be resorted to; and, indeed, we believe this alternative is\r\nnow denied by no one. But which system shall be adopted? Some of our\r\nopponents in theory admit the propriety of a tariff sufficient for\r\nrevenue, but even they will not in practice vote for such a tariff;\r\nwhile others boldly advocate direct taxation. Inasmuch, therefore, as\r\nsome of them boldly advocate direct taxation, and all the rest--or so\r\nnearly all as to make exceptions needless--refuse to adopt the tariff,\r\nwe think it is doing them no injustice to class them all as advocates of\r\ndirect taxation. Indeed, we believe they are only delaying an open\r\navowal of the system till they can assure themselves that the people\r\nwill tolerate it. Let us, then, briefly compare the two systems. The\r\ntariff is the cheaper system, because the duties, being collected in\r\nlarge parcels, at a few commercial points, will require comparatively\r\nfew officers in their collection; while by the direct tax system the\r\nland must be literally covered with assessors and collectors, going\r\nforth like swarms of Egyptian locusts, devouring every blade of grass\r\nand other green thing. And, again, by the tariff system the whole\r\nrevenue is paid by the consumers of foreign goods, and those chiefly the\r\nluxuries and not the necessaries of life. By this system, the man who\r\ncontents himself to live upon the products of his own country pays\r\nnothing at all. And surely that country is extensive enough, and its\r\nproducts abundant and varied enough, to answer all the real wants of its\r\npeople. In short, by this system the burden of revenue falls almost\r\nentirely on the wealthy and luxurious few, while the substantial and\r\nlabouring many, who live at home and upon home products, go entirely\r\nfree. By the direct tax system, none can escape. However strictly the\r\ncitizen may exclude from his premises all foreign luxuries, fine cloths,\r\nfine silks, rich wines, golden chains, and diamond rings,--still, for\r\nthe possession of his house, his barn, and his homespun he is to be\r\nperpetually haunted and harassed by the tax-gatherer. With these views,\r\nwe leave it to be determined whether we or our opponents are more truly\r\ndemocratic on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From a Letter to Martin M. Morris. Springfield, Illinois. March 26,\r\n1843_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is truly gratifying to me to learn that while the people of Sangamon\r\nhave cast me off, my old friends of Menard, who have known me longest\r\nand best, stick to me. It would astonish, if not amuse, the older\r\ncitizens to learn that I (a stranger, friendless, uneducated, penniless\r\nboy, working on a flatboat at ten dollars per month) have been put down\r\nhere as the candidate of pride, wealth, and aristocratic family\r\ndistinction. Yet so, chiefly, it was. There was, too, the strangest\r\ncombination of church influence against me. Baker is a Campbellite; and\r\ntherefore, as I suppose, with few exceptions, got all that church. My\r\nwife has some relations in the Presbyterian churches, and some with the\r\nEpiscopal churches; and therefore, wherever it would tell, I was set\r\ndown as either the one or the other, while it was everywhere contended\r\nthat no Christian ought to go for me, because I belonged to no church,\r\nwas suspected of being a deist, and had talked about fighting a duel.\r\nWith all these things, Baker, of course, had nothing to do. Nor do I\r\ncomplain of them. As to his own church going for him, I think that was\r\nright enough, and as to the influences I have spoken of in the other,\r\nthough they were very strong, it would be grossly untrue and unjust to\r\ncharge that they acted upon them in a body, or were very near so. I only\r\nmean that those influences levied a tax of a considerable per cent. upon\r\nmy strength throughout the religious controversy. But enough of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From a Letter to Joshua F. Speed. Springfield. October 22, 1846_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have another boy, born the 10th of March. He is very much such a\r\nchild as Bob was at his age, rather of a longer order. Bob is "short and\r\nlow," and I expect always will be. He talks very plainly--almost as\r\nplainly as anybody. He is quite smart enough. I sometimes fear that he\r\nis one of the little rare-ripe sort that are smarter at about five than\r\never after. He has a great deal of that sort of mischief that is the\r\noffspring of such animal spirits. Since I began this letter, a messenger\r\ncame to tell me Bob was lost; but by the time I reached the house his\r\nmother had found him and had him whipped, and by now, very likely, he is\r\nrun away again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From a Letter to William H. Herndon. Washington. January 8, 1848_\r\n\r\n\r\nDear William, Your letter of December 27th was received a day or two\r\nago. I am much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken, and\r\npromise to take in my little business there. As to speech-making, by way\r\nof getting the hang of the House, I made a little speech two or three\r\ndays ago on a post-office question of no general interest. I find\r\nspeaking here and elsewhere about the same thing. I was about as badly\r\nscared, and no worse, as I am when I speak in court. I expect to make\r\none within a week or two, in which I hope to succeed well enough to wish\r\nyou to see it.\r\n\r\nIt is very pleasant to learn from you that there are some who desire\r\nthat I should be re-elected. I most heartily thank them for their\r\npartiality; and I can say, as Mr. Clay said of the annexation of Texas,\r\nthat "personally I would not object" to a re-election, although I\r\nthought at the time, and still think, it would be quite as well for me\r\nto return to the law at the end of a single term. I made the declaration\r\nthat I would not be a candidate again, more from a wish to deal fairly\r\nwith others, to keep peace among our friends, and to keep the district\r\nfrom going to the enemy, than for any cause personal to myself; so that,\r\nif it should so happen that nobody else wishes to be elected, I could\r\nrefuse the people the right of sending me again. But to enter myself as\r\na competitor of others, or to authorize any one so to enter me, is what\r\nmy word and honour forbid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From a Letter to William H. Herndon. Washington. June 22, 1848_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the young men. You must not wait to be brought forward by the\r\nolder men. For instance, do you suppose that I should ever have got into\r\nnotice if I had waited to be hunted up and pushed forward by older men?\r\nYou young men get together and form a "Rough and Ready Club," and have\r\nregular meetings and speeches. Take in everybody you can get. Harrison\r\nGrimsley, L.A. Enos, Lee Kimball and C.W. Matheny will do to begin the\r\nthing; but as you go along gather up all the shrewd, wild boys about\r\ntown, whether just of age or a little under age--Chris. Logan, Reddick\r\nRidgley, Lewis Zwizler, and hundreds such. Let every one play the part\r\nhe can play best,--some speak, some sing, and all "holler." Your\r\nmeetings will be of evenings; the older men, and the women, will go to\r\nhear you; so that it will not only contribute to the election of "Old\r\nZach," but will be an interesting pastime, and improving to the\r\nintellectual faculties of all engaged. Don\'t fail to do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From a Letter to William H. Herndon. Washington, July 10, 1848_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way for a young man to rise is to improve himself every way he can,\r\nnever suspecting that anybody wishes to hinder him. Allow me to assure\r\nyou that suspicion and jealousy never did help any man in any situation.\r\nThere may sometimes be ungenerous attempts to keep a young man down; and\r\nthey will succeed, too, if he allows his mind to be diverted from its\r\ntrue channel to brood over the attempted injury. Cast about, and see if\r\nthis feeling has not injured every person you have ever known to fall\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter to John D. Johnston. January 2, 1851_\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Johnston, Your request for eighty dollars I do not think it best to\r\ncomply with now. At the various times when I have helped you a little\r\nyou have said to me, "We can get along very well now"; but in a very\r\nshort time I find you in the same difficulty again. Now, this can only\r\nhappen by some defect in your conduct. What that defect is, I think I\r\nknow. You are not lazy, and still you are an idler. I doubt whether,\r\nsince I saw you, you have done a good whole day\'s work in any one day.\r\nYou do not very much dislike to work, and still you do not work much,\r\nmerely because it does not seem to you that you could get much for it.\r\nThis habit of uselessly wasting time is the whole difficulty; it is\r\nvastly important to you, and still more so to your children, that you\r\nshould break the habit. It is more important to them, because they have\r\nlonger to live, and can keep out of an idle habit before they are in it,\r\neasier than they can get out after they are in.\r\n\r\nYou are now in need of some money; and what I propose is, that you shall\r\ngo to work, "tooth and nail," for somebody who will give you money for\r\nit. Let father and your boys take charge of your things at home,\r\nprepare for a crop, and make the crop, and you go to work for the best\r\nmoney wages, or in discharge of any debt you owe, that you can get; and,\r\nto secure you a fair reward for your labour, I now promise you, that for\r\nevery dollar you will, between this and the first of May, get for your\r\nown labour, either in money or as your own indebtedness, I will then\r\ngive you one other dollar. By this, if you hire yourself at ten dollars\r\na month, from me you will get ten more, making twenty dollars a month\r\nfor your work. In this I do not mean you shall go off to St. Louis, or\r\nthe lead mines, or the gold mines in California, but I mean for you to\r\ngo at it for the best wages you can get close to home in Coles County.\r\nNow, if you will do this, you will be soon out of debt, and, what is\r\nbetter, you will have a habit that will keep you from getting in debt\r\nagain. But, if I should now clear you out of debt, next year you would\r\nbe just as deep in as ever. You say you would almost give your place in\r\nheaven for seventy or eighty dollars. Then you value your place in\r\nheaven very cheap, for I am sure you can, with the offer I make, get the\r\nseventy or eighty dollars for four or five months\' work. You say if I\r\nwill furnish you the money you will deed me the land, and, if you don\'t\r\npay the money back, you will deliver possession. Nonsense! If you can\'t\r\nnow live with the land, how will you then live without it? You have\r\nalways been kind to me, and I do not mean to be unkind to you. On the\r\ncontrary, if you will but follow my advice, you will find it worth more\r\nthan eighty times eighty dollars to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter to John D. Johnston. Shelbyville. November 4, 1851_\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Brother, When I came into Charleston day before yesterday, I\r\nlearned that you are anxious to sell the land where you live and move to\r\nMissouri. I have been thinking of this ever since, and cannot but think\r\nsuch a notion is utterly foolish. What can you do in Missouri better\r\nthan here? Is the land any richer? Can you there, any more than here,\r\nraise corn and wheat and oats without work? Will anybody there, any more\r\nthan here, do your work for you? If you intend to go to work, there is\r\nno better place than right where you are; if you do not intend to go to\r\nwork, you cannot get along anywhere. Squirming and crawling about from\r\nplace to place can do no good. You have raised no crop this year; and\r\nwhat you really want is to sell the land, get the money, and spend it.\r\nPart with the land you have, and, my life upon it, you will never after\r\nown a spot big enough to bury you in. Half you will get for the land you\r\nwill spend in moving to Missouri, and the other half you will eat,\r\ndrink, and wear out, and no foot of land will be bought. Now, I feel it\r\nmy duty to have no hand in such a piece of foolery. I feel that it is so\r\neven on your own account, and particularly on mother\'s account. The\r\neastern forty acres I intend to keep for mother while she lives; if you\r\nwill not cultivate it, it will rent for enough to support her--at least,\r\nit will rent for something. Her dower in the other two forties she can\r\nlet you have, and no thanks to me. Now, do not misunderstand this\r\nletter; I do not write it in any unkindness. I write it in order, if\r\npossible, to get you to face the truth, which truth is, you are\r\ndestitute because you have idled away all your time. Your thousand\r\npretences for not getting along better are all nonsense; they deceive\r\nnobody but yourself. Go to work is the only cure for your case.\r\n\r\nA word to mother. Chapman tells me he wants you to go and live with him.\r\nIf I were you I would try it awhile. If you get tired of it (as I think\r\nyou will not), you can return to your own home. Chapman feels very\r\nkindly to you, and I have no doubt he will make your situation very\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note for Law Lecture. Written about July 1, 1850_\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not an accomplished lawyer. I find quite as much material for a\r\nlecture in those points wherein I have failed, as in those wherein I\r\nhave been moderately successful. The leading rule for a lawyer, as for\r\nthe man of every other calling, is diligence. Leave nothing for\r\nto-morrow which can be done to-day. Never let your correspondence fall\r\nbehind. Whatever piece of business you have in hand, before stopping, do\r\nall the labour pertaining to it which can then be done. When you bring a\r\ncommon law-suit, if you have the facts for doing so, write the\r\ndeclaration at once. If a law point be involved, examine the books, and\r\nnote the authority you rely on upon the declaration itself, where you\r\nare sure to find it when wanted. The same of defences and pleas. In\r\nbusiness not likely to be litigated,--ordinary collection cases,\r\nforeclosures, partitions, and the like,--make all examinations of\r\ntitles, and note them and even draft orders and decrees in advance. The\r\ncourse has a triple advantage; it avoids omissions and neglect, saves\r\nyour labour when once done, performs the labour out of court when you\r\nhave leisure, rather than in court when you have not.\r\n\r\nExtemporaneous speaking should be practised and cultivated. It is the\r\nlawyer\'s avenue to the public. However able and faithful he may be in\r\nother respects, people are slow to bring him business if he cannot make\r\na speech. And yet there is not a more fatal error to young lawyers than\r\nrelying too much on speech-making. If any one, upon his rare powers of\r\nspeaking, shall claim an exemption from the drudgery of the law, his\r\ncase is a failure in advance.\r\n\r\nDiscourage litigation. Persuade your neighbours to compromise whenever\r\nyou can. Point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real\r\nloser--in fees, expenses, and waste of time. As a peace-maker the lawyer\r\nhas a superior opportunity of being a good man. There will still be\r\nbusiness enough.\r\n\r\nNever stir up litigation. A worse man can scarcely be found than one who\r\ndoes this. Who can be more nearly a fiend than he who habitually\r\noverhauls the register of deeds in search of defects in titles, whereon\r\nto stir up strife, and put money in his pocket? A moral tone ought to be\r\ninfused into the profession which should drive such men out of it.\r\n\r\nThe matter of fees is important, far beyond the mere question of bread\r\nand butter involved. Properly attended to, fuller justice is done to\r\nboth lawyer and client. An exorbitant fee should never be claimed. As a\r\ngeneral rule, never take your whole fee in advance, nor any more than a\r\nsmall retainer. When fully paid beforehand, you are more than a common\r\nmortal if you can feel the same interest in the case as if something was\r\nstill in prospect for you, as well as for your client. And when you lack\r\ninterest in the case the job will very likely lack skill and diligence\r\nin the performance. Settle the amount of fee and take a note in advance.\r\nThen you will feel that you are working for something, and you are sure\r\nto do your work faithfully and well. Never sell a fee-note--at least not\r\nbefore the consideration service is performed. It leads to negligence\r\nand dishonesty--negligence by losing interest in the case, and\r\ndishonesty in refusing to refund when you have allowed the consideration\r\nto fail.\r\n\r\nThere is a vague popular belief that lawyers are necessarily dishonest.\r\nI say vague, because when we consider to what extent confidence and\r\nhonours are reposed in and conferred upon lawyers by the people, it\r\nappears improbable that their impression of dishonesty is very distinct\r\nand vivid. Yet the impression is common, almost universal. Let no young\r\nman choosing the law for a calling for a moment yield to the popular\r\nbelief. Resolve to be honest at all events; and if in your own judgment\r\nyou cannot be an honest lawyer, resolve to be honest without being a\r\nlawyer. Choose some other occupation, rather than one in the choosing of\r\nwhich you do, in advance, consent to be a knave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Fragment. Written about July 1, 1854_\r\n\r\nEquality in society alike beats inequality, whether the latter be of the\r\nBritish aristocratic sort or of the domestic slavery sort.\r\n\r\nWe know Southern men declare that their slaves are better off than hired\r\nlabourers amongst us. How little they know whereof they speak! There is\r\nno permanent class of hired labourers amongst us. Twenty-five years ago\r\nI was a hired labourer. The hired labourer of yesterday labours on his\r\nown account to-day, and will hire others to labour for him to-morrow.\r\n\r\nAdvancement--improvement in condition--is the order of things in a\r\nsociety of equals. As labour is the common burden of our race, so the\r\neffort of some to shift their share of the burden on to the shoulders of\r\nothers is the great durable curse of the race. Originally a curse for\r\ntransgression upon the whole race, when, as by slavery, it is\r\nconcentrated on a part only, it becomes the double-refined curse of God\r\nupon his creatures.\r\n\r\nFree labour has the inspiration of hope; pure slavery has no hope. The\r\npower of hope upon human exertion and happiness is wonderful. The\r\nslave-master himself has a conception of it, and hence the system of\r\ntasks among slaves. The slave whom you cannot drive with the lash to\r\nbreak seventy-five pounds of hemp in a day, if you will task him to\r\nbreak a hundred, and promise him pay for all he does over, he will break\r\nyou a hundred and fifty. You have substituted hope for the rod.\r\n\r\nAnd yet perhaps it does not occur to you that, to the extent of your\r\ngain in the case, you have given up the slave system and adopted the\r\nfree system of labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Fragment on Slavery. July 1854_\r\n\r\nIf A can prove, however conclusively, that he may of right enslave B,\r\nwhy may not B snatch the same argument and prove equally that he may\r\nenslave A? You say A is white and B is black. It is colour, then; the\r\nlighter having the right to enslave the darker? Take care. By this rule\r\nyou are to be slave to the first man you meet with a fairer skin than\r\nyour own.\r\n\r\nYou do not mean colour exactly? You mean the whites are intellectually\r\nthe superiors of the blacks, and therefore have the right to enslave\r\nthem? Take care again. By this rule you are to be slave to the first man\r\nyou meet with an intellect superior to your own.\r\n\r\nBut, say you, it is a question of interest, and if you make it your\r\ninterest you have the right to enslave another. Very well. And if he can\r\nmake it his interest he has the right to enslave you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lincoln\'s Reply to Senator Douglas at Peoria, Illinois. The Origin of\r\nthe Wilmot Proviso. October 16, 1854_\r\n\r\n\r\n... Our war with Mexico broke out in 1846. When Congress was about\r\nadjourning that session, President Polk asked them to place two millions\r\nof dollars under his control, to be used by him in the recess, if found\r\npracticable and expedient, in negotiating a treaty of peace with Mexico,\r\nand acquiring some part of her territory. A bill was duly gotten up for\r\nthe purpose, and was progressing swimmingly in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, when a Democratic member from Pennsylvania by the name\r\nof David Wilmot moved as an amendment, "Provided, that in any territory\r\nthus acquired there shall never be slavery." _This is the origin of the\r\nfar-famed Wilmot Proviso._ It created a great flutter; but it stuck like\r\nwax, was voted into the bill, and the bill passed with it through the\r\nHouse. The Senate, however, adjourned without final action on it, and so\r\nboth the appropriation and the proviso were lost for the time.\r\n\r\n... This declared indifference, but, as I must think, real, covert zeal,\r\nfor the spread of slavery, I cannot but hate. I hate it because of the\r\nmonstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our\r\nrepublican example of its just influence in the world, enables the\r\nenemies of free institutions with plausibility to taunt us as\r\nhypocrites, causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity,\r\nand especially because it forces so many good men amongst ourselves into\r\nan open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty,\r\ncriticizing the Declaration of Independence, and insisting that there is\r\nno right principle of action but self-interest.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding let me say that I think I have no prejudice against\r\nthe Southern people. They are just what we would be in their situation.\r\nIf slavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it. If\r\nit did now exist among us, we should not instantly give it up. This I\r\nbelieve of the masses North and South. Doubtless there are individuals\r\non both sides who would not hold slaves under any circumstances, and\r\nothers who would gladly introduce slavery anew if it were out of\r\nexistence. We know that some Southern men do free their slaves, go North\r\nand become tip-top Abolitionists, while some Northern ones go South and\r\nbecome most cruel slave-masters.\r\n\r\nWhen Southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin\r\nof slavery than we are, I acknowledge the fact. When it is said that the\r\ninstitution exists, and that it is very difficult to get rid of it in\r\nany satisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying. I\r\nsurely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to\r\ndo myself. If all earthly power were given me, I should not know what to\r\ndo as to the existing institution. My first impulse would be to free all\r\nthe slaves, and send them to Liberia, to their own native land. But a\r\nmoment\'s reflection would convince me that whatever of high hope (as I\r\nthink there is) there may be in this in the long run, its sudden\r\nexecution is impossible. If they were all landed there in a day, they\r\nwould all perish in the next ten days; and there are not surplus\r\nshipping and surplus money enough to carry them there in many times ten\r\ndays. What then? Free them all, and keep them among us as underlings? Is\r\nit quite certain that this betters their condition? I think I would not\r\nhold one in slavery at any rate, yet the point is not clear enough for\r\nme to denounce people upon. What next? Free them, and make them\r\npolitically and socially our equals? My own feelings will not admit of\r\nthis, and if mine would, we well know that those of the great mass of\r\nwhites will not. Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound\r\njudgment is not the sole question, if indeed it is any part of it. A\r\nuniversal feeling, whether well or ill founded, cannot be safely\r\ndisregarded. We cannot then make them equals. It does seem to me that\r\nsystems of gradual emancipation might be adopted, but for their\r\ntardiness in this I will not undertake to judge our brethren of the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nEqual justice to the South, it is said, requires us to consent to the\r\nextension of slavery to new countries. That is to say, that inasmuch as\r\nyou do not object to my taking my hog to Nebraska, therefore I must not\r\nobject to your taking your slave. Now, I admit that this is perfectly\r\nlogical, if there is no difference between hogs and slaves. But while\r\nyou thus require me to deny the humanity of the negro, I wish to ask\r\nwhether you of the South, yourselves, have ever been willing to do as\r\nmuch? It is kindly provided that of all those who come into the world,\r\nonly a small percentage are natural tyrants. That percentage is no\r\nlarger in the slave States than in the free. The great majority, South\r\nas well as North, have human sympathies, of which they can no more\r\ndivest themselves than they can of their sensibility to physical pain.\r\nThese sympathies in the bosoms of the Southern people manifest in many\r\nways their sense of the wrong of slavery, and their consciousness that,\r\nafter all, there is humanity in the negro. If they deny this let me\r\naddress them a few plain questions.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 you joined the North almost unanimously in declaring the African\r\nslave-trade piracy, and in annexing to it the punishment of death. Why\r\ndid you do this? If you did not feel that it was wrong, why did you join\r\nin providing that men should be hung for it? The practice was no more\r\nthan bringing wild negroes from Africa to such as would buy them. But\r\nyou never thought of hanging men for catching and selling wild horses,\r\nwild buffaloes, or wild bears.\r\n\r\nAgain, you have among you a sneaking individual of the class of native\r\ntyrants known as the _slave-dealer_. He watches your necessities, and\r\ncrawls up to buy your slave at a speculating price. If you cannot help\r\nit, you sell to him; but if you can help it, you drive him from your\r\ndoor. You despise him utterly; you do not recognize him as a friend, or\r\neven as an honest man. Your children must not play with his; they may\r\nrollick freely with the little negroes, but not with the slave-dealer\'s\r\nchildren. If you are obliged to deal with him, you try to get through\r\nthe job without so much as touching him. It is common with you to join\r\nhands with the men you meet; but with the slave-dealer you avoid the\r\nceremony,--instinctively shrinking from the snaky contact. If he grows\r\nrich and retires from business, you still remember him, and still keep\r\nup the ban of non-intercourse upon him and his family. Now, why is this?\r\nYou do not so treat the man who deals in cotton, corn, or tobacco.\r\n\r\nAnd yet again. There are in the United States and Territories, including\r\nthe District of Columbia, over four hundred and thirty thousand free\r\nblacks. At five hundred dollars per head, they are worth over two\r\nhundred millions of dollars. How comes this vast amount of property to\r\nbe running about without owners? We do not see free horses or free\r\ncattle running at large. How is this? All these free blacks are the\r\ndescendants of slaves, or have been slaves themselves; and they would be\r\nslaves now but for something that has operated on their white owners,\r\ninducing them at vast pecuniary sacrifice to liberate them. What is that\r\nsomething? Is there any mistaking it? In all these cases it is your\r\nsense of justice and human sympathy continually telling you that the\r\npoor negro has some natural right to himself,--that those who deny it\r\nand make mere merchandise of him deserve kickings, contempt, and death.\r\n\r\nAnd now why will you ask us to deny the humanity of the slave, and\r\nestimate him as only the equal of the hog? Why ask us to do what you\r\nwill not do yourselves? Why ask us to do for nothing what two hundred\r\nmillions of dollars could not induce you to do?\r\n\r\nBut one great argument in support of the repeal of the Missouri\r\nCompromise is still to come. That argument is "the sacred right of\r\nself-government." ... Some poet has said,--\r\n\r\n     "Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."\r\n\r\nAt the hazard of being thought one of the fools of this quotation, I\r\nmeet that argument,--I rush in,--I take that bull by the horns.... My\r\nfaith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases\r\nwith all which is exclusively his own, lies at the foundation of the\r\nsense of justice there is in me. I extend the principle to communities\r\nof men as well as to individuals. I so extend it because it is\r\npolitically wise as well as naturally just,--politically wise in saving\r\nus from broils about matters which do not concern us. Here, or at\r\nWashington, I would not trouble myself with the oyster laws of Virginia,\r\nor the cranberry laws of Indiana. The doctrine of self-government is\r\nright,--absolutely and internally right; but it has no just application\r\nas here attempted. Or perhaps I should rather say that whether it has\r\nany application here depends upon whether a negro is not or is a man. If\r\nhe is not a man, in that case he who is a man may, as a matter of\r\nself-government, do just what he pleases with him. But if the negro is a\r\nman, is it not to that extent a total destruction of self-government to\r\nsay that he, too, shall not govern himself? When the white man governs\r\nhimself, that is self-government; but when he governs himself and also\r\ngoverns another man, that is more than self-government,--that is\r\ndespotism. If the negro is a man, then my ancient faith teaches me that\r\n"all men are created equal," and that there can be no moral right in\r\nconnection with one man\'s making a slave of another.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas frequently, with bitter irony and sarcasm, paraphrases\r\nour argument by saying: "The white people of Nebraska are good enough to\r\ngovern themselves, but they are not good enough to govern a few\r\nmiserable negroes!"\r\n\r\nWell, I doubt not that the people of Nebraska are and will continue to\r\nbe as good as the average of people elsewhere. I do not say the\r\ncontrary. What I do say is that no man is good enough to govern another\r\nman without that other\'s consent. I say this is the leading\r\nprinciple,--the sheet-anchor of American republicanism.\r\n\r\nSlavery is founded in the selfishness of man\'s nature,--opposition to it\r\nin his love of justice. These principles are in eternal antagonism, and\r\nwhen brought into collision so fiercely as slavery extension brings\r\nthem, shocks and throes and convulsions must ceaselessly follow. Repeal\r\nthe Missouri Compromise; repeal all compromises; repeal the Declaration\r\nof Independence; repeal all past history,--you still cannot repeal human\r\nnature. It still will be the abundance of man\'s heart that slavery\r\nextension is wrong, and out of the abundance of his heart his mouth will\r\ncontinue to speak....\r\n\r\nThe Missouri Compromise ought to be restored. Slavery may or may not be\r\nestablished in Nebraska. But whether it be or not, we shall have\r\nrepudiated--discarded from the councils of the nation--the spirit of\r\ncompromise; for who, after this, will ever trust in a national\r\ncompromise? The spirit of mutual concession--that spirit which first\r\ngave us the Constitution, and has thrice saved the Union--we shall have\r\nstrangled and cast from us for ever. And what shall we have in lieu of\r\nit? The South flushed with triumph and tempted to excess; the North\r\nbetrayed, as they believed, brooding on wrong and burning for revenge.\r\nOne side will provoke, the other resent. The one will taunt, the other\r\ndefy; one aggresses, the other retaliates. Already a few in the North\r\ndefy all constitutional restraints, resist the execution of the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law, and even menace the institution of slavery in the States\r\nwhere it exists. Already a few in the South claim the constitutional\r\nright to take and hold slaves in the free States, demand the revival of\r\nthe slave-trade, and demand a treaty with Great Britain by which\r\nfugitive slaves may be reclaimed from Canada. As yet they are but few on\r\neither side. It is a grave question for lovers of the Union, whether the\r\nfinal destruction of the Missouri Compromise, and with it the spirit of\r\nall compromise, will or will not embolden and embitter each of these,\r\nand fatally increase the number of both.\r\n\r\n... Some men, mostly Whigs, who condemn the repeal of the Missouri\r\nCompromise, nevertheless hesitate to go for its restoration, lest they\r\nbe thrown in company with the Abolitionists. Will they allow me, as an\r\nold Whig, to tell them good-humouredly that I think this is very silly?\r\nStand with anybody that stands right. Stand with him while he is right,\r\nand part with him when he goes wrong. Stand with the Abolitionist in\r\nrestoring the Missouri Compromise, and stand against him when he\r\nattempts to repeal the Fugitive Slave Law. In the latter case you stand\r\nwith the Southern disunionist. What of that? You are still right. In\r\nboth cases you are right In both cases you expose the dangerous\r\nextremes. In both you stand on the middle ground and hold the ship level\r\nand steady. In both you are national, and nothing less than national.\r\nThis is the good old Whig ground. To desert such ground because of any\r\ncompany is to be less than a Whig, less than a man, less than an\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nI particularly object to the new position which the avowed principle of\r\nthis Nebraska law gives to slavery in the body politic. I object to it\r\nbecause it assumes that there can be moral right in the enslaving of one\r\nman by another. I object to it as a dangerous dalliance for free\r\npeople--a sad evidence that, feeling over-prosperity, we forget right;\r\nthat liberty as a principle we have ceased to revere. I object to it\r\nbecause the Fathers of the Republic eschewed and rejected it. The\r\nargument of "necessity" was the only argument they ever admitted in\r\nfavour of slavery, and so far, and so far only as it carried them, did\r\nthey ever go. They found the institution existing among us, which they\r\ncould not help, and they cast the blame on the British king for having\r\npermitted its introduction. Thus we see the plain, unmistakable spirit\r\nof their age towards slavery was hostility to the principle, and\r\ntoleration only by necessity.\r\n\r\nBut now it is to be transformed into a _sacred right_.... Henceforth it\r\nis to be the chief jewel of the nation,--the very figure-head of the\r\nship of State. Little by little, but steadily as man\'s march to the\r\ngrave, we have been giving up the old for the new faith. Near eighty\r\nyears ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal; but now\r\nfrom that beginning we have run down to the other declaration, that for\r\nsome men to enslave others is a sacred right of self-government. These\r\nprinciples cannot stand together. They are as opposite as God and\r\nMammon; and whoever holds to the one must despise the other....\r\n\r\nOur Republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust. Let us purify it.\r\nLet us turn and wash it white in the spirit if not the blood of the\r\nRevolution. Let us turn slavery from its claims of moral right, back\r\nupon its existing legal rights and its arguments of necessity. Let us\r\nreturn it to the position our fathers gave it, and there let it rest in\r\npeace. Let us re-adopt the Declaration of Independence, and with it the\r\npractices and policy which harmonize with it. Let North and South, let\r\nall Americans, let all lovers of liberty everywhere, join in the great\r\nand good work. If we do this, we shall not only have saved the Union,\r\nbut we shall have so saved it as to make and to keep it for ever worthy\r\nof the saving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From Letter to the Hon. Geo. Robertson, Lexington, Kentucky.\r\nSpringfield, Illinois. August 15, 1855_\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir, ... You are not a friend of slavery in the abstract. In\r\nthat speech you spoke of "the peaceful extinction of slavery" and used\r\nother expressions indicating your belief that the thing was, at some\r\ntime, to have an end. Since then we have had thirty-six years of\r\nexperience; and this experience has demonstrated, I think, that there is\r\nno peaceful extinction of slavery in prospect for us. The signal failure\r\nof Henry Clay and other good and great men, in 1849, to effect anything\r\nin favour of gradual emancipation in Kentucky, together with a thousand\r\nother signs, extinguishes that hope utterly. On the question of liberty,\r\nas a principle, we are not what we have been. When we were the political\r\nslaves of King George, and wanted to be free, we called the maxim that\r\n"all men are created equal" a self-evident truth; but now when we have\r\ngrown fat, and have lost all dread of being slaves ourselves, we have\r\nbecome so greedy to be _masters_ that we call the same maxim "a\r\nself-evident lie." The Fourth of July has not quite dwindled away; it is\r\nstill a great day for burning fire-crackers!\r\n\r\nThat spirit which desired the peaceful extinction of slavery has itself\r\nbecome extinct with the _occasion_ and the _men_ of the Revolution.\r\nUnder the impulse of that occasion, nearly half the States adopted\r\nsystems of emancipation at once; and it is a significant fact that not a\r\nsingle State has done the like since. So far as peaceful, voluntary\r\nemancipation is concerned, the condition of the negro slave in America,\r\nscarcely less terrible to the contemplation of the free mind, is now as\r\nfixed and hopeless of change for the better as that of the lost souls of\r\nthe finally impenitent. The Autocrat of all the Russias will resign his\r\ncrown and proclaim his subjects free republicans, sooner than will our\r\nAmerican masters voluntarily give up their slaves.\r\n\r\nOur political problem now is, "Can we as a nation continue together\r\n_permanently--for ever_--half slave, and half free?" The problem is too\r\nmighty for me. May God in his mercy superintend the solution.\r\n\r\n     Your much obliged friend, and humble servant,\r\n       A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extracts from Letter to Joshua F. Speed. August 24, 1855_\r\n\r\n\r\nYou suggest that in political action now, you and I would differ. I\r\nsuppose we would; not quite so much, however, as you may think. You know\r\nI dislike slavery, and you fully admit the abstract wrong of it. So far\r\nthere is no cause of difference. But you say that sooner than yield your\r\nlegal right to the slave, especially at the bidding of those who are not\r\nthemselves interested, you would see the Union dissolved. I am not aware\r\nthat any one is bidding you yield that right; very certainly I am not. I\r\nleave that matter entirely to yourself. I also acknowledge your rights\r\nand my obligations under the Constitution in regard to your slaves. I\r\nconfess I hate to see the poor creatures hunted down and caught and\r\ncarried back to their stripes and unrequited toil; but I bite my lips\r\nand keep quiet. In 1841, you and I had together a tedious low-water trip\r\non a steamboat, from Louisville to St. Louis. You may remember, as I\r\nwell do, that from Louisville to the mouth of the Ohio, there were on\r\nboard ten or a dozen slaves shackled together with irons. That sight was\r\na continued torment to me, and I see something like it every time I\r\ntouch the Ohio or any other slave border. It is not fair for you to\r\nassume that I have no interest in a thing which has, and continually\r\nexercises, the power of making me miserable. You ought rather to\r\nappreciate how much the great body of the Northern people do crucify\r\ntheir feelings in order to maintain their loyalty to the Constitution\r\nand the Union. I do oppose the extension of slavery, because my judgment\r\nand feeling so prompt me, and I am under no obligations to the contrary.\r\nIf for this you and I must differ, differ we must. You say if you were\r\nPresident, you would send an army and hang the leaders of the Missouri\r\noutrages upon the Kansas elections; still, if Kansas fairly votes\r\nherself a slave State she must be admitted, or the Union must be\r\ndissolved. But how if she votes herself a slave State unfairly; that\r\nis, by the very means for which you say you would hang men? Must she\r\nstill be admitted, or the Union dissolved? That will be the phase of the\r\nquestion when it first becomes a practical one. In your assumption that\r\nthere may be a fair decision of the slavery question in Kansas, I\r\nplainly see that you and I would differ about the Nebraska law. I look\r\nupon that enactment, not as a law, but as a violence from the beginning.\r\nIt was conceived in violence, is maintained in violence, and is being\r\nexecuted in violence. I say it was conceived in violence, because the\r\ndestruction of the Missouri Compromise, under the circumstances, was\r\nnothing less than violence. It was passed in violence, because it could\r\nnot have passed at all but for the votes of many members in violence of\r\nthe known will of their constituents. It is maintained in violence,\r\nbecause the elections since clearly demand its repeal, and the demand is\r\nopenly disregarded.\r\n\r\nYou say men ought to be hung for the way they are executing the law; I\r\nsay that the way it is being executed is quite as good as any of its\r\nantecedents. It is being executed in the precise way which was intended\r\nfrom the first, else why does no Nebraska man express astonishment or\r\ncondemnation? Poor Reeder is the only public man who has been silly\r\nenough to believe that anything like fairness was ever intended, and he\r\nhas been bravely undeceived.\r\n\r\nThat Kansas will form a slave constitution, and with it ask to be\r\nadmitted into the Union, I take to be already a settled question, and so\r\nsettled by the very means you so pointedly condemn. By every principle\r\nof law ever held by any court North or South, every negro taken to\r\nKansas _is_ free; yet in utter disregard of this--in the spirit of\r\nviolence merely--that beautiful Legislature gravely passes a law to hang\r\nany man who shall venture to inform a negro of his legal rights. This is\r\nthe subject and real object of the law. If, like Haman, they should hang\r\nupon the gallows of their own building, I shall not be among the\r\nmourners for their fate. In my humble sphere, I shall advocate the\r\nrestoration of the Missouri Compromise so long as Kansas remains a\r\nTerritory; and when, by all these foul means, it seeks to come into the\r\nUnion as a slave State, I shall oppose it. I am very loath in any case\r\nto withhold my assent to the enjoyment of property acquired or located\r\nin good faith; but I do not admit that good faith in taking a negro to\r\nKansas to be held in slavery is a probability with any man. Any man who\r\nhas sense enough to be the controller of his own property has too much\r\nsense to misunderstand the outrageous character of the whole Nebraska\r\nbusiness. But I digress. In my opposition to the admission of Kansas, I\r\nshall have some company, but we may be beaten. If we are, I shall not,\r\non that account, attempt to dissolve the Union. I think it probable,\r\nhowever, we shall be beaten. Standing as a unit among yourselves, you\r\ncan, directly and indirectly, bribe enough of our men to carry the day,\r\nas you could on the open proposition to establish a monarchy. Get hold\r\nof some man in the North whose position and ability are such that he can\r\nmake the support of your measure, whatever it may be, a Democratic-party\r\nnecessity, and the thing is done. Apropos of this, let me tell you an\r\nanecdote. Douglas introduced the Nebraska Bill in January. In February\r\nafterward, there was a called session of the Illinois Legislature. Of\r\nthe one hundred members composing the two branches of that body, about\r\nseventy were Democrats. These latter held a caucus, in which the\r\nNebraska Bill was talked of, if not formally discussed. It was thereby\r\ndiscovered that just three, and no more, were in favour of the measure.\r\nIn a day or two Douglas\'s orders came on to have resolutions passed\r\napproving the bill; and they were passed by large majorities! The truth\r\nof this is vouched for by a bolting Democratic member. The masses too,\r\nDemocratic as well as Whig, were even nearer unanimous against it; but\r\nas soon as the party necessity of supporting it became apparent, the way\r\nthe Democrats began to see the wisdom and justice of it was perfectly\r\nastonishing.\r\n\r\nYou say that if Kansas fairly votes herself a free State, as a Christian\r\nyou will rejoice at it. All decent slaveholders talk that way, and I do\r\nnot doubt their candour; but they never vote that way. Although in a\r\nprivate letter or conversation you will express your preference that\r\nKansas should be free, you would vote for no man for Congress who would\r\nsay the same thing publicly. No such man could be elected from any\r\ndistrict in a slave State. You think Stringfellow and company ought to\r\nbe hung.... The slave-breeders and slave-traders are a small, odious,\r\nand detested class among you; and yet in politics they dictate the\r\ncourse of all of you, and are as completely your masters as you are the\r\nmaster of your own negroes. You inquire where I now stand. That is a\r\ndisputed point. I think I am a Whig; but others say there are no Whigs,\r\nand that I am an Abolitionist. When I was at Washington, I voted for the\r\nWilmot Proviso as good as forty times; and I never heard of any one\r\nattempting to unwhig me for that. I now do no more than oppose the\r\nextension of slavery. I am not a Know-nothing; that is certain. How\r\ncould I be? How can any one who abhors the oppression of negroes be in\r\nfavour of degrading classes of white people? Our progress in degeneracy\r\nappears to me to be pretty rapid. As a nation, we began by declaring\r\nthat _all men are created equal_. We now practically read it, _all men\r\nare created equal except negroes_. When the Know-nothings get control,\r\nit will read, _all men are created equal except negroes_ and foreigners\r\nand Catholics. When it comes to this, I shall prefer emigrating to some\r\ncountry where they make no pretence of loving liberty--to Russia, for\r\ninstance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy\r\nof hypocrisy.... My kindest regards to Mrs. Speed. On the leading\r\nsubject of this letter I have more of her sympathy than I have of yours;\r\nand yet let me say I am your friend for ever.\r\n\r\n     A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln\'s Speech. May 19, 1856_\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I was over at [cries of "Platform!" "Take\r\nthe platform!"]--I say, that while I was at Danville Court, some of our\r\nfriends of anti-Nebraska got together in Springfield and elected me as\r\none delegate to represent old Sangamon with them in this convention, and\r\nI am here certainly as a sympathizer in this movement and by virtue of\r\nthat meeting and selection. But we can hardly be called delegates\r\nstrictly, inasmuch as, properly speaking, we represent nobody but\r\nourselves. I think it altogether fair to say that we have no\r\nanti-Nebraska party in Sangamon, although there is a good deal of\r\nanti-Nebraska feeling there; but I say for myself, and I think I may\r\nspeak also for my colleagues, that we who are here fully approve of the\r\nplatform and of all that has been done [A voice: "Yes!"]; and even if we\r\nare not regularly delegates, it will be right for me to answer your call\r\nto speak. I suppose we truly stand for the public sentiment of Sangamon\r\non the great question of the repeal, although we do not yet represent\r\nmany numbers who have taken a distinct position on the question.\r\n\r\nWe are in a trying time--it ranges above mere party--and this movement\r\nto call a halt and turn our steps backward needs all the help and good\r\ncounsels it can get; for unless popular opinion makes itself very\r\nstrongly felt, and a change is made in our present course, _blood will\r\nflow on account of Nebraska, and brother\'s hand will be raised against\r\nbrother_! [The last sentence was uttered in such an earnest, impressive,\r\nif not, indeed, tragic, manner, as to make a cold chill creep over me.\r\nOthers gave a similar experience.]\r\n\r\nI have listened with great interest to the earnest appeal made to\r\nIllinois men by the gentleman from Lawrence [James S. Emery] who has\r\njust addressed us so eloquently and forcibly. I was deeply moved by his\r\nstatement of the wrongs done to free-State men out there. I think it\r\njust to say that all true men North should sympathize with them, and\r\nought to be willing to do any possible and needful thing to right their\r\nwrongs. But we must not promise what we ought not, lest we be called on\r\nto perform what we cannot; we must be calm and moderate, and consider\r\nthe whole difficulty, and determine what is possible and just. We must\r\nnot be led by excitement and passion to do that which our sober\r\njudgments would not approve in our cooler moments. We have higher aims;\r\nwe will have more serious business than to dally with temporary\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nWe are here to stand firmly for a principle--to stand firmly for a\r\nright. We know that great political and moral wrongs are done, and\r\noutrages committed, and we denounce those wrongs and outrages, although\r\nwe cannot, at present, do much more. But we desire to reach out beyond\r\nthose personal outrages and establish a rule that will apply to all, and\r\nso prevent any future outrages.\r\n\r\nWe have seen to-day that every shade of popular opinion is represented\r\nhere, with _Freedom_ or rather _Free-Soil_ as the basis. We have come\r\ntogether as in some sort representatives of popular opinion against the\r\nextension of slavery into territory now free in fact as well as by law,\r\nand the pledged word of the statesmen of the nation who are now no more.\r\nWe come--we are here assembled together--to protest as well as we can\r\nagainst a great wrong, and to take measures, as well as we now can, to\r\nmake that wrong right; to place the nation, as far as it may be possible\r\nnow, as it was before the repeal of the Missouri Compromise; and the\r\nplain way to do this is to restore the Compromise, and to demand and\r\ndetermine that _Kansas shall be free!_ [Immense applause.] While we\r\naffirm, and reaffirm, if necessary, our devotion to the principles of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, let our practical work here be limited\r\nto the above. We know that there is not a perfect agreement of sentiment\r\nhere on the public questions which might be rightfully considered in\r\nthis convention, and that the indignation which we all must feel cannot\r\nbe helped; but all of us must give up something for the good of the\r\ncause. There is one desire which is uppermost in the mind, one wish\r\ncommon to us all--to which no dissent will be made; and I counsel you\r\nearnestly to bury all resentment, to sink all personal feeling, make all\r\nthings work to a common purpose in which we are united and agreed about,\r\nand which all present will agree is absolutely necessary--which _must_\r\nbe done by any rightful mode if there be such: _Slavery must be kept out\r\nof Kansas_! [Applause.] The test--the pinch--is right there. If we lose\r\nKansas to freedom, an example will be set which will prove fatal to\r\nfreedom in the end. We, therefore, in the language of the _Bible_, must\r\n"lay the axe to the root of the tree." Temporizing will not do longer;\r\nnow is the time for decision--for firm, persistent, resolute action.\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska bill, or rather Nebraska law, is not one of wholesome\r\nlegislation, but was and is an act of legislative usurpation, whose\r\nresult, if not indeed intention, is to make slavery national; and unless\r\nheaded off in some effective way, we are in a fair way to see this land\r\nof boasted freedom converted into a land of slavery in fact.\r\n[Sensation.] Just open your two eyes, and see if this be not so. I need\r\ndo no more than state, to command universal approval, that almost the\r\nentire North, as well as a large following in the border States, is\r\nradically opposed to the planting of slavery in free territory. Probably\r\nin a popular vote throughout the nation nine-tenths of the voters in the\r\nfree States, and at least one-half in the border States, if they could\r\nexpress their sentiments freely, would vote NO on such an issue; and it\r\nis safe to say that two-thirds of the votes of the entire nation would\r\nbe opposed to it. And yet, in spite of this overbalancing of sentiment\r\nin this free country, we are in a fair way to see Kansas present itself\r\nfor admission as a slave State. Indeed, it is a felony, by the local law\r\nof Kansas, to deny that slavery exists there even now. By every\r\nprinciple of law, a negro in Kansas is free; yet the _bogus_\r\nlegislature makes it an infamous crime to tell him that he is free!\r\n\r\nThe party lash and the fear of ridicule will overawe justice and\r\nliberty; for it is a singular fact, but none the less a fact, and well\r\nknown by the most common experience, that men will do things under the\r\nterror of the party lash that they would not on any account or for any\r\nconsideration do otherwise; while men who will march up to the mouth of\r\na loaded cannon without shrinking, will run from the terrible name of\r\n"Abolitionist," even when pronounced by a worthless creature whom they,\r\nwith good reason, despise. For instance--to press this point a\r\nlittle--Judge Douglas introduced his anti-Nebraska bill in January; and\r\nwe had an extra session of our legislature in the succeeding February,\r\nin which were seventy-five Democrats; and at a party caucus, fully\r\nattended, there were just three votes out of the whole seventy-five, for\r\nthe measure. But in a few days orders came on from Washington,\r\ncommanding them to approve the measure; the party lash was applied, and\r\nit was brought up again in caucus, and passed by a large majority. The\r\nmasses were against it, but party necessity carried it; and it was\r\npassed through the lower house of Congress against the will of the\r\npeople, for the same reason. Here is where the greatest danger\r\nlies--that, while we profess to be a government of law and reason, law\r\nwill give way to violence on demand of this awful and crushing power.\r\nLike the great Juggernaut--I think that is the name--the great idol, it\r\ncrushes everything that comes in its way, and makes a--or as I read\r\nonce, in a black-letter law book, "a slave is a human being who is\r\nlegally not a _person_, but a _thing_." And if the safeguards to liberty\r\nare broken down, as is now attempted, when they have made _things_ of\r\nall the free negroes, how long, think you, before they will begin to\r\nmake _things_ of poor white men? [Applause.] Be not deceived.\r\nRevolutions do not go backward. The founder of the Democratic party\r\ndeclared that _all_ men were created equal. His successor in the\r\nleadership has written the word "white" before men, making it read "all\r\n_white_ men are created equal." Pray, will or may not the Know-nothings,\r\nif they should get in power, add the word "protestant," making it read\r\n"_all protestant white men_"?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the hapless negro is the fruitful subject of reprisals in\r\nother quarters. John Pettit, whom Tom Benton paid his respects to, you\r\nwill recollect, calls the immortal Declaration "a self-evident lie;"\r\nwhile at the birth-place of freedom--in the shadow of Bunker Hill and of\r\nthe "cradle of liberty," at the home of the Adamses and Warren and\r\nOtis--Choate, from our side of the house, dares to fritter away the\r\nbirthday promise of liberty by proclaiming the Declaration to be "a\r\nstring of glittering generalities;" and the Southern Whigs, working hand\r\nin hand with pro-slavery Democrats, are making Choate\'s theories\r\npractical. Thomas Jefferson, a slaveholder, mindful of the moral element\r\nin slavery, solemnly declared that he "trembled for his country when he\r\nremembered that God is just;" while Judge Douglas, with an insignificant\r\nwave of the hand, "don\'t care whether slavery is voted up or voted\r\ndown." Now, if slavery is right, or even negative, he has a right to\r\ntreat it in this trifling manner. But if it is a moral and political\r\nwrong, as all Christendom considers it to be, how can he answer to God\r\nfor this attempt to spread and fortify it? [Applause.]\r\n\r\nBut no man, and Judge Douglas no more than any other, can maintain a\r\nnegative, or merely neutral, position on this question; and,\r\naccordingly, he avows that the Union was made _by_ white men and _for_\r\nwhite men and their descendants. As matter of fact, the first branch of\r\nthe proposition is historically true; the government was made by white\r\nmen, and they were and are the superior race. This I admit. But the\r\ncorner-stone of the government, so to speak, was the declaration that\r\n"_all_ men are created equal," and all entitled to "life, liberty, and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness." [Applause.]\r\n\r\nAnd not only so, but the framers of the Constitution were particular to\r\nkeep out of that instrument the word "slave," the reason being that\r\nslavery would ultimately come to an end, and they did not wish to have\r\nany reminder that in this free country human beings were ever\r\nprostituted to slavery. [Applause.] Nor is it any argument that we are\r\nsuperior and the negro inferior--that he has but one talent while we\r\nhave ten. Let the negro possess the little he has in independence; if he\r\nhas but one talent, he should be permitted to keep the little he has.\r\n[Applause.] But slavery will endure no test of reason or logic; and yet\r\nits advocates, like Douglas, use a sort of bastard logic, or noisy\r\nassumption, it might better be termed, like the above, in order to\r\nprepare the mind for the gradual, but none the less certain,\r\nencroachments of the Moloch of slavery upon, the fair domain of freedom.\r\nBut however much you may argue upon it, or smother it in soft phrases,\r\nslavery can only be maintained by force--by violence. The repeal of the\r\nMissouri Compromise was by violence. It was a violation of both law and\r\nthe sacred obligations of honour, to overthrow and trample underfoot a\r\nsolemn compromise, obtained by the fearful loss to freedom of one of the\r\nfairest of our Western domains. Congress violated the will and\r\nconfidence of its constituents in voting for the bill; and while public\r\nsentiment, as shown by the elections of 1854, demanded the restoration\r\nof this compromise, Congress violated its trust by refusing, simply\r\nbecause it had the force of numbers to hold on to it. And murderous\r\nviolence is being used now, in order to force slavery on to Kansas; for\r\nit cannot be done in any other way. [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nThe necessary result was to establish the rule of violence--force,\r\ninstead of the rule of law and reason; to perpetuate and spread slavery,\r\nand, in time, to make it general. We see it at both ends of the line. In\r\nWashington, on the very spot where the outrage was started, the fearless\r\nSumner is beaten to insensibility, and is now slowly dying; while\r\nsenators who claim to be gentlemen and Christians stood by,\r\ncountenancing the act, and even applauding it afterward in their places\r\nin the Senate. Even Douglas, our man, saw it all and was within helping\r\ndistance, yet let the murderous blows fall unopposed. Then, at the other\r\nend of the line, at the very time Sumner was being murdered, Lawrence\r\nwas being destroyed for the crime of Freedom. It was the most prominent\r\nstronghold of liberty in Kansas, and must give way to the all-dominating\r\npower of slavery. Only two days ago, Judge Trumbull found it necessary\r\nto propose a bill in the Senate to prevent a general civil war and to\r\nrestore peace in Kansas.\r\n\r\nWe live in the midst of alarms; anxiety beclouds the future; we expect\r\nsome new disaster with each newspaper we read. Are we in a healthful\r\npolitical state? Are not the tendencies plain? Do not the signs of the\r\ntimes point plainly the way in which we are going? [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Constitution slavery was recognized, by South\r\nand North alike, as an evil, and the division of sentiment about it was\r\nnot controlled by geographical lines or considerations of climate, but\r\nby moral and philanthropic views. Petitions for the abolition of slavery\r\nwere presented to the very first Congress by Virginia and Massachusetts\r\nalike. To show the harmony which prevailed, I will state that a fugitive\r\nslave law was passed in 1793, with no dissenting voice in the Senate,\r\nand but seven dissenting votes in the House. It was, however, a wise\r\nlaw, moderate, and, under the Constitution, a just one. Twenty-five\r\nyears later, a more stringent law was proposed and defeated; and\r\nthirty-five years after that, the present law, drafted by Mason of\r\nVirginia, was passed by Northern votes. I am not, just now, complaining\r\nof this law, but I am trying to show how the current sets; for the\r\nproposed law of 1817 was far less offensive than the present one. In\r\n1774 the Continental Congress pledged itself, without a dissenting vote,\r\nto wholly discontinue the slave trade, and to neither purchase nor\r\nimport any slave: and less than three months before the passage of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, the same Congress which adopted that\r\ndeclaration unanimously resolved "that _no slave be imported into any of\r\nthe thirteen United Colonies_." [Great applause.]\r\n\r\nOn the second day of July, 1776, the draft of a Declaration of\r\nIndependence was reported to Congress by the committee, and in it the\r\nslave trade was characterized as "an execrable commerce," as "a\r\npiratical warfare," as the "opprobrium of infidel powers," and as "a\r\ncruel war against human nature." [Applause.] All agreed on this except\r\nSouth Carolina and Georgia, and in order to preserve harmony, and from\r\nthe necessity of the case, these expressions were omitted. Indeed,\r\nabolition societies existed as far south as Virginia; and it is a\r\nwell-known fact that Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Lee, Henry, Mason,\r\nand Pendleton were qualified abolitionists, and much more radical on\r\nthat subject than we of the Whig and Democratic parties claim to be\r\nto-day. On March 1, 1784, Virginia ceded to the confederation all its\r\nlands lying northwest of the Ohio River. Jefferson, Chase of Maryland,\r\nand Howell of Rhode Island, as a committee on that and territory\r\nthereafter _to be ceded_, reported that no slavery should exist after\r\nthe year 1800. Had this report been adopted, not only the Northwest, but\r\nKentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi also would have been free;\r\nbut it required the assent of nine States to ratify it. North Carolina\r\nwas divided, and thus its vote was lost; and Delaware, Georgia, and New\r\nJersey refused to vote. In point of fact, as it was, it was assented to\r\nby six States. Three years later, on a square vote to exclude slavery\r\nfrom the Northwest, only one vote, and that from New York, was against\r\nit. And yet, thirty-seven years later, five thousand citizens of\r\nIllinois out of a voting mass of less than twelve thousand,\r\ndeliberately, after a long and heated contest, voted to introduce\r\nslavery in Illinois; and, to-day, a large party in the free State of\r\nIllinois are willing to vote to fasten the shackles of slavery on the\r\nfair domain of Kansas, notwithstanding it received the dowry of freedom\r\nlong before its birth as a political community. I repeat, therefore, the\r\nquestion, Is it not plain in what direction we are tending? [Sensation.]\r\nIn the colonial time, Mason, Pendleton, and Jefferson were as hostile to\r\nslavery in Virginia as Otis, Ames, and the Adamses were in\r\nMassachusetts; and Virginia made as earnest an effort to get rid of it\r\nas old Massachusetts did. But circumstances were against them and they\r\nfailed; but not that the good-will of its leading men was lacking. Yet\r\nwithin less than fifty years Virginia changed its tune, and made\r\nnegro-breeding for the cotton and sugar States one of its leading\r\nindustries. [Laughter and applause.]\r\n\r\nIn the Constitutional Convention, George Mason of Virginia made a more\r\nviolent abolition speech than my friends Lovejoy or Codding would desire\r\nto make here to-day--a speech which could not be safely repeated\r\nanywhere on Southern soil in this enlightened year. But while there were\r\nsome differences of opinion on this subject even then, discussion was\r\nallowed; but as you see by the Kansas slave code, which, as you know, is\r\nthe Missouri slave code, merely ferried across the river, it is a felony\r\nto even express an opinion hostile to that foul blot in the land of\r\nWashington and the Declaration of Independence. [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky--my State--in 1849, on a test vote, the mighty influence of\r\nHenry Clay and many other good men there could not get a symptom of\r\nexpression in favour of gradual emancipation on a plain issue of\r\nmarching toward the light of civilization with Ohio and Illinois; but\r\nthe State of Boone and Hardin and Henry Clay, with a _nigger_ under each\r\narm, took the black trail toward the deadly swamps of barbarism. Is\r\nthere--can there be--any doubt about this thing? And is there any doubt\r\nthat we must all lay aside our prejudices and march, shoulder to\r\nshoulder, in the great army of Freedom? [Applause.]\r\n\r\nEvery Fourth of July our young orators all proclaim this to be "the land\r\nof the _free_ and the home of the brave!" Well, now, when you orators\r\nget that off next year, and, may be, this very year, how would you like\r\nsome old grizzled farmer to get up in the grove and deny it? [Laughter.]\r\nHow would you like that? But suppose Kansas comes in as a slave State,\r\nand all the "border ruffians" have barbecues about it, and free-State\r\nmen come trailing back to the dishonoured North, like whipped dogs with\r\ntheir tails between their legs, it is--ain\'t it?--evident that this is\r\nno more the "land of the free;" and if we let it go so, we won\'t dare to\r\nsay "home of the brave" out loud. [Sensation and confusion.]\r\n\r\nCan any man doubt that, even in spite of the people\'s will, slavery will\r\ntriumph through violence, unless that will be made manifest and\r\nenforced? Even Governor Reeder claimed at the outset that the contest in\r\nKansas was to be fair, but he got his eyes open at last; and I believe\r\nthat, as a result of this moral and physical violence, Kansas will soon\r\napply for admission as a slave State. And yet we can\'t mistake that the\r\npeople don\'t want it so, and that it is a land which is free both by\r\nnatural and political law. _No law is free law!_ Such is the\r\nunderstanding of all Christendom. In the Somerset case, decided nearly a\r\ncentury ago, the great Lord Mansfield held that slavery was of such a\r\nnature that it must take its rise in _positive_ (as distinguished from\r\n_natural_) law; and that in no country or age could it be traced back to\r\nany other source. Will some one please tell me where is the _positive_\r\nlaw that establishes slavery in Kansas? [A voice: "The _bogus_ laws."]\r\nAye, the _bogus_ laws! And, on the same principle, a gang of Missouri\r\nhorse-thieves could come into Illinois and declare horse-stealing to be\r\nlegal [Laughter], and it would be just as legal as slavery is in Kansas.\r\nBut by express statute, in the land of Washington and Jefferson, we may\r\nsoon be brought face to face with the discreditable fact of showing to\r\nthe world by our acts that we prefer slavery to freedom--darkness to\r\nlight! [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nIt is, I believe, a principle in law that when one party to a contract\r\nviolates it so grossly as to chiefly destroy the object for which it is\r\nmade, the other party may rescind it. I will ask Browning if that ain\'t\r\ngood law. [Voices: "Yes!"] Well, now if that be right, I go for\r\nrescinding the whole, entire Missouri Compromise and thus turning\r\nMissouri into a free State; and I should like to know the\r\ndifference--should like for any one to point out the difference--between\r\n_our_ making a free State of Missouri and _their_ making a slave State\r\nof Kansas. [Great applause.] There ain\'t one bit of difference, except\r\nthat our way would be a great mercy to humanity. But I have never\r\nsaid--and the Whig party has never said--and those who oppose the\r\nNebraska bill do not as a body say, that they have any intention of\r\ninterfering with slavery in the slave States. Our platform says just the\r\ncontrary. We allow slavery to exist in the slave States--not because\r\nslavery is right or good, but from the necessities of our Union. We\r\ngrant a fugitive slave law because it is so "nominated in the bond;"\r\nbecause our fathers so stipulated--had to--and we are bound to carry out\r\nthis agreement. But they did not agree to introduce slavery in regions\r\nwhere it did not previously exist. On the contrary, they said by their\r\nexample and teachings that they did not deem it expedient--did not\r\nconsider it right--to do so; and it is wise and right to do just as they\r\ndid about it [Voices: "Good!"], and that is what we propose--not to\r\ninterfere with slavery where it exists (we have never tried to do it),\r\nand to give them a reasonable and efficient fugitive slave law. [A\r\nvoice: "No!"] I say YES! [Applause.] It was part of the bargain, and I\'m\r\nfor living up to it; but I go no further; I\'m not bound to do more, and\r\nI won\'t agree any further. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\nWe, here in Illinois, should feel especially proud of the provision of\r\nthe Missouri Compromise excluding slavery from what is now Kansas; for\r\nan Illinois man, Jesse B. Thomas, was its father. Henry Clay, who is\r\ncredited with the authorship of the Compromise in general terms, did not\r\neven vote for that provision, but only advocated the ultimate admission\r\nby a second compromise; and, Thomas was, beyond all controversy, the\r\nreal author of the "slavery restriction" branch of the Compromise. To\r\nshow the generosity of the Northern members toward the Southern side; on\r\na test vote to exclude slavery from Missouri, ninety voted not to\r\nexclude, and eighty-seven to exclude, every vote from the slave States\r\nbeing ranged with the former and fourteen votes from the free States,\r\nof whom seven were from New England alone; while on a vote to exclude\r\nslavery from what is now Kansas, the vote was one hundred and\r\nthirty-four _for_ to forty-two _against_. The scheme, as a whole, was,\r\nof course, a Southern triumph. It is idle to contend otherwise, as is\r\nnow being done by the Nebraskaites; it was so shown by the votes and\r\nquite as emphatically by the expressions of representative men. Mr.\r\nLowndes of South Carolina was never known to commit a political mistake;\r\nhis was the great judgment of that section; and he declared that this\r\nmeasure "would restore tranquillity to the country--a result demanded by\r\nevery consideration of discretion, of moderation, of wisdom, and of\r\nvirtue." When the measure came before President Monroe for his approval,\r\nhe put to each member of his cabinet this question: "Has Congress the\r\nconstitutional power to prohibit slavery in a territory?" And John C.\r\nCalhoun and William H. Crawford from the South, equally with John Quincy\r\nAdams, Benjamin Rush, and Smith Thompson from the North, alike answered,\r\n"_Yes!_" without qualification or equivocation; and this measure, of so\r\ngreat consequence to the South, was passed; and Missouri was, by means\r\nof it, finally enabled to knock at the door of the Republic for an open\r\npassage to its brood of slaves. And, in spite of this, Freedom\'s share\r\nis about to be taken by violence--by the force of misrepresentative\r\nvotes, not called for by the popular will. What name can I, in common\r\ndecency, give to this wicked transaction? [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nBut even then the contest was not over; for when the Missouri\r\nconstitution came before Congress for its approval, it forbade any free\r\nnegro or mulatto from entering the State. In short, our Illinois "black\r\nlaws" were hidden away in their constitution [Laughter], and the\r\ncontroversy was thus revived. Then it was that Mr. Clay\'s talents shone\r\nout conspicuously, and the controversy that shook the Union to its\r\nfoundation was finally settled to the satisfaction of the conservative\r\nparties on both sides of the line, though not to the extremists on\r\neither, and Missouri was admitted by the small majority of six in the\r\nlower House. How great a majority, do you think, would have been given\r\nhad Kansas also been secured for slavery? [A voice: "A majority the\r\nother way."] "A majority the other way," is answered. Do you think it\r\nwould have been safe for a Northern man to have confronted his\r\nconstituents after having voted to consign both Missouri and Kansas to\r\nhopeless slavery? And yet this man Douglas, who misrepresents his\r\nconstituents, and who has exerted his highest talents in that direction,\r\nwill be carried in triumph through the State, and hailed with honour\r\nwhile applauding that act. [Three groans for "_Dug_!"] And this shows\r\nwhither we are tending. This thing of slavery is more powerful than its\r\nsupporters--even than the high priests that minister at its altar. It\r\ndebauches even our greatest men. It gathers strength, like a rolling\r\nsnow-ball, by its own infamy. Monstrous crimes are committed in its name\r\nby persons collectively which they would not dare to commit as\r\nindividuals. Its aggressions and encroachments almost surpass belief. In\r\na despotism, one might not wonder to see slavery advance steadily and\r\nremorselessly into new dominions; but is it not wonderful, is it not\r\neven alarming, to see its steady advance in a land dedicated to the\r\nproposition that "all men are created equal"? [Sensation.]\r\n\r\nIt yields nothing itself; it keeps all it has, and gets all it can\r\nbesides. It really came dangerously near securing Illinois in 1824; it\r\ndid get Missouri in 1821. The first proposition was to admit what is now\r\nArkansas _and_ Missouri as one slave State. But the territory was\r\ndivided, and Arkansas came in, without serious question, as a slave\r\nState; and afterward Missouri, not as a sort of equality, _free_, but\r\nalso as a slave State. Then we had Florida and Texas; and now Kansas is\r\nabout to be forced into the dismal procession. [Sensation.] And so it is\r\nwherever you look. We have not forgotten--it is but six years since--how\r\ndangerously near California came to being a slave State. Texas is a\r\nslave State, and four other slave States may be carved from its vast\r\ndomain. And yet, in the year 1829, slavery was abolished throughout\r\nthat vast region by a royal decree of the then sovereign of Mexico. Will\r\nyou please tell me by what _right_ slavery exists in Texas to-day? By\r\nthe same right as, and no higher or greater than, slavery is seeking\r\ndominion in Kansas: by political force--peaceful, if that will suffice;\r\nby the torch (as in Kansas) and the bludgeon (as in the Senate chamber),\r\nif required. And so history repeats itself; and even as slavery has kept\r\nits course by craft, intimidation, and violence in the past, so it will\r\npersist, in my judgment, until met and dominated by the will of a people\r\nbent on its restriction.\r\n\r\nWe have, this very afternoon, heard bitter denunciations of Brooks in\r\nWashington, and Titus, Stringfellow, Atchison, Jones, and Shannon in\r\nKansas--the battle-ground of slavery. I certainly am not going to\r\nadvocate or shield them; but they and their acts are but the necessary\r\noutcome of the Nebraska law. We should reserve our highest censure for\r\nthe authors of the mischief, and not for the catspaws which they use. I\r\nbelieve it was Shakespeare who said, "Where the offence lies, there let\r\nthe axe fall;" and, in my opinion, this man Douglas and the Northern men\r\nin Congress who advocate "Nebraska" are more guilty than a thousand\r\nJoneses and Stringfellows, with all their murderous practices, can be.\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\nWe have made a good beginning here to-day. As our Methodist friends\r\nwould say, "I feel it is good to be here." While extremists may find\r\nsome fault with the moderation of our platform, they should recollect\r\nthat "the battle is not always to the strong, nor the race to the\r\nswift." In grave emergencies, moderation is generally safer than\r\nradicalism: and as this struggle is likely to be long and earnest, we\r\nmust not, by our action, repel any who are in sympathy with us in the\r\nmain, but rather win all that we can to our standard. We must not\r\nbelittle nor overlook the facts of our condition--that we are new and\r\ncomparatively weak, while our enemies are entrenched and relatively\r\nstrong. They have the administration and the political power; and, right\r\nor wrong, at present they have the numbers. Our friends who urge an\r\nappeal to arms with so much force and eloquence, should recollect that\r\nthe government is arrayed against us, and that the numbers are now\r\narrayed against us as well; or, to state it nearer to the truth, they\r\nare not yet expressly and affirmatively for us; and we should repel\r\nfriends rather than gain them by anything savouring of revolutionary\r\nmethods. As it now stands, we must appeal to the sober sense and\r\npatriotism of the people. We will make converts day by day; we will grow\r\nstrong by calmness and moderation; we will grow strong by the violence\r\nand injustice of our adversaries. And, unless truth be a mockery and\r\njustice a hollow lie, we will be in the majority after a while, and then\r\nthe revolution which we will accomplish will be none the less radical\r\nfrom being the result of pacific measures. The battle of freedom is to\r\nbe fought out on principle. Slavery is a violation of the eternal right.\r\nWe have temporized with it from the necessities of our condition; but\r\n_as sure as God reigns and school children read_, THAT BLACK FOUL LIE\r\nCAN NEVER BE CONSECRATED INTO GOD\'S HALLOWED TRUTH! [Immense applause\r\nlasting some time.] One of our greatest difficulties is, that men who\r\n_know_ that slavery is a detestable crime and ruinous to the nation, are\r\ncompelled, by our peculiar condition and other circumstances, to\r\nadvocate it concretely, though damning it in the raw. Henry Clay was a\r\nbrilliant example of this tendency; others of our purest statesmen are\r\ncompelled to do so; and thus slavery secures actual support from those\r\nwho detest it at heart. Yet Henry Clay perfected and forced through the\r\nCompromise which secured to slavery a great State as well as a political\r\nadvantage. Not that he hated slavery less, but that he loved the whole\r\nUnion more. As long as slavery profited by his great Compromise, the\r\nhosts of pro-slavery could not sufficiently cover him with praise; but\r\nnow that this Compromise stands in their way--\r\n\r\n     "...they never mention him,\r\n     His name is never heard:\r\n     Their lips are now forbid to speak\r\n     That once familiar word."\r\n\r\nThey have slaughtered one of his most cherished measures, and his ghost\r\nwould arise to rebuke them. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\nNow, let us harmonize, my friends, and appeal to the moderation and\r\npatriotism of the people: to the sober second thought; to the awakened\r\npublic conscience. The repeal of the sacred Missouri Compromise has\r\ninstalled the weapons of violence: the bludgeon, the incendiary torch,\r\nthe death-dealing rifle, the bristling cannon--the weapons of kingcraft,\r\nof the inquisition, of ignorance, of barbarism, of oppression. We see\r\nits fruits in the dying bed of the heroic Sumner; in the ruins of the\r\n"Free State" hotel; in the smoking embers of the _Herald of Freedom_; in\r\nthe free-State Governor of Kansas chained to a stake on freedom\'s soil\r\nlike a horse-thief, for the crime of freedom. [Applause.] We see it in\r\nChristian statesmen, and Christian newspapers, and Christian pulpits,\r\napplauding _the cowardly act of a low bully_, WHO CRAWLED UPON HIS\r\nVICTIM BEHIND HIS BACK AND DEALT THE DEADLY BLOW. [Sensation and\r\napplause.] We note our political demoralization in the catch-words that\r\nare coming into such common use; on the one hand, "freedom-shriekers,"\r\nand sometimes "freedom-screechers" [Laughter]; and, on the other hand,\r\n"border ruffians," and that fully deserved. And the significance of\r\ncatch-words cannot pass unheeded, for they constitute a sign of the\r\ntimes. Everything in this world "jibes" in with everything else, and all\r\nthe fruits of this Nebraska bill are like the poisoned source from which\r\nthey come. I will not say that we may not sooner or later be compelled\r\nto meet force by force; but the time has not yet come, and if we are\r\ntrue to ourselves, may never come. Do not mistake that the ballot is\r\nstronger than the bullet. Therefore let the legions of slavery use\r\nbullets; but let us wait patiently till November, and fire ballots at\r\nthem in return; and by that peaceful policy, I believe we shall\r\nultimately win. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nIt was by that policy that here in Illinois the early fathers fought the\r\ngood fight and gained the victory. In 1824 the free men of our State,\r\nled by Governor Coles (who was a native of Maryland and President\r\nMadison\'s private secretary), determined that those beautiful groves\r\nshould never re-echo the dirge of one who has no title to himself. By\r\ntheir resolute determination, the winds that sweep across our broad\r\nprairies shall never cool the parched brow, nor shall the unfettered\r\nstreams that bring joy and gladness to our free soil water the tired\r\nfeet, of a _slave_; but so long as those heavenly breezes and sparkling\r\nstreams bless the land, or the groves and their fragrance or their\r\nmemory remain, the humanity to which they minister SHALL BE FOR EVER\r\nFREE! [Great applause.] Palmer, Yates, Williams, Browning, and some more\r\nin this convention came from Kentucky to Illinois (instead of going to\r\nMissouri), not only to better their conditions, but also to get away\r\nfrom slavery. They have said so to me, and it is understood among us\r\nKentuckians that we don\'t like it one bit. Now, can we, mindful of the\r\nblessings of liberty which the early men of Illinois left to us, refuse\r\na like privilege to the free men who seek to plant Freedom\'s banner on\r\nour Western outposts? ["No! No!"] Should we not stand by our neighbours\r\nwho seek to better their conditions in Kansas and Nebraska? ["Yes!\r\nYes!"] Can we as Christian men, and strong and free ourselves, wield the\r\nsledge or hold the iron which is to manacle anew an already oppressed\r\nrace? ["No! No!"] "Woe unto them," it is written, "that decree\r\nunrighteous decrees and that write grievousness which they have\r\nprescribed." Can we afford to sin any more deeply against human liberty?\r\n["No! No!"]\r\n\r\nOne great trouble in the matter is, that slavery is an insidious and\r\ncrafty power, and gains equally by open violence of the brutal as well\r\nas by sly management of the peaceful. Even after the ordinance of 1787,\r\nthe settlers in Indiana and Illinois (it was all one government then)\r\ntried to get Congress to allow slavery temporarily, and petitions to\r\nthat end were sent from Kaskaskia, and General Harrison, the Governor,\r\nurged it from Vincennes the capital. If that had succeeded, good-bye to\r\nliberty here. But John Randolph of Virginia made a vigorous report\r\nagainst it; and although they persevered so well as to get three\r\nfavourable reports for it, yet the United States Senate, with the aid of\r\nsome slave States, finally _squelched_ it for good. [Applause.] And that\r\nis why this hall is to-day a temple for free men instead of a negro\r\nlivery stable. [Great applause and laughter.] Once let slavery get\r\nplanted in a locality, by ever so weak or doubtful a title, and in ever\r\nso small numbers, and it is like the Canada thistle or Bermuda\r\ngrass--you can\'t root it out. You yourself may detest slavery; but your\r\nneighbour has five or six slaves, and he is an excellent neighbour, or\r\nyour son has married his daughter, and they beg you to help save their\r\nproperty, and you vote against your interest and principles to\r\naccommodate a neighbour, hoping that your vote will be on the losing\r\nside. And others do the same; and in those ways slavery gets a sure\r\nfoothold. And when that is done the whole mighty Union--the force of the\r\nnation--is committed to its support. And that very process is working in\r\nKansas to-day. And you must recollect that the slave property is worth a\r\nbillion of dollars ($1,000,000,000); while free-State men must work for\r\nsentiment alone. Then there are "blue lodges"--as they call\r\nthem--everywhere doing their secret and deadly work.\r\n\r\nIt is a very strange thing, and not solvable by any moral law that I\r\nknow of, that if a man loses his horse, the whole country will turn out\r\nto help hang the thief; but if a man but a shade or two darker than I am\r\nis himself stolen, the same crowd will hang one who aids in restoring\r\nhim to liberty. Such are the inconsistencies of slavery, where a horse\r\nis more sacred than a man; and the essence of _squatter_ or popular\r\nsovereignty--I don\'t care how you call it--is that if one man chooses to\r\nmake a slave of another, no third man shall be allowed to object. And if\r\nyou can do this in free Kansas, and it is allowed to stand, the next\r\nthing you will see is ship-loads of negroes from Africa at the wharf at\r\nCharleston; for one thing is as truly lawful as the other; and these\r\nare the bastard notions we have got to stamp out, else they will stamp\r\nus out. [Sensation and applause.]\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, at Springfield, Judge Douglas avowed that Illinois came\r\ninto the Union as a slave State, and that slavery was weeded out by the\r\noperation of his great, patent, everlasting principle of "popular\r\nsovereignty." [Laughter.] Well, now, that argument must be answered, for\r\nit has a little grain of truth at the bottom. I do not mean that it is\r\ntrue in essence, as he would have us believe. It could not be\r\nessentially true if the ordinance of \'87 was valid. But, in point of\r\nfact, there were some degraded beings called slaves in Kaskaskia and the\r\nother French settlements when our first State constitution was adopted;\r\nthat is a fact, and I don\'t deny it. Slaves were brought here as early\r\nas 1720, and were kept here in spite of the ordinance of 1787 against\r\nit. But slavery did not thrive here. On the contrary, under the\r\ninfluence of the ordinance, the number _decreased_ fifty-one from 1810\r\nto 1820; while under the influence of _squatter_ sovereignty, right\r\nacross the river in Missouri, they _increased_ seven thousand two\r\nhundred and eleven in the same time; and slavery finally faded out in\r\nIllinois, under the influence of the law of freedom, while it grew\r\nstronger and stronger in Missouri, under the law or practice of "popular\r\nsovereignty." In point of fact there were but one hundred and seventeen\r\nslaves in Illinois one year after its admission, or one to every four\r\nhundred and seventy of its population; or, to state it in another way,\r\nif Illinois was a slave State in 1820, so were New York and New Jersey\r\nmuch greater slave States from having had greater numbers, slavery\r\nhaving been established there in very early times. But there is this\r\nvital difference between all these States and the judge\'s Kansas\r\nexperiment: that they sought to disestablish slavery which had been\r\nalready established, while the judge seeks, so far as he can, to\r\ndisestablish freedom, which had been established there by the Missouri\r\nCompromise. [Voices: "Good!"]\r\n\r\nThe Union is undergoing a fearful strain; but it is a stout old ship,\r\nand has weathered many a hard blow, and "the stars in their courses,"\r\naye, an invisible power, greater than the puny efforts of men, will\r\nfight for us. But we ourselves must not decline the burden of\r\nresponsibility, nor take counsel of unworthy passions. Whatever duty\r\nurges us to do or to omit, must be done or omitted; and the recklessness\r\nwith which our adversaries break the laws, or counsel their violation,\r\nshould afford no example for us. Therefore, let us revere the\r\nDeclaration of Independence; let us continue to obey the Constitution\r\nand the laws; let us keep step to the music of the Union. Let us draw a\r\ncordon, so to speak, around the slave States, and the hateful\r\ninstitution, like a reptile poisoning itself, will perish by its own\r\ninfamy. [Applause.]\r\n\r\nBut we cannot be free men if this is, by our national choice, to be a\r\nland of slavery. Those who deny freedom to others, deserve it not for\r\nthemselves; and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it.\r\n[Loud applause.]\r\n\r\nDid you ever, my friends, seriously reflect upon the speed with which we\r\nare tending downward? Within the memory of men now present the leading\r\nstatesmen of Virginia could make genuine, red-hot abolitionist speeches\r\nin old Virginia; and, as I have said, now even in "free Kansas" it is a\r\ncrime to declare that it is "free Kansas." The very sentiments that I\r\nand others have just uttered would entitle us, and each of us, to the\r\nignominy and seclusion of a dungeon; and yet I suppose that, like Paul,\r\nwe were "free born." But if this thing is allowed to continue, it will\r\nbe but one step further to impress the same rule in Illinois.\r\n[Sensation.]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of all is, that we must restore the Missouri Compromise.\r\nWe must highly resolve that _Kansas must be free_! [Great applause.] We\r\nmust reinstate the birthday promise of the Republic; we must reaffirm\r\nthe Declaration of Independence; we must make good in essence as well as\r\nin form Madison\'s vowal that "the word _slave_ ought not to appear in\r\nthe Constitution;" and we must even go further, and decree that only\r\nlocal law, and not that time-honoured instrument, shall shelter a\r\nslave-holder. We must make this a land of liberty in fact, as it is in\r\nname. But in seeking to attain these results--so indispensable if the\r\nliberty which is our pride and boast shall endure--we will be loyal to\r\nthe Constitution and to the "flag of our Union," and no matter what our\r\ngrievance--even though Kansas shall come in as a slave State; and no\r\nmatter what theirs--even if we shall restore the Compromise--WE WILL SAY\r\nTO THE SOUTHERN DISUNIONISTS, WE WON\'T GO OUT OF THE UNION, AND YOU\r\nSHAN\'T!!! [This was the climax; the audience rose to its feet _en\r\nmasse_, applauded, stamped, waved handkerchiefs, threw hats in the air,\r\nand ran riot for several minutes. The arch-enchanter who wrought this\r\ntransformation looked, meanwhile, like the personification of political\r\njustice.]\r\n\r\nBut let us, meanwhile, appeal to the sense and patriotism of the people,\r\nand not to their prejudices; let us spread the floods of enthusiasm here\r\naroused all over these vast prairies, so suggestive of freedom. Let us\r\ncommence by electing the gallant soldier Governor (Colonel) Bissell who\r\nstood for the honour of our State alike on the plains and amidst the\r\nchaparral of Mexico and on the floor of Congress, while he defied the\r\nSouthern Hotspur; and that will have a greater moral effect than all the\r\nborder ruffians can accomplish in all their raids on Kansas. There is\r\nboth a power and a magic in popular opinion. To that let us now appeal;\r\nand while, in all probability, no resort to force will be needed, our\r\nmoderation and forbearance will stand us in good stead when, if ever, WE\r\nMUST MAKE AN APPEAL TO BATTLE AND TO THE GOD OF HOSTS!! [Immense\r\napplause and a rush for the orator.]\r\n\r\nThis speech has been called Lincoln\'s "Lost Speech," because all the\r\nreporters present were so carried away by his eloquence that they one\r\nand all forgot to take any notes. If it had not been for a young lawyer,\r\na Mr. H.C. Whitney, who kept his head sufficiently to take notes, we\r\nwould have no record of it. Mr. Whitney wrote out the speech for\r\nMcClure\'s Magazine in 1896. It was submitted to several people who were\r\npresent at the Bloomington Convention, and they said it was remarkably\r\naccurate considering that it was not taken down stenographically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From his Speech on the Dred Scott Decision. Springfield, Illinois. June\r\n26, 1857_\r\n\r\n\r\n... And now as to the Dred Scott decision. That decision declares two\r\npropositions,--first, that a negro cannot sue in the United States\r\ncourts; and secondly, that Congress cannot prohibit slavery in the\r\nTerritories. It was made by a divided court,--dividing differently on\r\nthe different points. Judge Douglas does not discuss the merits of the\r\ndecision, and in that respect I shall follow his example, believing I\r\ncould no more improve on McLean and Curtis than he could on Taney.\r\n\r\nHe denounces all who question the correctness of that decision, as\r\noffering violent resistance to it. But who resists it? Who has, in spite\r\nof the decision, declared Dred Scott free, and resisted the authority of\r\nhis master over him?\r\n\r\nJudicial decisions have two uses: first, to absolutely determine the\r\ncase decided; and secondly, to indicate to the public how other similar\r\ncases will be decided when they arise. For the latter use, they are\r\ncalled "precedents" and "authorities."\r\n\r\nWe believe as much as Judge Douglas (perhaps more) in obedience to and\r\nrespect for the judicial department of government. We think its\r\ndecisions on constitutional questions, when fully settled, should\r\ncontrol not only the particular cases decided, but the general policy of\r\nthe country, subject to be disturbed only by amendments of the\r\nConstitution, as provided in that instrument itself. More than this\r\nwould be revolution. But we think the Dred Scott decision is erroneous.\r\nWe know the court that made it has often overruled its own decisions,\r\nand we shall do what we can to have it overrule this. We offer no\r\nresistance to it.\r\n\r\nJudicial decisions are of greater or less authority as precedents\r\naccording to circumstances. That this should be so, accords both with\r\ncommon-sense and the customary understanding of the legal profession.\r\n\r\nIf this important decision had been made by the unanimous concurrence of\r\nthe judges, and without any apparent partisan bias, and in accordance\r\nwith legal public expectation, and with the steady practice of the\r\ndepartments throughout our history, and had been in no part based on\r\nassumed historical facts, which are not really true; or if wanting in\r\nsome of these, it had been before the court more than once, and had\r\nthere been affirmed and reaffirmed through a course of years,--it then\r\nmight be, perhaps would be factious, nay, even revolutionary, not to\r\nacquiesce in it as a precedent.\r\n\r\nBut when, as is true, we find it wanting in all these claims to the\r\npublic confidence, it is not resistance, it is not factious, it is not\r\neven disrespectful to treat it as not having yet quite established a\r\nsettled doctrine for the country.\r\n\r\nI have said in substance, that the Dred Scott decision was in part based\r\non assumed historical facts which were not really true, and I ought not\r\nto leave the subject without giving some reasons for saying this, I\r\ntherefore give an instance or two, which I think fully sustain me. Chief\r\nJustice Taney, in delivering the opinion of the majority of the court,\r\ninsists at great length that negroes were no part of the people who\r\nmade, or for whom was made, the Declaration of Independence, or the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, Judge Curtis, in his dissenting opinion, shows that in\r\nfive of the then thirteen States--to wit, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nNew York, New Jersey, and North Carolina--free negroes were voters, and\r\nin proportion to their numbers had the same part in making the\r\nConstitution that the white people had. He shows this with so much\r\nparticularity as to leave no doubt of its truth; and as a sort of\r\nconclusion on that point, holds the following language:\r\n\r\n     "The Constitution was ordained and established by the people of the\r\n     United States, through the action, in each State, of those persons\r\n     who were qualified by its laws to act thereon in behalf of\r\n     themselves and all other citizens of the State. In some of the\r\n     States, as we have seen, coloured persons were among those\r\n     qualified by law to act on the subject. These coloured persons were\r\n     not only included in the body of \'the people of the United States\'\r\n     by whom the Constitution was ordained and established; but in at\r\n     least five of the States they had the power to act, and doubtless\r\n     did act, by their suffrages, upon the question of its adoption."\r\n\r\nAgain, Chief Justice Taney says:\r\n\r\n     "It is difficult at this day to realize the state of public\r\n     opinion, in relation to that unfortunate race, which prevailed in\r\n     the civilized and enlightened portions of the world at the time of\r\n     the Declaration of Independence, and when the Constitution of the\r\n     United States was framed and adopted."\r\n\r\nAnd again, after quoting from the Declaration, he says:\r\n\r\n     "The general words above quoted would seem to include the whole\r\n     human family, and if they were used in a similar instrument at this\r\n     day, would be so understood."\r\n\r\nIn these the Chief Justice does not directly assert, but plainly assumes\r\nas a fact, that the public estimate of the black man is more favourable\r\nnow than it was in the days of the Revolution. This assumption is a\r\nmistake. In some trifling particulars the condition of that race has\r\nbeen ameliorated; but as a whole, in this country, the change between\r\nthen and now is decidedly the other way; and their ultimate destiny has\r\nnever appeared so hopeless as in the last three or four years. In two\r\nof the five States--New Jersey and North Carolina--that then gave the\r\nfree negro the right of voting, the right has since been taken away; and\r\nin a third--New York--it has been greatly abridged: while it has not\r\nbeen extended, so far as I know, to a single additional State, though\r\nthe number of the States has more than doubled. In those days, as I\r\nunderstand, masters could, at their own pleasure, emancipate their\r\nslaves; but since then such legal restraints have been made upon\r\nemancipation as to amount almost to prohibition. In those days\r\nlegislatures held the unquestioned power to abolish slavery in their\r\nrespective States; but now it is becoming quite fashionable for State\r\nconstitutions to withhold that power from the legislatures. In those\r\ndays, by common consent, the spread of the black man\'s bondage to the\r\nnew countries was prohibited; but now Congress decides that it will not\r\ncontinue the prohibition, and the Supreme Court decides that it could\r\nnot if it would. In those days our Declaration of Independence was held\r\nsacred by all, and thought to include all; but now, to aid in making the\r\nbondage of the negro universal and eternal, it is assailed and sneered\r\nat, and construed, and hawked at, and torn, till, if its framers could\r\nrise from their graves, they could not at all recognize it. All the\r\npowers of earth seem rapidly combining against him. Mammon is after him;\r\nambition follows, philosophy follows, and the theology of the day is\r\nfast joining in the cry. They have him in his prison-house; they have\r\nsearched his person, and left no prying instrument with him. One after\r\nanother they have closed the heavy iron doors upon him; and now they\r\nhave him, as it were, bolted in with a lock of a hundred keys, which can\r\nnever be unlocked without the concurrence of every key; the keys in the\r\nhands of a hundred different men, and they scattered to a hundred\r\ndifferent and distant places; and they stand musing as to what\r\ninvention, in all the dominions of mind and matter, can be produced to\r\nmake the impossibility of escape more complete than it is. It is\r\ngrossly incorrect to say or assume that the public estimate of the negro\r\nis more favourable now than it was at the origin of the government.\r\n\r\n... There is a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all white people\r\nat the idea of an indiscriminate amalgamation of the white and black\r\nraces; and Judge Douglas evidently is basing his chief hope upon the\r\nchances of his being able to appropriate the benefit of this disgust to\r\nhimself. If he can, by much drumming and repeating, fasten the odium of\r\nthat idea upon his adversaries, he thinks he can struggle through the\r\nstorm. He therefore clings to this hope as a drowning man to the last\r\nplank. He makes an occasion for lugging it in from the opposition to the\r\nDred Scott decision. He finds the Republicans insisting that the\r\nDeclaration of Independence includes _all_ men, black as well as white;\r\nand forthwith he boldly denies that it includes negroes at all, and\r\nproceeds to argue gravely that all who contend it does, do so only\r\nbecause they want to vote, and eat, and sleep, and marry with negroes!\r\nHe will have it that they cannot be consistent else. Now I protest\r\nagainst the counterfeit logic which concludes that because I do not want\r\na black woman for a slave, I must necessarily want her for a wife. I\r\nneed not have her for either. I can just leave her alone. In some\r\nrespects she certainly is not my equal; but in her natural right to eat\r\nthe bread she earns with her own hands without asking leave of any one\r\nelse, she is my equal, and the equal of all others.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Taney, in his opinion in the Dred Scott case, admits that\r\nthe language of the Declaration is broad enough to include the whole\r\nhuman family; but he and Judge Douglas argue that the authors of that\r\ninstrument did not intend to include negroes, by the fact that they did\r\nnot at once actually place them on an equality with the whites. Now this\r\ngrave argument comes to just nothing at all, by the other fact that they\r\ndid not at once, nor ever afterward, actually place all white people on\r\nan equality with one another. And this is the staple argument of both\r\nthe Chief Justice and the senator, for doing this obvious violence to\r\nthe plain, unmistakable language of the Declaration.\r\n\r\nI think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include _all_\r\nmen, but they did not intend to declare all men equal _in all respects_.\r\nThey did not mean to say that all were equal in colour, size, intellect,\r\nmoral developments, or social capacity. They defined with tolerable\r\ndistinctness in what respects they did consider all men created\r\nequal,--equal with "certain inalienable rights, among which are life,\r\nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness." This they said, and this they\r\nmeant. They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were\r\nthen actually enjoying that equality, nor yet that they were about to\r\nconfer it immediately upon them. In fact, they had no power to confer\r\nsuch a boon. They meant simply to declare the right, so that the\r\nenforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit.\r\n\r\nThey meant to set up a standard maxim for free society, which should be\r\nfamiliar to all and revered by all,--constantly looked to, constantly\r\nlaboured for, and, even though never perfectly attained, constantly\r\napproximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its\r\ninfluence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people\r\nof all colours everywhere. The assertion that "all men are created\r\nequal," was of no practical use in effecting our separation from Great\r\nBritain; and it was placed in the Declaration, not for that, but for\r\nfuture use. Its authors meant it to be as, thank God, it is now proving\r\nitself, a stumbling-block to all those who in after times might seek to\r\nturn a free people back into the hateful paths of despotism. They knew\r\nthe proneness of prosperity to breed tyrants, and they meant, when such\r\nshould reappear in this fair land and commence their vocation, that they\r\nshould find left for them at least one hard nut to crack.\r\n\r\nI have now briefly expressed my view of the meaning and object of that\r\npart of the Declaration of Independence which declares that all men are\r\ncreated equal. Now let us hear Judge Douglas\'s view of the same\r\nsubject, as I find it in the printed report of his late speech. Here it\r\nis:\r\n\r\n     "No man can vindicate the character, motives and conduct of the\r\n     signers of the Declaration of Independence except upon the\r\n     hypothesis that they referred to the white race alone, and not to\r\n     the African, when they declared all men to have been created equal;\r\n     that they were speaking of British subjects on this continent being\r\n     equal to British subjects born and residing in Great Britain; that\r\n     they were entitled to the same inalienable rights, and among them\r\n     were enumerated life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The\r\n     Declaration was adopted for the purpose of justifying the colonists\r\n     in the eyes of the civilized world in withdrawing their allegiance\r\n     from the British crown, and dissolving their connection with the\r\n     mother-country."\r\n\r\nMy good friends, read that carefully over some leisure hour, and ponder\r\nwell upon it; see what a mere wreck and mangled ruin Judge Douglas makes\r\nof our once glorious Declaration. He says "they were speaking of British\r\nsubjects on this continent being equal to British subjects born and\r\nresiding in Great Britain!" Why, according to this, not only negroes but\r\nwhite people outside of Great Britain and America were not spoken of in\r\nthat instrument. The English, Irish, and Scotch, along with white\r\nAmericans, were included, to be sure; but the French, Germans, and other\r\nwhite people of the world are all gone to pot along with the Judge\'s\r\ninferior races!\r\n\r\nI had thought that the Declaration promised something better than the\r\ncondition of British subjects; but no, it only meant that we should be\r\nequal to them in their own oppressed and unequal condition. According to\r\nthat, it gave no promise that, having kicked off the king and lords of\r\nGreat Britain, we should not at once be saddled with a king and lords of\r\nour own.\r\n\r\nI had thought the Declaration contemplated the progressive improvement\r\nin the condition of all men, everywhere; but no, it merely "was adopted\r\nfor the purpose of justifying the colonists in the eyes of the\r\ncivilized world in withdrawing their allegiance from the British crown,\r\nand dissolving their connection with the mother-country." Why, that\r\nobject having been effected some eighty years ago, the Declaration is of\r\nno practical use now--mere rubbish--old wadding, left to rot on the\r\nbattle-field after the victory is won.\r\n\r\nI understand you are preparing to celebrate the "Fourth," to-morrow\r\nweek. What for? The doings of that day had no reference to the present;\r\nand quite half of you are not even descendants of those who were\r\nreferred to at that day. But I suppose you will celebrate, and will even\r\ngo so far as to read the Declaration. Suppose, after you read it once in\r\nthe old-fashioned way, you read it once more with Judge Douglas\'s\r\nversion. It will then run thus: "We told these truths to be\r\nself-evident, that all British subjects who were on this continent\r\neighty-one years ago, were created equal to all British subjects born\r\nand then residing in Great Britain!"\r\n\r\n... The very Dred Scott case affords a strong test as to which party\r\nmost favours amalgamation, the Republicans or the dear Union-saving\r\nDemocracy. Dred Scott, his wife and two daughters, were all involved in\r\nthe suit. We desired the court to have held that they were citizens, so\r\nfar at least as to entitle them to a hearing as to whether they were\r\nfree or not; and then also, that they were in fact and in law really\r\nfree. Could we have had our way, the chances of these black girls ever\r\nmixing their blood with that of white people would have been diminished\r\nat least to the extent that it could not have been without their\r\nconsent. But Judge Douglas is delighted to have them decided to be\r\nslaves, and not human enough to have a hearing, even if they were free,\r\nand thus left subject to the forced concubinage of their masters, and\r\nliable to become the mothers of mulattoes in spite of themselves,--the\r\nvery state of the case that produces nine-tenths of all the mulattoes,\r\nall the mixing of the blood of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_"A house divided against itself cannot stand." On Lincoln\'s Nomination\r\nto the United States Senate. Springfield, Illinois. June 17, 1858_\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we could first know where we are, and whither we are tending, we\r\ncould better judge what to do, and how to do it. We are now far into the\r\nfifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and\r\nconfident promise of putting an end to slavery agitation. Under the\r\noperation of that policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but\r\nhas constantly augmented. In my opinion it will not cease until a crisis\r\nshall have been reached and passed. "A house divided against itself\r\ncannot stand." I believe this government cannot endure permanently, half\r\nslave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved,--I do\r\nnot expect the house to fall; but I do expect it will cease to be\r\ndivided. It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either the\r\nopponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it\r\nwhere the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course\r\nof ultimate extinction; or its advocates will push it forward till it\r\nshall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North\r\nas well as South.\r\n\r\nHave we no tendency to the latter condition? Let any one who doubts,\r\ncarefully contemplate that now almost complete legal combination--piece\r\nof machinery, so to speak--compounded of the Nebraska doctrine and the\r\nDred Scott decision. Let him consider not only what work the machinery\r\nis adapted to do, and how well adapted; but also let him study the\r\nhistory of its construction, and trace, if he can, or rather fail, if he\r\ncan, to trace the evidences of design and concert of action among its\r\nchief architects from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe new year of 1854 found slavery excluded from more than half the\r\nStates by State constitutions, and from most of the national territory\r\nby congressional prohibition. Four days later commenced the struggle\r\nwhich ended in repealing that congressional prohibition. This opened all\r\nthe national territory to slavery, and was the first point gained.\r\n\r\nBut so far, Congress only had acted; and an indorsement by the people,\r\nreal or apparent, was indispensable to save the point already gained and\r\ngive chance for more.\r\n\r\nThis necessity had not been overlooked, but had been provided for, as\r\nwell as might be, in the notable argument of _Squatter Sovereignty_,\r\notherwise called _sacred right of self-government_, which latter phrase,\r\nthough expressive of the only rightful basis of any government, was so\r\nperverted in this attempted use of it, as to amount to just this: That\r\nif any one man choose to enslave another, no third man shall be allowed\r\nto object. That argument was incorporated into the Nebraska bill itself,\r\nin the language which follows: "It being the true intent and meaning of\r\nthis act, not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to\r\nexclude it therefrom; but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to\r\nform and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject\r\nonly to the Constitution of the United States." Then opened the roar of\r\nloose declamation in favour of _Squatter Sovereignty_ and _sacred right\r\nof self-government_. "But," said opposition members, "let us amend the\r\nbill so as to expressly declare that the people of the Territory may\r\nexclude slavery." "Not we," said the friends of the measure, and down\r\nthey voted the amendment.\r\n\r\nWhile the Nebraska bill was passing through Congress, a _law case_,\r\ninvolving the question of a negro\'s freedom, by reason of his owner\r\nhaving voluntarily taken him first into a free State and then into a\r\nTerritory covered by the congressional prohibition, and held him as a\r\nslave for a long time in each, was passing through the United States\r\nCircuit Court for the District of Missouri; and both Nebraska bill and\r\nlaw-suit were brought to a decision, in the same month of May, 1854. The\r\nnegro\'s name was "Dred Scott," which name now designates the decision\r\nfinally rendered in the case. Before the then next presidential\r\nelection, the law case came to, and was argued, in the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States; but the decision of it was deferred until after the\r\nelection. Still, before the election, Senator Trumbull, on the floor of\r\nthe Senate, requested the leading advocate of the Nebraska bill to state\r\n_his opinion_ whether the people of a Territory can constitutionally\r\nexclude slavery from their limits, and the latter answers: "That is a\r\nquestion for the Supreme Court."\r\n\r\nThe election came. Mr. Buchanan was elected, and the indorsement, such\r\nas it was, secured. That was the second point gained. The indorsement,\r\nhowever, fell short of a clear popular majority by nearly four hundred\r\nthousand votes, and so, perhaps, was not overwhelmingly reliable and\r\nsatisfactory. The outgoing President, in his last annual message, as\r\nimpressively as possible echoed back upon the people the weight and\r\nauthority of the indorsement. The Supreme Court met again; did not\r\nannounce their decision, but ordered a reargument. The presidential\r\ninauguration came, and still no decision of the Court; but the incoming\r\nPresident in his inaugural address fervently exhorted the people to\r\nabide by the forthcoming decision, whatever it might be. Then, in a few\r\ndays, came the decision.\r\n\r\nThe reputed author of the Nebraska bill finds an early occasion to make\r\na speech at this capitol, indorsing the Dred Scott decision, and\r\nvehemently denouncing all opposition to it. The new President, too,\r\nseizes the early occasion of the Silliman letter to indorse and strongly\r\nconstrue that decision, and to express his astonishment that any\r\ndifferent view had ever been entertained!\r\n\r\nAt length a squabble springs up between the President and the author of\r\nthe Nebraska bill, on the mere question of _fact_ whether the Lecompton\r\nconstitution was, or was not, in any just sense, made by the people of\r\nKansas; and in that quarrel, the latter declares that all he wants is a\r\nfair vote for the people, and that he cares not whether slavery be voted\r\n_down_ or _voted up_. I do not understand his declaration that he cares\r\nnot whether slavery be voted down or voted up, to be intended by him\r\nother than as an apt definition of the policy he would impress upon the\r\npublic mind,--the principle for which he declares he has suffered so\r\nmuch, and is ready to suffer to the end. And well may he cling to that\r\nprinciple. If he has any parental feeling, well may he cling to it. That\r\nprinciple is the only shred left of his original Nebraska doctrine.\r\nUnder the Dred Scott decision, "squatter sovereignty" squatted out of\r\nexistence, tumbled down like temporary scaffolding; like the mould at\r\nthe foundry, it served through one blast, and fell back into loose\r\nsand,--helped to carry an election, and then was kicked to the winds.\r\nHis late joint struggle with the Republicans against the Lecompton\r\nconstitution, involves nothing of the original Nebraska doctrine. That\r\nstruggle was made on a point--the right of the people to make their own\r\nconstitution--upon which he and the Republicans have never differed.\r\n\r\nThe several points of the Dred Scott decision in connection with Senator\r\nDouglas\'s "care not" policy, constitute the piece of machinery in its\r\npresent state of advancement. This was the third point gained. The\r\nworking points of that machinery are:\r\n\r\n_First._ That no negro slave, imported as such from Africa, and no\r\ndescendant of such slave, can ever be a citizen of any State, in the\r\nsense of that term as used in the Constitution of the United States.\r\nThis point is made in order to deprive the negro, in every possible\r\nevent, of the benefit of that provision of the United States\r\nConstitution which declares that "citizens of each State shall be\r\nentitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several\r\nStates."\r\n\r\n_Secondly._ That "subject to the Constitution of the United States,"\r\nneither Congress nor a territorial legislature can exclude slavery from\r\nany United States Territory. This point is made in order that individual\r\nmen may fill up the Territories with slaves, without danger of losing\r\nthem as property, and thus enhance the chances of permanency to the\r\ninstitution through all the future.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly._ That whether the holding a negro in actual slavery in a free\r\nState makes him free as against the holder, the United States Courts\r\nwill not decide, but will leave to be decided by the courts of any slave\r\nState the negro may be forced into by the master. This point is made,\r\nnot to be pressed immediately; but if acquiesced in for a while, and\r\napparently indorsed by the people at an election, then to sustain the\r\nlogical conclusion that what Dred Scott\'s master might lawfully do with\r\nDred Scott in the free State of Illinois, every other master may\r\nlawfully do, with any other one, or one thousand slaves in Illinois, or\r\nin any other free State.\r\n\r\nAuxiliary to all this, and working hand-in-hand with it, the Nebraska\r\ndoctrine, or what is left of it, is to educate and mould public opinion\r\nnot to care whether slavery is voted down or voted up. This shows\r\nexactly where we now are, and partially, also, whither we are tending.\r\n\r\nIt will throw additional light on the latter, to go back, and run the\r\nmind over the string of historical facts already stated. Several things\r\nwill now appear less dark and mysterious than they did when they were\r\ntranspiring. The people were to be left "perfectly free," "subject only\r\nto the Constitution." What the Constitution had to do with it, outsiders\r\ncould not then see. Plainly enough now: it was an exactly fitted niche\r\nfor the Dred Scott decision to afterwards come in, and declare the\r\nperfect freedom of the people to be just no freedom at all. Why was the\r\namendment expressly declaring the right of the people voted down?\r\nPlainly enough now: the adoption of it would have spoiled the niche for\r\nthe Dred Scott decision. Why was the Court decision held up? Why even a\r\nSenator\'s individual opinion withheld till after the presidential\r\nelection? Plainly enough now: the speaking out then would have damaged\r\nthe perfectly free argument upon which the election was to be carried.\r\nWhy the outgoing President\'s felicitation on the indorsement? Why the\r\ndelay of a reargument? Why the incoming President\'s advance exhortation\r\nin favour of the decision? These things look like the cautious patting\r\nand petting of a spirited horse, preparatory to mounting him, when it is\r\ndreaded that he may give the rider a fall. And why the hasty\r\nafter-indorsement of the decision by the President and others?\r\n\r\nWe cannot absolutely know that all these adaptations are the result of\r\npreconcert. But when we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions\r\nof which we know have been gotten out at different times and places, and\r\nby different workmen--Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James, for instance\r\n(Douglas, Pierce, Taney, Buchanan),--and when we see those timbers\r\njoined together, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a\r\nmill, all the tenons and mortices exactly fitting, and all the lengths\r\nand proportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their\r\nrespective places, and not a piece too many or too few, not omitting\r\neven scaffolding--or if a single piece be lacking, we see the place in\r\nthe frame exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece in,--in\r\nsuch a case, we find it impossible not to believe that Stephen and\r\nFranklin and Roger and James all understood one another from the\r\nbeginning, and all worked upon a common plan or draft, drawn up before\r\nthe first blow was struck.\r\n\r\nIt should not be overlooked that by the Nebraska bill the people of a\r\nState as well as Territory were to be left "perfectly free," "subject\r\nonly to the Constitution." Why mention a State? They were legislating\r\nfor Territories, and not for or about States. Certainly the people of a\r\nState are and ought to be subject to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates; but why is mention of this lugged into this merely territorial\r\nlaw? Why are the people of a Territory and the people of a State therein\r\nlumped together, and their relation to the Constitution therein treated\r\nas being precisely the same? While the opinion of the Court by Chief\r\nJustice Taney, in the Dred Scott case, and the separate opinions of all\r\nthe concurring judges, expressly declare that the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States neither permits Congress nor a territorial legislature to\r\nexclude slavery from any United States Territory, they all omit to\r\ndeclare whether or not the same Constitution permits a State or the\r\npeople of a State to exclude it. _Possibly_ this is a mere omission; but\r\nwho can be quite sure if McLean or Curtis had sought to get into the\r\nopinion a declaration of unlimited power in the people of a State to\r\nexclude slavery from their limits,--just as Chase and Mace sought to get\r\nsuch declaration in behalf of the people of a Territory, into the\r\nNebraska Bill,--I ask, who can be quite sure that it would not have been\r\nvoted down in the one case as it had been in the other? The nearest\r\napproach to the point of declaring the power of a State over slavery is\r\nmade by Judge Nelson. He approaches it more than once, using the precise\r\nidea, and almost the language too, of the Nebraska act. On one occasion\r\nhis exact language is "except in cases where the power is restrained by\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, the law of the State is supreme\r\nover the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction." In what cases the\r\npower of the State is so restrained by the United States Constitution is\r\nleft an open question, precisely as the same question, as to the\r\nrestraint on the power of the Territories, was left open in the Nebraska\r\nact. Put this and that together, and we have another nice little niche,\r\nwhich we may, ere long, see filled with another Supreme Court decision,\r\ndeclaring that the Constitution of the United States does not permit _a\r\nState_ to exclude slavery from its limits. And this may especially be\r\nexpected if the doctrine of "care not whether slavery be voted down or\r\nvoted up" shall gain upon the public mind sufficiently to give promise\r\nthat such a decision can be maintained when made.\r\n\r\nSuch a decision is all that slavery now lacks of being alike lawful in\r\nall the States. Welcome or unwelcome, such decision is probably coming,\r\nand will soon be upon us, unless the power of the present political\r\ndynasty shall be met and overthrown. We shall lie down, pleasantly\r\ndreaming that the people of Missouri are on the verge of making their\r\nState free, and we shall awake to the reality instead, that the Supreme\r\nCourt has made Illinois a slave State. To meet and overthrow the power\r\nof that dynasty is the work now before all those who would prevent that\r\nconsummation. That is what we have to do. How can we best do it?\r\n\r\nThere are those who denounce us openly to their own friends, and yet\r\nwhisper to us softly that Senator Douglas is the aptest instrument there\r\nis with which to effect that object. They wish us to _infer_ all from\r\nthe fact that he now has a little quarrel with the present head of that\r\ndynasty, and that he has regularly voted with us on a single point, upon\r\nwhich he and we have never differed. They remind us that he is a great\r\nman and that the largest of us are very small ones. Let this be granted.\r\nBut "a living dog is better than a dead lion." Judge Douglas, if not a\r\ndead lion, for this work is at least a caged and toothless one. How can\r\nhe oppose the advances of slavery? He don\'t care anything about it. His\r\navowed mission is impressing the "public heart" to _care nothing about\r\nit_. A leading Douglas Democratic newspaper thinks Douglas\'s superior\r\ntalent will be needed to resist the revival of the African slave-trade.\r\nDoes Douglas believe an effort to revive that trade is approaching? He\r\nhas not said so. Does he really think so? But if it is, how can he\r\nresist it? For years he has laboured to prove it a sacred right of white\r\nmen to take negro slaves into the new territories. Can he possibly show\r\nthat it is a less sacred right to buy them where they can be bought\r\ncheapest? And unquestionably they can be bought cheaper in Africa than\r\nin Virginia. He has done all in his power to reduce the whole question\r\nof slavery to one of a mere right of property: and, as such, how can he\r\noppose the foreign slave-trade?--how can he refuse that trade in that\r\nproperty shall be "perfectly free," unless he does it as a protection to\r\nhome production? And as the home producers will probably not ask the\r\nprotection, he will be wholly without a ground of opposition.\r\n\r\nSenator Douglas holds, we know, that a man may rightfully be wiser\r\nto-day than he was yesterday--that he may rightfully change when he\r\nfinds himself wrong. But can we, for that reason, run ahead, and infer\r\nthat he will make any particular change, of which he himself has given\r\nno intimation? Can we safely base our action upon any such vague\r\ninference?\r\n\r\nNow, as ever, I wish not to misrepresent Judge Douglas\'s position,\r\nquestion his motives, or do aught that can be personally offensive to\r\nhim. Whenever, if ever, he and we can come together on principle, so\r\nthat our cause may have assistance from his great ability, I hope to\r\nhave interposed no adventitious obstacle. But, clearly, he is not now\r\nwith us--he does not pretend to be--he does not promise ever to be.\r\n\r\nOur cause, then, must be intrusted to, and conducted by, its own\r\nundoubted friends--those whose hands are free, whose hearts are in the\r\nwork, who do care for the result. Two years ago the Republicans of the\r\nnation mustered over thirteen hundred thousand strong. We did this under\r\nthe single impulse of resistance to a common danger, with every external\r\ncircumstance against us. Of strange, discordant, and even hostile\r\nelements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought the\r\nbattle through, under the constant hot fire of a disciplined, proud, and\r\npampered enemy. Did we brave all then to falter now?--now, when that\r\nsame enemy is wavering, dissevered, and belligerent? The result is not\r\ndoubtful. We shall not fail. If we stand firm, we shall not fail. Wise\r\ncounsels may accelerate or mistakes delay it; but sooner or later the\r\nvictory is sure to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lincoln\'s Reply to Judge Douglas at Chicago on Popular Sovereignty, the\r\nNebraska Bill, etc. July 10, 1858_\r\n\r\n\r\n... Popular sovereignty! everlasting popular sovereignty! Let us for a\r\nmoment inquire into this vast matter of popular sovereignty. What is\r\npopular sovereignty? We recollect that at an early period in the history\r\nof this struggle, there was another name for the same thing,--_squatter\r\nsovereignty_. It was not exactly popular sovereignty, but squatter\r\nsovereignty. What do these terms mean? What do those terms mean when\r\nused now? And vast credit is taken by our friend, the Judge, in regard\r\nto his support of it, when he declares the last years of his life have\r\nbeen, and all the future years of his life shall be, devoted to this\r\nmatter of popular sovereignty. What is it? Why, it is the sovereignty of\r\nthe people! What was squatter sovereignty? I suppose, if it had any\r\nsignification at all, it was the right of the people to govern\r\nthemselves, to be sovereign in their own affairs, while they were\r\nsquatted down in a country not their own,--while they had squatted on a\r\nterritory that did not belong to them, in the sense that a State belongs\r\nto the people who inhabit it,--when it belonged to the nation; such\r\nright to govern themselves was called "squatter sovereignty."\r\n\r\nNow, I wish you to mark, What has become of that squatter sovereignty?\r\nWhat has become of it? Can you get anybody to tell you now that the\r\npeople of a Territory have any authority to govern themselves, in regard\r\nto this mooted question of slavery, before they form a State\r\nconstitution? No such thing at all, although there is a general running\r\nfire, and although there has been a hurrah made in every speech on that\r\nside, assuming that policy had given to the people of a Territory the\r\nright to govern themselves upon this question; yet the point is dodged.\r\nTo-day it has been decided--no more than a year ago it was decided by\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States, and is insisted upon\r\nto-day--that the people of a Territory have no right to exclude slavery\r\nfrom a Territory; that if any one man chooses to take slaves into a\r\nTerritory, all the rest of the people have no right to keep them out.\r\nThis being so, and this decision being made, one of the points that the\r\nJudge approved, and one in the approval of which he says he means to\r\nkeep me down,--_put_ me down I should not say, for I have never been up!\r\nHe says he is in favour of it, and sticks to it, and expects to win his\r\nbattle on that decision, which says that there is no such thing as\r\nsquatter sovereignty, but that any one man may take slaves into a\r\nTerritory, and all the other men in the Territory may be opposed to it,\r\nand yet by reason of the Constitution they cannot prohibit it. When that\r\nis so, how much is left of this vast matter of squatter sovereignty, I\r\nshould like to know?\r\n\r\nWhen we get back, we get to the point of the right of the people to make\r\na constitution. Kansas was settled, for example, in 1854. It was a\r\nTerritory yet, without having formed a constitution, in a very regular\r\nway, for three years. All this time negro slavery could be taken in by\r\nany few individuals, and by that decision of the Supreme Court, which\r\nthe Judge approves, all the rest of the people cannot keep it out; but\r\nwhen they come to make a constitution they may say they will not have\r\nslavery. But it is there; they are obliged to tolerate it in some way,\r\nand all experience shows it will be so,--for they will not take the\r\nnegro slaves and absolutely deprive the owners of them. All experience\r\nshows this to be so. All that space of time that runs from the beginning\r\nof the settlement of the Territory until there is a sufficiency of\r\npeople to make a State constitution,--all that portion of time popular\r\nsovereignty is given up. The seal is absolutely put down upon it by the\r\ncourt decision, and Judge Douglas puts his own upon the top of that; yet\r\nhe is appealing to the people to give him vast credit for his devotion\r\nto popular sovereignty.\r\n\r\nAgain, when we get to the question of the right of the people to form a\r\nState constitution as they please, to form it with slavery or without\r\nslavery,--if that is anything new I confess I don\'t know it. Has there\r\never been a time when anybody said that any other than the people of a\r\nTerritory itself should form a constitution? What is now in it that\r\nJudge Douglas should have fought several years of his life, and pledge\r\nhimself to fight all the remaining years of his life for? Can Judge\r\nDouglas find anybody on earth that said that anybody else should form a\r\nconstitution for a people?... It is enough for my purpose to ask,\r\nwhenever a Republican said anything against it? They never said anything\r\nagainst it, but they have constantly spoken for it; and whosoever will\r\nundertake to examine the platform and the speeches of responsible men of\r\nthe party, and of irresponsible men, too, if you please, will be unable\r\nto find one word from anybody in the Republican ranks opposed to that\r\npopular sovereignty which Judge Douglas thinks he has invented. I\r\nsuppose that Judge Douglas will claim in a little while that he is the\r\ninventor of the idea that the people should govern themselves; that\r\nnobody ever thought of such a thing until he brought it forward. We do\r\nnot remember that in that old Declaration of Independence it is said\r\nthat "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created\r\nequal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable\r\nrights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among\r\nmen, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." There\r\nis the origin of popular sovereignty. Who, then, shall come in at this\r\nday and claim that he invented it? The Lecompton constitution connects\r\nitself with this question, for it is in this matter of the Lecompton\r\nconstitution that our friend Judge Douglas claims such vast credit. I\r\nagree that in opposing the Lecompton constitution, so far as I can\r\nperceive, he was right. I do not deny that at all; and, gentlemen, you\r\nwill readily see why I could not deny it, even if I wanted to. But I do\r\nnot wish to, for all the Republicans in the nation opposed it, and they\r\nwould have opposed it just as much without Judge Douglas\'s aid as with\r\nit. They had all taken ground against it long before he did. Why, the\r\nreason that he urges against that constitution I urged against him a\r\nyear before. I have the printed speech in my hand. The argument that he\r\nmakes why that constitution should not be adopted, that the people were\r\nnot fairly represented nor allowed to vote, I pointed out in a speech a\r\nyear ago, which I hold in my hand now, that no fair chance was to be\r\ngiven to the people.\r\n\r\n... A little more now as to this matter of popular sovereignty and the\r\nLecompton constitution. The Lecompton constitution, as the Judge tells\r\nus, was defeated. The defeat of it was a good thing, or it was not. He\r\nthinks the defeat of it was a good thing, and so do I; and we agree in\r\nthat. Who defeated it? [A voice: "Judge Douglas."] Yes, he furnished\r\nhimself; and if you suppose he controlled the other Democrats that went\r\nwith him, he furnished three votes, while the Republicans furnished\r\ntwenty.\r\n\r\nThat is what he did to defeat it. In the House of Representatives he and\r\nhis friends furnished some twenty votes, and the Republicans furnished\r\nninety odd. Now, who was it that did the work? [A voice: "Douglas."]\r\nWhy, yes, Douglas did it? To be sure he did!\r\n\r\nLet us, however, put that proposition another way. The Republicans could\r\nnot have done it without Judge Douglas. Could he have done it without\r\nthem? Which could have come the nearest to doing it without the other?\r\nGround was taken against it by the Republicans long before Douglas did\r\nit. The proposition of opposition to that measure is about five to one.\r\n[A voice: "Why don\'t they come out on it?"] You don\'t know what you are\r\ntalking about, my friend; I am quite willing to answer any gentleman in\r\nthe crowd who asks an intelligent question.\r\n\r\nNow, who in all this country has ever found any of our friends of Judge\r\nDouglas\'s way of thinking, and who have acted upon this main question,\r\nthat have ever thought of uttering a word in behalf of Judge Trumbull? I\r\ndefy you to show a printed resolution passed in a Democratic meeting. I\r\ntake it upon myself to defy any man to show a printed resolution, large\r\nor small, of a Democratic meeting in favour of Judge Trumbull, or any of\r\nthe five to one Republicans who beat that bill. Everything must be for\r\nthe Democrats! They did everything, and the five to the one that really\r\ndid the thing, they snub over, and they do not seem to remember that\r\nthey have an existence upon the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I fear that I shall become tedious. I leave this branch of\r\nthe subject to take hold of another. I take up that part of Judge\r\nDouglas\'s speech in which he respectfully attended to me.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas made two points upon my recent speech at Springfield. He\r\nsays they are to be the issues of this campaign. The first one of these\r\npoints he bases upon the language in a speech which I delivered at\r\nSpringfield, which I believe I can quote correctly from memory. I said\r\nthat "we are now far into the fifth year since a policy was instituted\r\nfor the avowed object and with the confident promise of putting an end\r\nto slavery agitation; under the operation of that policy, that agitation\r\nhas not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented. I believe it will\r\nnot cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. \'A house\r\ndivided against itself cannot stand.\' I believe this government cannot\r\nendure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union\r\nto be dissolved,"--I am quoting from my speech,--"I do not expect the\r\nhouse to fall, but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will\r\nbecome all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery\r\nwill arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind\r\nshall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate\r\nextinction, or its advocates will push it forward until it shall become\r\nalike lawful in all the States, old as well as new; North as well as\r\nSouth."\r\n\r\nThat is the paragraph! In this paragraph which I have quoted in your\r\nhearing, and to which I ask the attention of all, Judge Douglas thinks\r\nhe discovers great political heresy. I want your attention particularly\r\nto what he has inferred from it. He says I am in favour of making all\r\nthe States of this Union uniform in all their internal regulations; that\r\nin all their domestic concerns I am in favour of making them entirely\r\nuniform. He draws this inference from the language I have quoted to you.\r\nHe says that I am in favour of making war by the North upon the South\r\nfor the extinction of slavery; that I am also in favour of inviting (as\r\nhe expresses it) the South to a war upon the North for the purpose of\r\nnationalizing slavery. Now, it is singular enough, if you will carefully\r\nread that passage over, that I did not say that I was in favour of\r\nanything in it. I only said what I expected would take place. I made a\r\nprediction only,--it may have been a foolish one, perhaps. I did not\r\neven say that I desired that slavery should be put in course of ultimate\r\nextinction. I do say so now, however; so there need be no longer any\r\ndifficulty about that. It may be written down in the great speech.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, Judge Douglas informed you that this speech of mine was\r\nprobably carefully prepared. I admit that it was. I am not master of\r\nlanguage; I have not a fine education; I am not capable of entering into\r\na disquisition upon dialectics, as I believe you call it; but I do not\r\nbelieve the language I employed bears any such construction as Judge\r\nDouglas puts upon it. But I don\'t care about a quibble in regard to\r\nwords. I know what I meant, and I will not leave this crowd in doubt, if\r\nI can explain it to them, what I really meant in the use of that\r\nparagraph.\r\n\r\nI am not, in the first place, unaware that this government has endured\r\neighty-two years, half slave and half free. I know that. I am tolerably\r\nwell acquainted with the history of the country, and I know that it has\r\nendured eighty-two years, half slave and half free. I believe--and that\r\nis what I meant to allude to there--I believe it has endured, because,\r\nduring all that time, until the introduction of the Nebraska bill, the\r\npublic mind did rest all the time in the belief that slavery was in\r\ncourse of ultimate extinction. That was what gave us the rest that we\r\nhad through that period of eighty-two years; at least, so I believe. I\r\nhave always hated slavery, I think, as much as any Abolitionist,--I\r\nhave been an old-line Whig,--I have always hated it, but I have always\r\nbeen quiet about it until this new era of the introduction of the\r\nNebraska bill began. I always believed that everybody was against it,\r\nand that it was in course of ultimate extinction.... They had reason so\r\nto believe.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the Constitution and its attendant history led the\r\npeople to believe so, and that such was the belief of the framers of the\r\nConstitution itself. Why did those old men, about the time of the\r\nadoption of the Constitution, decree that slavery should not go into the\r\nnew Territory where it had not already gone? Why declare that within\r\ntwenty years the African slave-trade, by which slaves are supplied,\r\nmight be cut off by Congress? Why were all these acts? I might enumerate\r\nmore of these acts; but enough. What were they but a clear indication\r\nthat the framers of the Constitution intended and expected the ultimate\r\nextinction of that institution? And now when I say,--as I said in my\r\nspeech that Judge Douglas has quoted from,--when I say that I think the\r\nopponents of slavery will resist the further spread of it, and place it\r\nwhere the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course\r\nof ultimate extinction, I only mean to say that they will place it where\r\nthe founders of this government originally placed it.\r\n\r\nI have said a hundred times, and I have now no inclination to take it\r\nback, that I believe there is no right, and ought to be no inclination\r\nin the people of the free States, to enter into the slave States and\r\ninterfere with the question of slavery at all. I have said that always;\r\nJudge Douglas has heard me say it. And when it is said that I am in\r\nfavour of interfering with slavery where it exists, I know it is\r\nunwarranted by anything I have ever intended, and, as I believe, by\r\nanything I have ever said. If by any means I have ever used language\r\nwhich could fairly be so construed (as, however, I believe I never\r\nhave), I now correct it.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, for the inference that Judge Douglas draws, that I am in\r\nfavour of setting the sections at war with one another. I know that I\r\nnever meant any such thing, and I believe that no fair mind can infer\r\nany such thing from anything I have said.\r\n\r\nNow, in relation to his inference that I am in favour of a general\r\nconsolidation of all the local institutions of the various States.... I\r\nhave said very many times in Judge Douglas\'s hearing that no man\r\nbelieved more than I in the principle of self-government; that it lies\r\nat the bottom of all my ideas of just government from beginning to end.\r\nI have denied that his use of that term applies properly. But for the\r\nthing itself I deny that any man has ever gone ahead of me in his\r\ndevotion to the principle, whatever he may have done in efficiency in\r\nadvocating it. I think that I have said it in your hearing, that I\r\nbelieve each individual is naturally entitled to do as he pleases with\r\nhimself and the fruit of his labour, so far as it in no wise interferes\r\nwith any other man\'s rights; that each community, as a State, has a\r\nright to do exactly as it pleases with all the concerns within that\r\nState that interfere with the right of no other State; and that the\r\ngeneral government upon principle has no right to interfere with\r\nanything other than that general class of things that does concern the\r\nwhole. I have said that at all times; I have said as illustrations that\r\nI do not believe in the right of Illinois to interfere with the\r\ncranberry laws of Indiana, the oyster laws of Virginia, or the liquor\r\nlaws of Maine.\r\n\r\nHow is it, then, that Judge Douglas infers, because I hope to see\r\nslavery put where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in\r\nthe course of ultimate extinction, that I am in favour of Illinois going\r\nover and interfering with the cranberry laws of Indiana? What can\r\nauthorize him to draw any such inference? I suppose there might be one\r\nthing that at least enabled him to draw such an inference, that would\r\nnot be true with me or many others; that is, because he looks upon all\r\nthis matter of slavery as an exceedingly little thing,--this matter of\r\nkeeping one-sixth of the population of the whole nation in a state of\r\noppression and tyranny unequalled in the world. He looks upon it as\r\nbeing an exceedingly little thing, only equal to the question of the\r\ncranberry laws of Indiana; as something having no moral question in it;\r\nas something on a par with the question of whether a man shall pasture\r\nhis land with cattle or plant it with tobacco; so little and so small a\r\nthing that he concludes, if I could desire that anything should be done\r\nto bring about the ultimate extinction of that little thing, I must be\r\nin favour of bringing about an amalgamation of all the other little\r\nthings in the Union. Now, it so happens--and there, I presume, is the\r\nfoundation of this mistake--that the Judge thinks thus; and it so\r\nhappens that there is a vast portion of the American people that do not\r\nlook upon that matter as being this very little thing. They look upon it\r\nas a vast moral evil; they can prove it as such by the writings of those\r\nwho gave us the blessings of liberty which we enjoy, and that they so\r\nlooked upon it, and not as an evil merely confining itself to the States\r\nwhere it is situated; and while we agree that by the Constitution we\r\nassented to, in the States where it exists we have no right to interfere\r\nwith it, because it is in the Constitution, we are both by duty and\r\ninclination to stick by that Constitution in all its letter and spirit\r\nfrom beginning to end.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, as to my disposition, my wish, to have all the State\r\nlegislatures blotted out and to have one consolidated government and a\r\nuniformity of domestic regulations in all the States; by which I suppose\r\nit is meant, if we raise corn here we must make sugar-cane grow here\r\ntoo, and we must make those things which grow North grow in the South.\r\nAll this I suppose he understands I am in favour of doing. Now, so much\r\nfor all this nonsense--for I must call it so. The Judge can have no\r\nissue with me on a question of establishing uniformity in the domestic\r\nregulations of the States.\r\n\r\nA little now on the other point,--the Dred Scott decision. Another of\r\nthe issues, he says, that is to be made with me is upon his devotion to\r\nthe Dred Scott decision and my opposition to it.\r\n\r\nI have expressed heretofore, and I now repeat, my opposition to the Dred\r\nScott decision; but I should be allowed to state the nature of that\r\nopposition, and I ask your indulgence while I do so. What is fairly\r\nimplied by the term Judge Douglas has used, "resistance to the\r\ndecision"? I do not resist it. If I wanted to take Dred Scott from his\r\nmaster I would be interfering with property, and that terrible\r\ndifficulty that Judge Douglas speaks of, of interfering with property,\r\nwould arise. But I am doing no such thing as that; all that I am doing\r\nis refusing to obey it as a political rule. If I were in Congress, and a\r\nvote should come up on a question whether slavery should be prohibited\r\nin a new Territory, in spite of the Dred Scott decision, I would vote\r\nthat it should.\r\n\r\nThat is what I would do. Judge Douglas said last night that before the\r\ndecision he might advance his opinion, and it might be contrary to the\r\ndecision when it was made; but after it was made he would abide by it\r\nuntil it was reversed. Just so! We let this property abide by the\r\ndecision, but we will try to reverse that decision. We will try to put\r\nit where Judge Douglas would not object, for he says he will obey it\r\nuntil it is reversed. Somebody has to reverse that decision, since it is\r\nmade; and we mean to reverse it, and we mean to do it peaceably.\r\n\r\nWhat are the uses of decisions of courts? They have two uses. First,\r\nthey decide upon the question before the court. They decide in this case\r\nthat Dred Scott is a slave. Nobody resists that. Not only that, but they\r\nsay to everybody else that persons standing just as Dred Scott stands\r\nare as he is. That is, they say that when a question comes up upon\r\nanother person it will be so decided again, unless the court decides\r\nanother way, unless the court overrules its decision. Well, we mean to\r\ndo what we can to have the court decide the other way. That is one thing\r\nwe mean to try to do.\r\n\r\nThe sacredness that Judge Douglas throws around this decision is a\r\ndegree of sacredness that has never been before thrown around any other\r\ndecision. I have never heard of such a thing. Why, decisions apparently\r\ncontrary to that decision, or that good lawyers thought were contrary\r\nto that decision, have been made by that very court before. It is the\r\nfirst of its kind; it is an astonisher in legal history; it is a new\r\nwonder of the world; it is based upon falsehood in the main as to\r\nthe facts,--allegations of facts upon which it stands are not facts\r\nat all in many instances,--and no decision made on any question--the\r\nfirst instance of a decision made under so many unfavourable\r\ncircumstances--thus placed, has ever been held by the profession as law,\r\nand it has always needed confirmation before the lawyers regarded it as\r\nsettled law; but Judge Douglas will have it that all hands must take\r\nthis extraordinary decision made under these extraordinary circumstances\r\nand give their vote in Congress in accordance with it, yield to it, and\r\nobey it in every possible sense. Circumstances alter cases. Do not\r\ngentlemen here remember the case of that same Supreme Court some\r\ntwenty-five or thirty years ago, deciding that a national bank was\r\nconstitutional? I ask if somebody does not remember that a national bank\r\nwas declared to be constitutional? Such is the truth, whether it be\r\nremembered or not. The bank charter ran out, and a re-charter was\r\ngranted by Congress. That re-charter was laid before General Jackson. It\r\nwas urged upon him, when he denied the constitutionality of the bank,\r\nthat the Supreme Court had decided that it was constitutional; and\r\nGeneral Jackson then said that the Supreme Court had no right to lay\r\ndown a rule to govern a coordinate branch of the government, the members\r\nof which had sworn to support the Constitution,--that each member had\r\nsworn to support the Constitution as he understood it. I will venture\r\nhere to say that I have heard Judge Douglas say that he approved of\r\nGeneral Jackson for that act. What has now become of all his tirade\r\nagainst "resistance to the Supreme Court"?\r\n\r\nMy fellow-citizens, getting back a little,--for I pass from these\r\npoints,--when Judge Douglas makes his threat of annihilation upon the\r\n"alliance," he is cautious to say that that warfare of his is to fall\r\nupon the leaders of the Republican party. Almost every word he utters\r\nand every distinction he makes has its significance. He means for the\r\nRepublicans who do not count themselves as leaders to be his friends; he\r\nmakes no fuss over them, it is the leaders that he is making war upon.\r\nHe wants it understood that the mass of the Republican party are really\r\nhis friends. It is only the leaders that are doing something, that are\r\nintolerant, and require extermination at his hands. As this is clearly\r\nand unquestionably the light in which he presents that matter, I want to\r\nask your attention, addressing myself to Republicans here, that I may\r\nask you some questions as to where you, as the Republican party, would\r\nbe placed if you sustained Judge Douglas in his present position by a\r\nre-election? I do not claim, gentlemen, to be unselfish; I do not\r\npretend that I would not like to go to the United States Senate,--I make\r\nno such hypocritical pretence; but I do say to you, that in this mighty\r\nissue it is nothing to you, nothing to the mass of the people of the\r\nnation, whether or not Judge Douglas or myself shall ever be heard of\r\nafter this night. It may be a trifle to either of us; but in connection\r\nwith this mighty question, upon which hang the destinies of the nation,\r\nperhaps, it is absolutely nothing. But where will you be placed if you\r\nreindorse Judge Douglas? Don\'t you know how apt he is, how exceedingly\r\nanxious he is, at all times to seize upon anything and everything to\r\npersuade you that something he has done you did yourselves? Why, he\r\ntried to persuade you last night that our Illinois Legislature\r\ninstructed him to introduce the Nebraska bill. There was nobody in that\r\nLegislature ever thought of it; but still he fights furiously for the\r\nproposition; and that he did it because there was a standing instruction\r\nto our senators to be always introducing Nebraska bills. He tells you he\r\nis for the Cincinnati platform; he tells you he is for the Dred Scott\r\ndecision; he tells you--not in his speech last night, but substantially\r\nin a former speech--that he cares not if slavery is voted up or down; he\r\ntells you the struggle on Lecompton is past,--it may come up again or\r\nnot, and if it does, he stands where he stood when, in spite of him and\r\nhis opposition, you built up the Republican party. If you indorse him,\r\nyou tell him you do not care whether slavery be voted up or down, and he\r\nwill close, or try to close, your mouths with his declaration, repeated\r\nby the day, the week, the month, and the year. I think, in the position\r\nin which Judge Douglas stood in opposing the Lecompton constitution, he\r\nwas right; he does not know that it will return, but if it does we may\r\nknow where to find him; and if it does not, we may know where to look\r\nfor him, and that is on the Cincinnati platform. Now, I could ask the\r\nRepublican party, after all the hard names Judge Douglas has called them\r\nby, ... all his declarations of Black Republicanism--(by the way, we are\r\nimproving, the black has got rubbed off), but with all that, if he be\r\nindorsed by Republican votes, where do you stand? Plainly, you stand\r\nready saddled, bridled, and harnessed, and waiting to be driven over to\r\nthe slavery-extension camp of the nation,--just ready to be driven over,\r\ntied together in a lot,--to be driven over, every man with a rope around\r\nhis neck, that halter being held by Judge Douglas. That is the question.\r\nIf Republican men have been in earnest in what they have done, I think\r\nthey had better not do it; but I think the Republican party is made up\r\nof those who, as far as they can peaceably, will oppose the extension of\r\nslavery, and who will hope for its ultimate extinction. If they believe\r\nit is wrong in grasping up the new lands of the continent, and keeping\r\nthem from the settlement of free white labourers, who want the land to\r\nbring up their families upon; if they are in earnest,--although they may\r\nmake a mistake, they will grow restless, and the time will come when\r\nthey will come back again and reorganize, if not by the same name, at\r\nleast upon the same principles as their party now has. It is better,\r\nthen, to save the work while it is begun. You have done the labour;\r\nmaintain it, keep it. If men choose to serve you, go with them; but as\r\nyou have made up your organization upon principle, stand by it; for, as\r\nsurely as God reigns over you, and has inspired your minds and given you\r\na sense of propriety and continues to give you hope, so surely will you\r\nstill cling to these ideas, and you will at last come back again after\r\nyour wanderings, merely to do your work over again.\r\n\r\nWe were often,--more than once, at least,--in the course of Judge\r\nDouglas\'s speech last night, reminded that this government was made for\r\nwhite men,--that he believed it was made for white men. Well, that is\r\nputting it into a shape in which no one wants to deny it; but the Judge\r\nthen goes into his passion for drawing inferences that are not\r\nwarranted. I protest, now and for ever, against that counterfeit logic\r\nwhich presumes that, because I do not want a negro woman for a slave, I\r\ndo necessarily want her for a wife. My understanding is, that I need not\r\nhave her for either; but, as God made us separate, we can leave one\r\nanother alone, and do one another much good thereby. There are white men\r\nenough to marry all the white women, and enough black men to marry all\r\nthe black women; and in God\'s name let them be so married. The Judge\r\nregales us with the terrible enormities that take place by the mixture\r\nof races; that the inferior race bears the superior down. Why, Judge, if\r\nwe do not let them get together in the Territories, they won\'t mix\r\nthere. I should say at least that that was a self-evident truth.\r\n\r\nNow, it happens that we meet together once every year, somewhere about\r\nthe 4th of July, for some reason or other. These 4th of July gatherings,\r\nI suppose, have their uses. If you will indulge me, I will state what I\r\nsuppose to be some of them.\r\n\r\nWe are now a mighty nation: we are thirty, or about thirty, millions of\r\npeople, and we own and inhabit about one-fifteenth part of the dry land\r\nof the whole earth. We run our memory back over the pages of history for\r\nabout eighty-two years, and we discover that we were then a very small\r\npeople in point of numbers, vastly inferior to what we are now, with a\r\nvastly less extent of country, with vastly less of everything we deem\r\ndesirable among men. We look upon the change as exceedingly advantageous\r\nto us and to our posterity, and we fix upon something that happened away\r\nback, as in some way or other being connected with this rise of\r\nprosperity. We find a race of men living in that day whom we claim as\r\nour fathers and grandfathers; they were iron men; they fought for the\r\nprinciple that they were contending for, and we understand that by what\r\nthey then did, it has followed that the degree of prosperity which we\r\nnow enjoy has come to us. We hold this annual celebration to remind\r\nourselves of all the good done in this process of time,--of how it was\r\ndone, and who did it, and how we are historically connected with it; and\r\nwe go from these meetings in better humour with ourselves,--we feel more\r\nattached the one to the other, and more firmly bound to the country we\r\ninhabit. In every way we are better men, in the age and race and country\r\nin which we live, for these celebrations. But after we have done all\r\nthis, we have not yet reached the whole. There is something else\r\nconnected with it. We have, besides these men--descended by blood from\r\nour ancestors--among us, perhaps half our people who are not descendants\r\nat all of these men; they are men who have come from Europe,--German,\r\nIrish, French, and Scandinavian,--men that have come from Europe\r\nthemselves, or whose ancestors have come hither and settled here,\r\nfinding themselves our equal in all things. If they look back through\r\nthis history, to trace their connection with those days by blood, they\r\nfind they have none: they cannot carry themselves back into that\r\nglorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us; but\r\nwhen they look through that old Declaration of Independence, they find\r\nthat those old men say that "we hold these truths to be self-evident,\r\nthat all men are created equal," and then they feel that that moral\r\nsentiment taught in that day evidences their relation to those men, that\r\nit is the father of all moral principle in them, and that they have a\r\nright to claim it as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of\r\nthe flesh, of the men who wrote that Declaration; and so they are. That\r\nis the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of\r\npatriotic and liberty-loving men together; that will link those\r\npatriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of\r\nmen throughout the world.\r\n\r\nNow, sirs, for the purpose of squaring things with this idea of "don\'t\r\ncare if slavery is voted up or voted down"; for sustaining the Dred\r\nScott decision; for holding that the Declaration of Independence did not\r\nmean anything at all,--we have Judge Douglas giving his exposition of\r\nwhat the Declaration of Independence means, and we have him saying that\r\nthe people of America are equal to the people of England. According to\r\nhis construction, you Germans are not connected with it. Now, I ask you\r\nin all soberness, if all these things, if indulged in, if ratified, if\r\nconfirmed and indorsed, if taught to our children and repeated to them,\r\ndo not tend to rub out the sentiment of liberty in the country, and to\r\ntransform this government into a government of some other form? Those\r\narguments that are made, that the inferior race are to be treated with\r\nas much allowance as they are capable of enjoying; that as much is to be\r\ndone for them as their condition will allow,--what are these arguments?\r\nThey are the arguments that kings have made for enslaving the people in\r\nall ages of the world. You will find that all the arguments in favour of\r\nkingcraft were of this class; they always bestrode the necks of the\r\npeople,--not that they wanted to do it, but because the people were\r\nbetter off for being ridden. That is their argument; and this argument\r\nof the Judge is the same old serpent, that says, "You work, and I eat;\r\nyou toil, and I will enjoy the fruits of it." Turn in whatever way you\r\nwill,--whether it come from the mouth of a king, an excuse for enslaving\r\nthe people of his country, or from the mouth of men of one race as a\r\nreason for enslaving the men of another race,--it is all the same old\r\nserpent; and I hold, if that course of argumentation that is made for\r\nthe purpose of convincing the public mind that we should not care about\r\nthis, should be granted, it does not stop with the negro. I should like\r\nto know--taking this old Declaration of Independence, which declares\r\nthat all men are equal, upon principle, and making exceptions to\r\nit--where will it stop? If one man says it does not mean a negro, why\r\nnot another say it does not mean some other man? If that Declaration is\r\nnot the truth, let us get the statute-book in which we find it, and tear\r\nit out! Who is so bold as to do it? If it is not true, let us tear it\r\nout. [Cries of "No! No!"] Let us stick to it, then; let us stand firmly\r\nby it, then.\r\n\r\nIt may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities\r\nand impose them upon us, and to the extent that a necessity is imposed\r\nupon a man, he must submit to it. I think that was the condition in\r\nwhich we found ourselves when we established this government. We had\r\nslaves among us; we could not get our Constitution unless we permitted\r\nthem to remain in slavery; we could not secure the good we did secure,\r\nif we grasped for more; but, having by necessity submitted to that much,\r\nit does not destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties.\r\nLet that charter stand as our standard.\r\n\r\nMy friend has said to me that I am a poor hand to quote Scripture. I\r\nwill try it again, however. It is said in one of the admonitions of our\r\nLord, "Be ye [therefore] perfect even as your Father which is in heaven\r\nis perfect." The Saviour, I suppose, did not expect that any human\r\ncreature could be perfect as the Father in heaven; but He said: "As your\r\nFather in heaven is perfect, be ye also perfect." He set that up as a\r\nstandard, and he who did most toward reaching that standard attained the\r\nhighest degree of moral perfection. So I say in relation to the\r\nprinciple that all men are created equal, let it be as nearly reached as\r\nwe can. If we cannot give freedom to every creature, let us do nothing\r\nthat will impose slavery upon any other creature. Let us, then, turn\r\nthis government back into the channel in which the framers of the\r\nConstitution originally placed it. Let us stand firmly by each other.\r\nIf we do not do so, we are tending in the contrary direction, that our\r\nfriend Judge Douglas proposes,--not intentionally,--working in the\r\ntraces that tend to make this one universal slave nation. He is one that\r\nruns in that direction, and as such I resist him.\r\n\r\nMy friends, I have detained you about as long as I desired to do, and I\r\nhave only to say, let us discard all this quibbling about this man and\r\nthe other man, this race and that race and the other race being\r\ninferior, and therefore they must be placed in an inferior position. Let\r\nus discard all these things, and unite as one people throughout this\r\nland, until we shall once more stand up declaring that all men are\r\ncreated equal.\r\n\r\nMy friends, I could not, without launching off upon some new topic,\r\nwhich would detain you too long, continue to-night. I thank you for this\r\nmost extensive audience that you have furnished me to-night. I leave\r\nyou, hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until\r\nthere shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and\r\nequal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From a Speech at Springfield, Illinois. July 17, 1858_\r\n\r\n\r\n... There is still another disadvantage under which we labour, and to\r\nwhich I will ask your attention. It arises out of the relative positions\r\nof the two persons who stand before the State as candidates for the\r\nSenate. Senator Douglas is of world-wide renown. All the anxious\r\npoliticians of his party, or who have been of his party for years past,\r\nhave been looking upon him as certainly, at no distant day, to be the\r\nPresident of the United States. They have seen, in his round, jolly,\r\nfruitful face, post-offices, land-offices, marshalships, and cabinet\r\nappointments, charg\xc3\xa9ships and foreign missions, bursting and sprouting\r\nout in wonderful exuberance, ready to be laid hold of by their greedy\r\nhands. And as they have been gazing upon this attractive picture so\r\nlong, they cannot, in the little distraction that has taken place in the\r\nparty, bring themselves to give up the charming hope. But with greedier\r\nanxiety they rush about him, sustain him, and give him marches,\r\ntriumphal entries, and receptions, beyond what, even in the days of his\r\nhighest prosperity, they could have brought about in his favour. On the\r\ncontrary, nobody has ever expected me to be President. In my poor, lean,\r\nlank face, nobody has ever seen that any cabbages were sprouting out.\r\nThese are disadvantages, all taken together, that the Republicans labour\r\nunder. We have to fight this battle upon principle, and upon principle\r\nalone. I am in a certain sense made the standard-bearer in behalf of the\r\nRepublicans. I was made so merely because there had to be some one so\r\nplaced,--I being in no wise preferable to any other one of the\r\ntwenty-five, perhaps a hundred, we have in the Republican ranks. Then I\r\nsay, I wish it to be distinctly understood and borne in mind, that we\r\nhave to fight this battle without many--perhaps without any--of the\r\nexternal aids which are brought to bear against us. So I hope those with\r\nwhom I am surrounded have principle enough to nerve themselves for the\r\ntask, and leave nothing undone that can fairly be done to bring about\r\nthe right result. As appears by two speeches I have heard him deliver\r\nsince his arrival in Illinois, he gave special attention to the speech\r\nof mine delivered on the sixteenth of June. He says that he carefully\r\nread that speech. He told us that at Chicago a week ago last night, and\r\nhe repeated it at Bloomington last night.... He says it was evidently\r\nprepared with great care. I freely admit it was prepared with care....\r\nBut I was very careful not to put anything in that speech as a matter of\r\nfact, or make any inferences which did not appear to me to be true and\r\nfully warrantable. If I had made any mistake I was willing to be\r\ncorrected; if I had drawn any inference in regard to Judge Douglas or\r\nany one else, which was not warranted, I was fully prepared to modify it\r\nas soon as discovered. I planted myself upon the truth and the truth\r\nonly, so far as I knew it, or could be brought to know it.\r\n\r\nHaving made that speech with the most kindly feelings toward Judge\r\nDouglas, as manifested therein, I was gratified when I found that he had\r\ncarefully examined it, and had detected no error of fact, nor any\r\ninference against him, nor any misrepresentations, of which he thought\r\nfit to complain.... He seizes upon the doctrines he supposes to be\r\nincluded in that speech, and declares that upon them will turn the\r\nissues of the campaign. He then quotes, or attempts to quote, from my\r\nspeech. I will not say that he wilfully misquotes, but he does fail to\r\nquote accurately. His attempt at quoting is from a passage which I\r\nbelieve I can quote accurately from memory. I shall make the quotation\r\nnow, with some comments upon it, as I have already said, in order that\r\nthe Judge shall be left entirely without excuse for misrepresenting me.\r\nI do so now, as I hope, for the last time. I do this in great caution,\r\nin order that if he repeats his misrepresentation, it shall be plain to\r\nall that he does so wilfully. If, after all, he still persists, I shall\r\nbe compelled to reconstruct the course I have marked out for myself, and\r\ndraw upon such humble resources as I have for a new course, better\r\nsuited to the real exigencies of the case. I set out in this campaign\r\nwith the intention of conducting it strictly as a gentleman, in\r\nsubstance at least, if not in the outside polish. The latter I shall\r\nnever be, but that which constitutes the inside of a gentleman I hope I\r\nunderstand, and am not less inclined to practise than others. It was my\r\npurpose and expectation that this canvass would be conducted upon\r\nprinciple, and with fairness on both sides, and it shall not be my fault\r\nif this purpose and expectation shall be given up.\r\n\r\nHe charges, in substance, that I invite a war of sections; that I\r\npropose all local institutions of the different States shall become\r\nconsolidated and uniform. What is there in the language of that speech\r\nwhich expresses such purpose or bears such construction? I have again\r\nand again said that I would not enter into any one of the States to\r\ndisturb the institution of slavery. Judge Douglas said at Bloomington\r\nthat I used language most able and ingenious for concealing what I\r\nreally meant; and that while I had protested against entering into the\r\nslave States, I nevertheless did mean to go on the banks of the Ohio and\r\nthrow missiles into Kentucky, to disturb them in their domestic\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n... I have said that I do not understand the Declaration to mean that\r\nall men were created equal in all respects. The negroes are not our\r\nequals in colour; but I suppose it does mean to declare that all men are\r\nequal in some respects; they are equal in their right to "life, liberty,\r\nand the pursuit of happiness." Certainly the negro is not our equal in\r\ncolour, perhaps not in many other respects. Still, in the right to put\r\ninto his mouth the bread that his own hands have earned, he is the equal\r\nof every other man, white or black. In pointing out that more has been\r\ngiven you, you cannot be justified in taking away the little which has\r\nbeen given him. All I ask for the negro is, that if you do not like him,\r\nlet him alone. If God gave him but little, that little let him enjoy.\r\n\r\n... One more point on this Springfield speech, which Judge Douglas says\r\nhe has read so carefully. I expressed my belief in the existence of a\r\nconspiracy to perpetuate and nationalize slavery. I did not profess to\r\nknow it, nor do I now. I showed the part Judge Douglas had played in the\r\nstring of facts, constituting to my mind the proof of that conspiracy. I\r\nshowed the parts played by others.\r\n\r\nI charged that the people had been deceived into carrying the last\r\npresidential election, by the impression that the people of the\r\nTerritories might exclude slavery if they chose, when it was known in\r\nadvance by the conspirators that the court was to decide that neither\r\nCongress nor the people could so exclude slavery. These charges are more\r\ndistinctly made than anything else in the speech.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas has carefully read and re-read that speech. He has not, so\r\nfar as I know, contradicted those charges. In the two speeches which I\r\nheard he certainly did not. On his own tacit admission I renew that\r\ncharge. I charge him with having been a party to that conspiracy and to\r\nthat deception, for the sole purpose of nationalizing slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From Lincoln\'s Reply to Douglas in the First Joint Debate at Ottawa,\r\nIllinois. August 21, 1858_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a man bears himself somewhat misrepresented, it provokes him--at\r\nleast, I find it so with myself; but when misrepresentation becomes very\r\ngross and palpable, it is more apt to amuse him.... [After stating the\r\ncharge of an arrangement between himself and Judge Trumbull.]\r\n\r\nNow, all I have to say upon that subject is, that I think no man--not\r\neven Judge Douglas--can prove it, because it is not true. I have no\r\ndoubt he is "conscientious" in saying it. As to those resolutions that\r\nhe took such a length of time to read, as being the platform of the\r\nRepublican party in 1854, I say I never had anything to do with them,\r\nand I think Trumbull never had. Judge Douglas cannot show that either of\r\nus ever had anything to do with them....\r\n\r\nNow, about this story that Judge Douglas tells of Trumbull bargaining to\r\nsell out the old Democratic party, and Lincoln agreeing to sell out the\r\nold Whig party, I have the means of knowing about that; Judge Douglas\r\ncannot have; and I know there is no substance to it whatever....\r\n\r\nA man cannot prove a negative, but he has a right to claim that when a\r\nman makes an affirmative charge, he must offer some proof to show the\r\ntruth of what he says. I certainly cannot introduce testimony to show\r\nthe negative about things, but I have a right to claim that if a man\r\nsays he knows a thing, then he must show how he knows it. I always have\r\na right to claim this; and it is not satisfactory to me that he may be\r\n"conscientious" on the subject.\r\n\r\n... Anything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and\r\npolitical equality with the negro is but a specious and fantastic\r\narrangement of words, by which a man can prove a horse-chestnut to be a\r\nchestnut horse. I will say here, while upon this subject, that I have no\r\npurpose, either directly or indirectly, to interfere with the\r\ninstitution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have\r\nno lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so. I have no\r\npurpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and\r\nthe black races. There is a physical difference between the two, which,\r\nin my judgment, will probably for ever forbid their living together upon\r\nthe footing of perfect equality; and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity\r\nthat there must be a difference, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in\r\nfavour of the race to which I belong having the superior position. I\r\nhave never said anything to the contrary; but I hold, that,\r\nnotwithstanding all this, there is no reason in the world why the negro\r\nis not entitled to all the natural rights enumerated in the Declaration\r\nof Independence,--the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness. I hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man.\r\nI agree with Judge Douglas, he is not my equal in many respects,\r\ncertainly not in colour, perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment.\r\nBut in the right to eat the bread, without the leave of anybody, which\r\nhis own hand earns, he is my equal, and the equal of Judge Douglas, and\r\nthe equal of any living man.\r\n\r\n... As I have not used up so much of my time as I had supposed, I will\r\ndwell a little longer upon one or two of these minor topics upon which\r\nthe Judge has spoken. He has read from my speech at Springfield, in\r\nwhich I say that "a house divided against itself cannot stand." Does the\r\nJudge say it can stand? I don\'t know whether he does or not. The Judge\r\ndoes not seem to be attending to me just now, but I would like to know\r\nif it is his opinion that a house divided against itself can stand? If\r\nhe does, then there is a question of veracity, not between him and me,\r\nbut between the Judge and an authority of a somewhat higher character.\r\n\r\nNow, my friends, I ask your attention to this matter for the purpose of\r\nsaying something seriously, I know that the Judge may readily enough\r\nagree with me that the maxim which was put forth by the Saviour is true,\r\nbut he may allege that I misapply it; and the Judge has a right to urge\r\nthat in my application I do misapply it, and then I have a right to show\r\nthat I do not misapply it. When he undertakes to say that because I\r\nthink this nation, so far as the question of slavery is concerned, will\r\nall become one thing or all the other, I am in favour of bringing about\r\na dead uniformity in the various States, in all their institutions, he\r\nargues erroneously. The great variety of local institutions in the\r\nStates, springing from differences in the soil, differences in the face\r\nof the country, and in the climate, are bonds of union. They do not make\r\n"a house divided against itself," but they make a house united. If they\r\nproduce in one section of the country what is called for by the wants of\r\nanother section, and this other section can supply the wants of the\r\nfirst, they are not matters of discord, but bonds of union, true bonds\r\nof union. But can this question of slavery be considered as among these\r\nvarieties in the institutions of the country? I leave it for you to say,\r\nwhether in the history of our government, this institution of slavery\r\nhas not always failed to be a bond of union, and, on the contrary, been\r\nan apple of discord and an element of division in the house. I ask you\r\nto consider whether so long as the moral constitution of men\'s minds\r\nshall continue to be the same, after this generation and assemblage\r\nshall sink into the grave, and another race shall arise with the same\r\nmoral and intellectual development we have--whether, if that institution\r\nis standing in the same irritating position in which it now is, it will\r\nnot continue an element of division?\r\n\r\nIf so, then I have a right to say that, in regard to this question, the\r\nUnion is a house divided against itself; and when the Judge reminds me\r\nthat I have often said to him that the institution of slavery has\r\nexisted for eighty years in some States, and yet it does not exist in\r\nsome others, I agree to the fact, and I account for it by looking at\r\nthe position in which our fathers originally placed it,--restricting it\r\nfrom the new Territories where it had not gone, and legislating to cut\r\noff its source by the abrogation of the slave-trade, thus putting the\r\nseal of legislation against its spread. The public mind did rest in the\r\nbelief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction. But lately, I\r\nthink,--and in this I charge nothing on the Judge\'s motives,--lately, I\r\nthink that he and those acting with him have placed that institution on\r\na new basis, which looks to the perpetuity and nationalization of\r\nslavery. And while it is placed on this new basis, I say, and I have\r\nsaid, that I believe we shall not have peace upon the question, until\r\nthe opponents of slavery arrest the further spread of it, and place it\r\nwhere the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course\r\nof ultimate extinction; or, on the other hand, that its advocates will\r\npush it forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the States,\r\nold as well as new, North as well as South. Now, I believe if we could\r\narrest the spread, and place it where Washington and Jefferson and\r\nMadison placed it, it would be in the course of ultimate extinction, and\r\nthe public mind would, as for eighty years past, believe that it was in\r\nthe course of ultimate extinction. The crisis would be past, and the\r\ninstitution might be let alone for a hundred years--if it should live so\r\nlong--in the States where it exists, yet it would be going out of\r\nexistence in the way best for both the black and the white races. [A\r\nvoice: "Then do you repudiate popular sovereignty?"] Well, then, let us\r\ntalk about popular sovereignty. What is popular sovereignty? Is it the\r\nright of the people to have slavery or not to have it, as they see fit,\r\nin the Territories? I will state--and I have an able man to watch me--my\r\nunderstanding is that popular sovereignty, as now applied to the\r\nquestion of slavery, does allow the people of a Territory to have\r\nslavery if they want to, but does not allow them not to have it if they\r\ndo not want it. I do not mean that if this vast concourse of people were\r\nin a Territory of the United States, any one of them would be obliged\r\nto have a slave if he did not want one; but I do say that, as I\r\nunderstand the Dred Scott decision, if any one man wants slaves, all the\r\nrest have no way of keeping that one man from holding them.\r\n\r\nWhen I made my speech at Springfield, of which the Judge complains, and\r\nfrom which he quotes, I really was not thinking of the things which he\r\nascribes to me at all. I had no thought in the world that I was doing\r\nanything to bring about a war between the free and slave States. I had\r\nno thought in the world that I was doing anything to bring about a\r\npolitical and social equality of the black and white races. It never\r\noccurred to me that I was doing anything or favouring anything to reduce\r\nto a dead uniformity all the local institutions of the various States.\r\nBut I must say, in all fairness to him, if he thinks I am doing\r\nsomething which leads to these bad results, it is none the better that I\r\ndid not mean it. It is just as fatal to the country, if I have any\r\ninfluence in producing it, whether I intend it or not. But can it be\r\ntrue that placing this institution upon the original basis--the basis\r\nupon which our fathers placed it--can have any tendency to set the\r\nNorthern and the Southern States at war with one another, or that it can\r\nhave any tendency to make the people of Vermont raise sugar-cane,\r\nbecause they raise it in Louisiana, or that it can compel the people of\r\nIllinois to cut pine logs on the Grand Prairie, where they will not\r\ngrow, because they cut pine logs in Maine, where they do grow? The Judge\r\nsays this is a new principle started in regard to this question. Does\r\nthe Judge claim that he is working on the plan of the founders of the\r\ngovernment? I think he says in some of his speeches--indeed, I have one\r\nhere now--that he saw evidence of a policy to allow slavery to be south\r\nof a certain line, while north of it it should be excluded, and he saw\r\nan indisposition on the part of the country to stand upon that policy,\r\nand, therefore, he set about studying the subject upon original\r\nprinciples, and upon original principles he got up the Nebraska bill! I\r\nam fighting it upon these "original principles"--fighting it in the\r\nJeffersonian, Washingtonian, Madisonian fashion....\r\n\r\nIf I have brought forward anything not a fact, if he (Judge Douglas)\r\nwill point it out, it will not even ruffle me to take it back. But if he\r\nwill not point out anything erroneous in the evidence, is it not rather\r\nfor him to show by a comparison of the evidence that I have reasoned\r\nfalsely, than to call the "kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman" a liar?\r\n\r\nI want to ask your attention to a portion of the Nebraska bill which\r\nJudge Douglas has quoted: "It being the true intent and meaning of this\r\nact, not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to\r\nexclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to\r\nform and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject\r\nonly to the Constitution of the United States." Thereupon Judge Douglas\r\nand others began to argue in favour of "popular sovereignty,"--the right\r\nof the people to have slaves if they wanted them, and to exclude slavery\r\nif they did not want them. "But," said, in substance, a senator from\r\nOhio (Mr. Chase, I believe), "we more than suspect that you do not mean\r\nto allow the people to exclude slavery if they wish to; and if you do\r\nmean it, accept an amendment which I propose, expressly authorizing the\r\npeople to exclude slavery." I believe I have the amendment here before\r\nme, which was offered, and under which the people of the Territory,\r\nthrough their proper representatives, might, if they saw fit, prohibit\r\nthe existence of slavery therein.\r\n\r\nAnd now I state it as a fact, to be taken back if there is any mistake\r\nabout it, that Judge Douglas and those acting with him voted that\r\namendment down. I now think that those who voted it down had a real\r\nreason for doing so. They know what that reason was. It looks to us,\r\nsince we have seen the Dred Scott decision pronounced, holding that\r\n"under the Constitution" the people cannot exclude slavery--I say it\r\nlooks to outsiders, poor, simple, "amiable, intelligent gentlemen," as\r\nthough the niche was left as a place to put that Dred Scott decision\r\nin, a niche that would have been spoiled by adopting the amendment. And\r\nnow I say again, if this was not the reason, it will avail the Judge\r\nmuch more to calmly and good-humouredly point out to these people what\r\nthat other reason was for voting the amendment down, than swelling\r\nhimself up to vociferate that he may be provoked to call somebody a\r\nliar.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is in that same quotation from the Nebraska bill this\r\nclause: "it being the true intent and meaning of this bill not to\r\nlegislate slavery into any Territory or State." I have always been\r\npuzzled to know what business the word "State" had in that connection.\r\nJudge Douglas knows--he put it there. He knows what he put it there for.\r\nWe outsiders cannot say what he put it there for. The law they were\r\npassing was not about States, and was not making provision for States.\r\nWhat was it placed there for? After seeing the Dred Scott decision,\r\nwhich holds that the people cannot exclude slavery from a Territory, if\r\nanother Dred Scott decision shall come, holding that they cannot exclude\r\nit from a State, we shall discover that when the word was originally put\r\nthere, it was in view of something that was to come in due time; we\r\nshall see that it was the other half of something. I now say again, if\r\nthere was any different reason for putting it there, Judge Douglas, in a\r\ngood-humoured way, without calling anybody a liar, can tell what the\r\nreason was....\r\n\r\nNow, my friends, ... I ask the attention of the people here assembled,\r\nand elsewhere, to the course that Judge Douglas is pursuing every day as\r\nbearing upon this question of making slavery national. Not going back to\r\nthe records, but taking the speeches he makes, the speeches he made\r\nyesterday and the day before, and makes constantly, all over the\r\ncountry, I ask your attention to them. In the first place, what is\r\nnecessary to make the institution national? Not war: there is no danger\r\nthat the people of Kentucky will shoulder their muskets and ... march\r\ninto Illinois to force the blacks upon us. There is no danger of our\r\ngoing over there, and making war upon them. Then what is necessary for\r\nthe nationalization of slavery? It is simply the next Dred Scott\r\ndecision. It is merely for the Supreme Court to decide that no State\r\nunder the Constitution can exclude it, just as they have already decided\r\nthat under the Constitution neither Congress nor the territorial\r\nlegislature can do it. When that is decided and acquiesced in, the whole\r\nthing is done. This being true and this being the way, as I think, that\r\nslavery is to be made national, let us consider what Judge Douglas is\r\ndoing every day to that end. In the first place, let us see what\r\ninfluence he is exerting on public sentiment. In this and like\r\ncommunities, public sentiment is everything. With public sentiment\r\nnothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed. Consequently he who\r\nmoulds public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or\r\npronounces decisions. He makes statutes and decisions possible or\r\nimpossible to be executed. This must be borne in mind, as also the\r\nadditional fact that Judge Douglas is a man of vast influence, so great\r\nthat it is enough for many men to profess to believe anything when they\r\nonce find out that Judge Douglas professes to believe it. Consider also\r\nthe attitude he occupies at the head of a large party,--a party which he\r\nclaims has a majority of all the voters in the country.\r\n\r\nThis man sticks to a decision which forbids the people of a Territory to\r\nexclude slavery, and he does so not because he says it is right in\r\nitself,--he does not give any opinion on that,--but because it has been\r\ndecided by the Court, and, being decided by the Court, he is, and you\r\nare, bound to take it in your political action as law,--not that he\r\njudges at all of its merits, but because a decision of the Court is to\r\nhim a "Thus saith the Lord." He places it on that ground alone, and you\r\nwill bear in mind that thus committing himself unreservedly to this\r\ndecision, commits himself just as firmly to the next one as to this. He\r\ndid not commit himself on account of the merit or demerit of the\r\ndecision, but it is a "Thus saith the Lord." The next decision as much\r\nas this will be a "Thus saith the Lord." There is nothing that can\r\ndivert or turn him away from this decision. It is nothing that I point\r\nout to him that his great prototype, General Jackson, did not believe in\r\nthe binding force of decisions. It is nothing to him that Jefferson did\r\nnot so believe. I have said that I have often heard him approve of\r\nJackson\'s course in disregarding the decision of the Supreme Court\r\npronouncing a national bank constitutional. He says I did not hear him\r\nsay so. He denies the accuracy of my recollection. I say he ought to\r\nknow better than I, but I will make no question about this thing, though\r\nit still seems to me that I heard him say it twenty times. I will tell\r\nhim, though, that he now claims to stand on the Cincinnati platform,\r\nwhich affirms that Congress cannot charter a national bank in the teeth\r\nof that old standing decision that Congress can charter a bank. And I\r\nremind him of another piece of Illinois history on the question of\r\nrespect for judicial decisions, and it is a piece of Illinois history\r\nbelonging to a time when a large party to which Judge Douglas belonged,\r\nwere displeased with a decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois,\r\nbecause they had decided that a Governor could not remove a secretary of\r\nState, and I know that Judge Douglas will not deny that he was then in\r\nfavour of over-slaughing that decision, by the mode of adding five new\r\nJudges, so as to vote down the four old ones. Not only so, but it ended\r\nin the Judge\'s sitting down on the very bench as one of the five new\r\njudges to break down the four old ones. It was in this way precisely\r\nthat he got his title of Judge. Now, when the Judge tells me that men\r\nappointed conditionally to sit as members of a Court will have to be\r\ncatechized beforehand upon some subject, I say, "You know, Judge; you\r\nhave tried it!" When he says a Court of this kind will lose the\r\nconfidence of all men, will be prostituted and disgraced by such a\r\nproceeding, I say, "You know best, Judge; you have been through the\r\nmill."\r\n\r\nBut I cannot shake Judge Douglas\'s teeth loose from the Dred Scott\r\ndecision. Like some obstinate animal (I mean no disrespect) that will\r\nhang on when he has once got his teeth fixed--you may cut off a leg, or\r\nyou may tear away an arm, still he will not relax his hold. And so I may\r\npoint out to the Judge, and say that he is bespattered all over, from\r\nthe beginning of his political life to the present time, with attacks\r\nupon judicial decisions,--I may cut off limb after limb of his public\r\nrecord, and strive to wrench from him a single dictum of the Court, yet\r\nI cannot divert him from it. He hangs to the last to the Dred Scott\r\ndecision.... Henry Clay, my beau ideal of a statesman, ... once said of\r\na class of men who would repress all tendencies to liberty and ultimate\r\nemancipation, that they must, if they would do this, go back to the era\r\nof our independence, and muzzle the cannon that thunders its annual\r\njoyous return; that they must blow out the moral lights around us; they\r\nmust penetrate the human soul, and eradicate there the love of liberty;\r\nand then, and not till then, could they perpetuate slavery in this\r\ncountry! To my thinking, Judge Douglas is, by his example and vast\r\ninfluence, doing that very thing in this community when he says that the\r\nnegro has nothing in the Declaration of Independence. Henry Clay plainly\r\nunderstood the contrary. Judge Douglas is going back to the era of our\r\nRevolution, and, to the extent of his ability, muzzling the cannon which\r\nthunders its annual joyous return. When he invites any people, willing\r\nto have slavery, to establish it, he is blowing out the moral lights\r\naround us. When he says he "cares not whether slavery is voted down or\r\nvoted up,"--that it is a sacred right of self-government,--he is, in my\r\njudgment, penetrating the human soul and eradicating the light of reason\r\nand the love of liberty in this American people. And now I will only\r\nsay, that when, by all these means and appliances, Judge Douglas shall\r\nsucceed in bringing public sentiment to an exact accordance with his own\r\nviews; when these vast assemblages shall echo back all these sentiments;\r\nwhen they shall come to repeat his views and avow his principles, and to\r\nsay all that he says on these mighty questions,--then it needs only the\r\nformality of a second Dred Scott decision, which he indorses in advance,\r\nto make slavery alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new,\r\nNorth as well as South.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lincoln\'s Reply to Judge Douglas in the Second Joint Debate. Freeport,\r\nIllinois. August 27, 1858_\r\n\r\n... The plain truth is this. At the introduction of the Nebraska policy,\r\nwe believed there was a new era being introduced in the history of the\r\nRepublic, which tended to the spread and perpetuation of slavery. But in\r\nour opposition to that measure we did not agree with one another in\r\neverything. The people in the north end of the State were for stronger\r\nmeasures of opposition than we of the southern and central portions of\r\nthe State, but we were all opposed to the Nebraska doctrine. We had that\r\none feeling and one sentiment in common. You at the north end met in\r\nyour conventions, and passed your resolutions. We in the middle of the\r\nState and further south did not hold such conventions and pass the same\r\nresolutions, although we had in general a common view and a common\r\nsentiment. So that these meetings which the Judge has alluded to, and\r\nthe resolutions he has read from, were local, and did not spread over\r\nthe whole State. We at last met together in 1856, from all parts of the\r\nState, and we agreed upon a common platform. You who held more extreme\r\nnotions, either yielded those notions, or if not wholly yielding them,\r\nagreed to yield them practically, for the sake of embodying the\r\nopposition to the measures which the opposite party were pushing forward\r\nat that time. We met you then, and if there was anything yielded, it was\r\nfor practical purposes. We agreed then upon a platform for the party\r\nthroughout the entire State of Illinois, and now we are all bound as a\r\nparty to that platform. And I say here to you, if any one expects of me\r\nin the case of my election, that I will do anything not signified by\r\nour Republican platform and my answers here to-day, I tell you very\r\nfrankly, that person will be deceived. I do not ask for the vote of any\r\none who supposes that I have secret purposes or pledges that I dare not\r\nspeak out.... If I should never be elected to any office, I trust I may\r\ngo down with no stain of falsehood upon my reputation, notwithstanding\r\nthe hard opinions Judge Douglas chooses to entertain of me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From Lincoln\'s Reply at Jonesboro\'. September 15, 1858_\r\n\r\n\r\nLadies and Gentlemen, There is very much in the principles that Judge\r\nDouglas has here enunciated that I most cordially approve, and over\r\nwhich I shall have no controversy with him. In so far as he insisted\r\nthat all the States have the right to do exactly as they please about\r\nall their domestic relations, including that of slavery, I agree\r\nentirely with him. He places me wrong in spite of all I tell him, though\r\nI repeat it again and again, insisting that I have made no difference\r\nwith him upon this subject. I have made a great many speeches, some of\r\nwhich have been printed, and it will be utterly impossible for him to\r\nfind anything that I have ever put in print contrary to what I now say\r\non the subject. I hold myself under constitutional obligations to allow\r\nthe people in all the States, without interference, direct or indirect,\r\nto do exactly as they please, and I deny that I have any inclination to\r\ninterfere with them, even if there were no such constitutional\r\nobligation. I can only say again that I am placed improperly--altogether\r\nimproperly, in spite of all that I can say--when it is insisted that I\r\nentertain any other view or purpose in regard to that matter.\r\n\r\nWhile I am upon this subject, I will make some answers briefly to\r\ncertain propositions that Judge Douglas has put. He says, "Why can\'t\r\nthis Union endure permanently half slave and half free?" I have said\r\nthat I supposed it could not, and I will try, before this new audience,\r\nto give briefly some of the reasons for entertaining that opinion.\r\nAnother form of his question is, "Why can\'t we let it stand as our\r\nfathers placed it?" That is the exact difficulty between us. I say that\r\nJudge Douglas and his friends have changed it from the position in which\r\nour fathers originally placed it.\r\n\r\nI say in the way our fathers originally left the slavery question, the\r\ninstitution was in the course of ultimate extinction. I say when this\r\ngovernment was first established, it was the policy of its founders to\r\nprohibit the spread of slavery into the new Territories of the United\r\nStates where it had not existed. But Judge Douglas and his friends have\r\nbroken up that policy, and placed it upon a new basis, by which it is to\r\nbecome national and perpetual. All I have asked or desired anywhere is\r\nthat it should be placed back again upon the basis that the fathers of\r\nour government originally placed it upon. I have no doubt that it would\r\nbecome extinct for all time to come, if we had but readopted the policy\r\nof the fathers by restricting it to the limits it has already\r\ncovered--restricting it from the new Territories.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to dwell on this branch of the subject at great length at\r\nthis time, but allow me to repeat one thing that I have stated before.\r\nBrooks, the man who assaulted Senator Sumner on the floor of the Senate,\r\nand who was complimented with dinners and silver pitchers and\r\ngold-headed canes, and a good many other things for that feat, in one of\r\nhis speeches declared that when this government was originally\r\nestablished, nobody expected that the institution of slavery would last\r\nuntil this day. That was but the opinion of one man, but it is such an\r\nopinion as we can never get from Judge Douglas or anybody in favour of\r\nslavery in the North at all. You can sometimes get it from a Southern\r\nman. He said at the same time that the framers of our government did not\r\nhave the knowledge that experience has taught us--that experience and\r\nthe invention of the cotton gin have taught us that the perpetuation of\r\nslavery is a necessity. He insisted therefore upon its being changed\r\nfrom the basis upon which the fathers of the government left it to the\r\nbasis of perpetuation and nationalization.\r\n\r\nI insist that this is the difference between Judge Douglas and\r\nmyself--that Judge Douglas is helping the change along. I insist upon\r\nthis government being placed where our fathers originally placed it.\r\n\r\n... When he asks me why we cannot get along with it [slavery] in the\r\nattitude where our fathers placed it, he had better clear up the\r\nevidences that he has himself changed it from that basis; that he has\r\nhimself been chiefly instrumental in changing the policy of the fathers.\r\nAny one who will read his speech of the twenty-second of March last,\r\nwill see that he there makes an open confession, showing that he set\r\nabout fixing the institution upon an altogether different set of\r\nprinciples....\r\n\r\nNow, fellow-citizens, in regard to this matter about a contract between\r\nmyself and Judge Trumbull, and myself and all that long portion of Judge\r\nDouglas\'s speech on this subject. I wish simply to say, what I have said\r\nto him before, that he cannot know whether it is true or not, and I do\r\nknow that there is not a word of truth in it. And I have told him so\r\nbefore. I don\'t want any harsh language indulged in, but I do not know\r\nhow to deal with this persistent insisting on a story that I know to be\r\nutterly without truth. It used to be the fashion amongst men that when a\r\ncharge was made, some sort of proof was brought forward to establish it,\r\nand if no proof was found to exist, it was dropped. I don\'t know how to\r\nmeet this kind of an argument. I don\'t want to have a fight with Judge\r\nDouglas, and I have no way of making an argument up into the consistency\r\nof a corn-cob and stopping his mouth with it. All I can do is\r\ngood-humouredly to say, that from the beginning to the end of all that\r\nstory about a bargain between Judge Trumbull and myself, there is not a\r\nword of truth in it....\r\n\r\nWhen that compromise [of 1850] was made, it did not repeal the old\r\nMissouri Compromise. It left a region of United States territory half as\r\nlarge as the present territory of the United States, north of the line\r\nof 36\xc2\xb0 30\', in which slavery was prohibited by act of Congress. This\r\ncompromise did not repeal that one. It did not affect nor propose to\r\nrepeal it. But at last it became Judge Douglas\'s duty, as he thought\r\n(and I find no fault with him), as chairman of the Committee on\r\nTerritories, to bring in a bill for the organization of a territorial\r\ngovernment--first of one, then of two Territories north of that line.\r\nWhen he did so, it ended in his inserting a provision substantially\r\nrepealing the Missouri Compromise. That was because the Compromise of\r\n1850 had not repealed it. And now I ask why he could not have left that\r\ncompromise alone? We were quiet from the agitation of the slavery\r\nquestion. We were making no fuss about it. All had acquiesced in the\r\ncompromise measures of 1850. We never had been seriously disturbed by\r\nany Abolition agitation before that period.... I close this part of the\r\ndiscussion on my part by asking him the question again, Why, when we had\r\npeace under the Missouri Compromise, could you not have let it alone?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe tries to persuade us that there must be a variety in the different\r\ninstitutions of the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily\r\nproceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face of the country,\r\nand the difference of the natural features of the States. I agree to all\r\nthat. Have these very matters ever produced any difficulty amongst us?\r\nNot at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact that they have\r\nlaws in Louisiana designed to regulate the commerce that springs from\r\nthe production of sugar, or because we have a different class relative\r\nto the production of flour in this State? Have they produced any\r\ndifferences? Not at all. They are the very cements of this Union. They\r\ndon\'t make the house a house divided against itself. They are the props\r\nthat hold up the house and sustain the Union.\r\n\r\nBut has it been so with this element of slavery? Have we not always had\r\nquarrels and difficulties over it? And when will we cease to have\r\nquarrels over it? Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to\r\nobserve that we have generally had comparative peace upon the slavery\r\nquestion, and that there has been no cause for alarm until it was\r\nexcited by the effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has\r\nbeen limited to its present bounds, and there has been no effort to\r\nspread it, there has been peace. All the trouble and convulsion has\r\nproceeded from efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at\r\nthe date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again with the annexation\r\nof Texas; so with the territory acquired by the Mexican War; and it is\r\nso now. Whenever there has been an effort to spread it, there has been\r\nagitation and resistance. Now, I appeal to this audience (very few of\r\nwhom are my political friends), as rational men, whether we have reason\r\nto expect that the agitation in regard to this subject will cease while\r\nthe causes that tend to reproduce agitation are actively at work? Will\r\nnot the same cause that produced agitation in 1820, when the Missouri\r\nCompromise was formed,--that which produced the agitation upon the\r\nannexation of Texas, and at other times,--work out the same results\r\nalways? Do you think that the nature of man will be changed; that the\r\nsame causes that produced agitation at one time will not have the same\r\neffect at another?\r\n\r\nThis has been the result so far as my observation of the slavery\r\nquestion and my reading in history extend. What right have we then to\r\nhope that the trouble will cease, that the agitation will come to an\r\nend, until it shall either be placed back where it originally stood, and\r\nwhere the fathers originally placed it, or, on the other hand, until it\r\nshall entirely master all opposition? This is the view I entertain, and\r\nthis is the reason why I entertained it, as Judge Douglas has read from\r\nmy Springfield speech.\r\n\r\n... At Freeport I answered several interrogatories that had been\r\npropounded to me by Judge Douglas at the Ottawa meeting.... At the same\r\ntime I propounded four interrogatories to him, claiming it as a right\r\nthat he should answer as many for me as I did for him, and I would\r\nreserve myself for a future instalment when I got them ready. The Judge,\r\nin answering me upon that occasion, put in what I suppose he intends as\r\nanswers to all four of my interrogatories. The first one of these I\r\nhave before me, and it is in these words:\r\n\r\n     _Question 1._ If the people of Kansas shall by means entirely\r\n     unobjectionable in all other respects, adopt a State constitution\r\n     and ask admission into the Union under it, before they have the\r\n     requisite number of inhabitants according to the English bill--some\r\n     93,000--will you vote to admit them?\r\n\r\nAs I read the Judge\'s answer in the newspaper, and as I remember it as\r\npronounced at the time, he does not give any answer which is equivalent\r\nto yes or no,--I will or I won\'t. He answers at very considerable\r\nlength, rather quarrelling with me for asking the question, and\r\ninsisting that Judge Trumbull had done something that I ought to say\r\nsomething about; and finally, getting out such statements as induce me\r\nto infer that he means to be understood, he will, in that supposed case,\r\nvote for the admission of Kansas. I only bring this forward now, for the\r\npurpose of saying that, if he chooses to put a different construction\r\nupon his answer, he may do it. But if he does not, I shall from this\r\ntime forward assume that he will vote for the admission of Kansas in\r\ndisregard of the English bill. He has the right to remove any\r\nmisunderstanding I may have. I only mention it now, that I may hereafter\r\nassume this to have been the true construction of his answer, if he does\r\nnot now choose to correct me.\r\n\r\nThe second interrogatory I propounded to him was this:\r\n\r\n     _Question 2._ Can the people of a United States Territory in any\r\n     lawful way, against the wish of any citizen of the United States,\r\n     exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a State\r\n     constitution?\r\n\r\nTo this Judge Douglas answered that they can lawfully exclude slavery\r\nfrom the Territory prior to the formation of a constitution. He goes\r\non to tell us how it can be done. As I understand him, he holds that\r\nit can be done by the territorial legislature refusing to make any\r\nenactments for the protection of slavery in the Territory, and\r\nespecially by adopting unfriendly legislation to it. For the sake of\r\nclearness, I state it again: that they can exclude slavery from the\r\nTerritory,--first, by withholding what he assumes to be an indispensable\r\nassistance to it in the way of legislation; and second, by unfriendly\r\nlegislation. If I rightly understand him, I wish to ask your attention\r\nfor a while to his position.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the Supreme Court of the United States has decided\r\nthat any congressional prohibition of slavery in the Territories is\r\nunconstitutional: they have reached this proposition as a conclusion\r\nfrom their former proposition that the Constitution of the United States\r\nexpressly recognizes property in slaves; and from that other\r\nconstitutional provision that no person shall be deprived of property\r\nwithout due process of law. Hence they reach the conclusion that as the\r\nConstitution of the United States expressly recognizes property in\r\nslaves, and prohibits any person from being deprived of property without\r\ndue process of law, to pass an act of Congress by which a man who owned\r\na slave on one side of a line would be deprived of him if he took him on\r\nthe other side, is depriving him of that property without due process of\r\nlaw. That I understand to be the decision of the Supreme Court. I\r\nunderstand also that Judge Douglas adheres most firmly to that decision;\r\nand the difficulty is, how is it possible for any power to exclude\r\nslavery from the Territory unless in violation of that decision? That is\r\nthe difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate of the United States, in 1856, Judge Trumbull in a speech,\r\nsubstantially if not directly, put the same interrogatory to Judge\r\nDouglas, as to whether the people of a Territory had the lawful power to\r\nexclude slavery prior to the formation of a constitution? Judge Douglas\r\nthen answered at considerable length, and his answer will be found in\r\nthe "Congressional Globe," under date of June 9, 1856. The Judge said\r\nthat whether the people could exclude slavery prior to the formation of\r\na constitution or not, was a question to be decided by the Supreme\r\nCourt. He put that proposition, as will be seen by the "Congressional\r\nGlobe," in a variety of forms, all running to the same thing in\r\nsubstance,--that it was a question for the Supreme Court. I maintain\r\nthat when he says, after the Supreme Court has decided the question,\r\nthat the people may yet exclude slavery by any means whatever, he does\r\nvirtually say that it is not a question for the Supreme Court. He shifts\r\nhis ground. I appeal to you whether he did not say it was a question for\r\nthe Supreme Court? Has not the Supreme Court decided that question? When\r\nhe now says that the people may exclude slavery, does he not make it a\r\nquestion for the people? Does he not virtually shift his ground and say\r\nthat it is not a question for the court, but for the people? This is a\r\nvery simple proposition,--a very plain and naked one. It seems to me\r\nthat there is no difficulty in deciding it. In a variety of ways he said\r\nthat it was a question for the Supreme Court. He did not stop then to\r\ntell us that, whatever the Supreme Court decides, the people can by\r\nwithholding necessary "police regulations" keep slavery out. He did not\r\nmake any such answer. I submit to you now, whether the new state of the\r\ncase has not induced the Judge to sheer away from his original ground?\r\nWould not this be the impression of every fair-minded man?\r\n\r\nI hold that the proposition that slavery cannot enter a new country\r\nwithout police regulations is historically false. It is not true at all.\r\nI hold that the history of this country shows that the institution of\r\nslavery was originally planted upon this continent without these "police\r\nregulations" which the Judge now thinks necessary for the actual\r\nestablishment of it. Not only so, but is there not another fact,--how\r\ncame this Dred Scott decision to be made? It was made upon the case of a\r\nnegro being taken and actually held in slavery in Minnesota Territory,\r\nclaiming his freedom because the act of Congress prohibited his being so\r\nheld there. Will the Judge pretend that Dred Scott was not held there\r\nwithout police regulations? There is at least one matter of record as to\r\nhis having been held in slavery in the Territory, not only without\r\npolice regulations, but in the teeth of congressional legislation\r\nsupposed to be valid at the time. This shows that there is vigour enough\r\nin slavery to plant itself in a new country, even against unfriendly\r\nlegislation. It takes not only law, but the enforcement of law to keep\r\nit out. That is the history of this country upon the subject.\r\n\r\nI wish to ask one other question. It being understood that the\r\nConstitution of the United States guarantees property in slaves in the\r\nTerritories, if there is any infringement of the right of that property,\r\nwould not the United States courts, organized for the government of the\r\nTerritory, apply such remedy as might be necessary in that case? It is a\r\nmaxim held by the courts that there is no wrong without its remedy; and\r\nthe courts have a remedy for whatever is acknowledged and treated as a\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nAgain: I will ask you, my friends, if you were elected members of the\r\nlegislature, what would be the first thing you would have to do before\r\nentering upon your duties? Swear to support the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. Suppose you believe as Judge Douglas does, that the\r\nConstitution of the United States guarantees to your neighbour the right\r\nto hold slaves in that Territory,--that they are his property,--how can\r\nyou clear your oaths unless you give him such legislation as is\r\nnecessary to enable him to enjoy that property? What do you understand\r\nby supporting the Constitution of a State or of the United States? Is it\r\nnot to give such constitutional helps to the rights established by that\r\nConstitution as may be practically needed? Can you, if you swear to\r\nsupport the Constitution and believe that the Constitution establishes a\r\nright, clear your oath without giving it support? Do you support the\r\nConstitution if, knowing or believing there is a right established under\r\nit which needs specific legislation, you withhold that legislation? Do\r\nyou not violate and disregard your oath? I can conceive of nothing\r\nplainer in the world. There can be nothing in the words "support the\r\nConstitution," if you may run counter to it by refusing support to any\r\nright established under the Constitution. And what I say here will hold\r\nwith still more force against the Judge\'s doctrine of "unfriendly\r\nlegislation." How could you, having sworn to support the Constitution,\r\nand believing that it guaranteed the right to hold slaves in the\r\nTerritories, assist in legislation intended to defeat that right? That\r\nwould be violating your own view of the Constitution. Not only so, but\r\nif you were to do so, how long would it take the courts to hold your\r\nvotes unconstitutional and void? Not a moment.\r\n\r\nLastly, I would ask, is not Congress itself under obligation to give\r\nlegislative support to any right that is established under the United\r\nStates Constitution? I repeat the question, is not Congress itself bound\r\nto give legislative support to any right that is established in the\r\nUnited States Constitution? A member of Congress swears to support the\r\nConstitution of the United States, and if he sees a right established by\r\nthat Constitution which needs specific legislative protection, can he\r\nclear his oath without giving that protection? Let me ask you why many\r\nof us, who are opposed to slavery upon principle, give our acquiescence\r\nto a fugitive-slave law? Why do we hold ourselves under obligations to\r\npass such a law, and abide by it when passed? Because the Constitution\r\nmakes provision that the owners of slaves shall have the right to\r\nreclaim them. It gives the right to reclaim slaves; and that right is,\r\nas Judge Douglas says, a barren right, unless there is legislation that\r\nwill enforce it.\r\n\r\nThe mere declaration, "No person held to service or labour in one State,\r\nunder the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of\r\nany law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or\r\nlabour, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such\r\nservice or labour may be due," is powerless without specific legislation\r\nto enforce it. Now, on what ground would a member of Congress who is\r\nopposed to slavery in the abstract, vote for a fugitive law, as I would\r\ndeem it my duty to do? Because there is a constitutional right which\r\nneeds legislation to enforce it. And, although it is distasteful to me,\r\nI have sworn to support the Constitution; and, having so sworn, I\r\ncannot conceive that I do support it if I withhold from that right any\r\nnecessary legislation to make it practical. And if that is true in\r\nregard to a fugitive-slave law, is the right to have fugitive slaves\r\nreclaimed any better fixed in the Constitution than the right to hold\r\nslaves in the Territories? For this decision is a just exposition of the\r\nConstitution, as Judge Douglas thinks. Is the one right any better than\r\nthe other? If I wished to refuse to give legislative support to slave\r\nproperty in the Territories, if a member of Congress, I could not do it,\r\nholding the view that the Constitution establishes that right. If I did\r\nit at all, it would be because I deny that this decision properly\r\nconstrues the Constitution. But if I acknowledge with Judge Douglas that\r\nthis decision properly construes the Constitution, I cannot conceive\r\nthat I would be less than a perjured man if I should refuse in Congress\r\nto give such protection to that property as in its nature it needed....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From Lincoln\'s Reply to Judge Douglas at Charleston, Illinois.\r\nSeptember 18, 1858_\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas has said to you that he has not been able to get from me\r\nan answer to the question whether I am in favour of negro citizenship.\r\nSo far as I know, the Judge never asked me the question before. He shall\r\nhave no occasion ever to ask it again, for I tell him very frankly that\r\nI am not in favour of negro citizenship.... Now my opinion is, that the\r\ndifferent States have the power to make a negro a citizen under the\r\nConstitution of the United States, if they choose. The Dred Scott\r\ndecision decides that they have not that power. If the State of Illinois\r\nhad that power, I should be opposed to the exercise of it. That is all I\r\nhave to say about it.\r\n\r\nJudge Douglas has told me that he heard my speeches north and my\r\nspeeches south, ... and there was a very different cast of sentiment in\r\nthe speeches made at the different points. I will not charge upon Judge\r\nDouglas that he wilfully misrepresents me, but I call upon every\r\nfair-minded man to take these speeches and read them, and I dare him to\r\npoint out any difference between my speeches north and south. While I am\r\nhere, perhaps I ought to say a word, if I have the time, in regard to\r\nthe latter portion of the Judge\'s speech, which was a sort of\r\ndeclamation in reference to my having said that I entertained the belief\r\nthat this government would not endure, half slave and half free. I have\r\nsaid so, and I did not say it without what seemed to me good reasons. It\r\nperhaps would require more time than I have now to set forth those\r\nreasons in detail; but let me ask you a few questions. Have we ever had\r\nany peace on this slavery question? When are we to have peace upon it if\r\nit is kept in the position it now occupies? How are we ever to have\r\npeace upon it? That is an important question. To be sure, if we will all\r\nstop and allow Judge Douglas and his friends to march on in their\r\npresent career until they plant the institution all over the nation,\r\nhere and wherever else our flag waves, and we acquiesce in it, there\r\nwill be peace. But let me ask Judge Douglas how he is going to get the\r\npeople to do that? They have been wrangling over this question for forty\r\nyears. This was the cause of the agitation resulting in the Missouri\r\nCompromise; this produced the troubles at the annexation of Texas, in\r\nthe acquisition of the territory acquired in the Mexican War. Again,\r\nthis was the trouble quieted by the Compromise of 1850, when it was\r\nsettled "for ever," as both the great political parties declared in\r\ntheir national conventions. That "for ever" turned out to be just four\r\nyears, when Judge Douglas himself reopened it.\r\n\r\nWhen is it likely to come to an end? He introduced the Nebraska bill in\r\n1854, to put another end to the slavery agitation. He promised that it\r\nwould finish it all up immediately, and he has never made a speech\r\nsince, until he got into a quarrel with the President about the\r\nLecompton constitution, in which he has not declared that we are just at\r\nthe end of the slavery agitation. But in one speech, I think last\r\nwinter, he did say that he didn\'t quite see when the end of the slavery\r\nagitation would come. Now he tells us again that it is all over, and the\r\npeople of Kansas have voted down the Lecompton constitution. How is it\r\nover? That was only one of the attempts to put an end to the slavery\r\nagitation,--one of these "final settlements." Is Kansas in the Union?\r\nHas she formed a constitution that she is likely to come in under? Is\r\nnot the slavery agitation still an open question in that Territory?...\r\nIf Kansas should sink to-day, and leave a great vacant space in the\r\nearth\'s surface, this vexed question would still be among us. I say,\r\nthen, there is no way of putting an end to the slavery agitation amongst\r\nus, but to put it back upon the basis where our fathers placed it; no\r\nway but to keep it out of our new Territories,--to restrict it for ever\r\nto the old States where it now exists. Then the public mind will rest in\r\nthe belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction. That is one\r\nway of putting an end to the slavery agitation.\r\n\r\nThe other way is for us to surrender, and let Judge Douglas and his\r\nfriends have their way, and plant slavery over all the States,--cease\r\nspeaking of it as in any way a wrong--regard slavery as one of the\r\ncommon matters of property, and speak of our negroes as we do of our\r\nhorse and cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From Lincoln\'s Reply to Judge Douglas at Galesburg, Illinois. October\r\n7, 1858_\r\n\r\n\r\n... The Judge has alluded to the Declaration of Independence, and\r\ninsisted that negroes are not included in that Declaration; and that it\r\nis a slander on the framers of that instrument to suppose that negroes\r\nwere meant therein; and he asks you, Is it possible to believe that Mr.\r\nJefferson, who penned that immortal paper, could have supposed himself\r\napplying the language of that instrument to the negro race, and yet held\r\na portion of that race in slavery? Would he not at once have freed\r\nthem? I only have to remark upon this part of his speech (and that too,\r\nvery briefly, for I shall not detain myself or you upon that point for\r\nany great length of time), that I believe the entire records of the\r\nworld, from the date of the Declaration of Independence up to within\r\nthree years ago, may be searched in vain for one single affirmation from\r\none single man, that the negro was not included in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence; I think I may defy Judge Douglas to show that he ever said\r\nso, that Washington ever said so, that any President ever said so, that\r\nany member of Congress ever said so, or that any living man upon the\r\nwhole earth ever said so, until the necessities of the present policy of\r\nthe Democratic party in regard to slavery had to invent that\r\naffirmation. And I will remind Judge Douglas and this audience, that\r\nwhile Mr. Jefferson was the owner of slaves, as undoubtedly he was, in\r\nspeaking on this very subject, he used the strong language that "he\r\ntrembled for his country when he remembered that God was just;" and I\r\nwill offer the highest premium in my power to Judge Douglas if he will\r\nshow that he, in all his life, ever uttered a sentiment at all akin to\r\nthat of Jefferson.\r\n\r\n... I want to call to the Judge\'s attention an attack he made upon me in\r\nthe first one of these debates.... In order to fix extreme Abolitionism\r\nupon me, Judge Douglas read a set of resolutions which he declared had\r\nbeen passed by a Republican State Convention, in October 1854, held at\r\nSpringfield, Illinois, and he declared that I had taken a part in that\r\nconvention. It turned out that although a few men calling themselves an\r\nanti-Nebraska State Convention had sat at Springfield about that time,\r\nyet neither did I take any part in it, nor did it pass the resolutions\r\nor any such resolutions as Judge Douglas read. So apparent had it become\r\nthat the resolutions that he read had not been passed at Springfield at\r\nall, nor by any State Convention in which I had taken part, that seven\r\ndays later at Freeport ... Judge Douglas declared that he had been\r\nmisled ... and promised ... that when he went to Springfield he would\r\ninvestigate the matter.... I have waited as I think a sufficient time\r\nfor the report of that investigation.\r\n\r\n... A fraud, an absolute forgery, was committed, and the perpetration of\r\nit was traced to the three,--Lanphier, Harris, and Douglas.... Whether\r\nit can be narrowed in any way, so as to exonerate any one of them, is\r\nwhat Judge Douglas\'s report would probably show. The main object of that\r\nforgery at that time was to beat Yates and elect Harris to Congress, and\r\nthat object was known to be exceedingly dear to Judge Douglas at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n... The fraud having been apparently successful upon that occasion, both\r\nHarris and Douglas have more than once since then been attempting to put\r\nit to new uses. As the fisherman\'s wife, whose drowned husband was\r\nbrought home with his body full of eels, said, when she was asked what\r\nwas to be done with him, \'Take out the eels and set him again,\' so\r\nHarris and Douglas have shown a disposition to take the eels out of that\r\nstale fraud by which they gained Harris\'s election, and set the fraud\r\nagain, more than once.... And now that it has been discovered publicly\r\nto be a fraud, we find that Judge Douglas manifests no surprise at\r\nall.... But meanwhile the three are agreed that each is a most\r\nhonourable man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notes for Speeches. October 1858_\r\n\r\n\r\nSuppose it is true that the negro is inferior to the white in the gifts\r\nof nature; is it not the exact reverse of justice that the white should\r\nfor that reason take from the negro any part of the little which he has\r\nhad given him? "Give to him that is needy" is the Christian rule of\r\ncharity; but "Take from him that is needy" is the rule of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe sum of pro-slavery theology seems to be this: "Slavery is not\r\nuniversally right, nor yet universally wrong; it is better for some\r\npeople to be slaves; and, in such cases, it is the will of God that they\r\nbe such."\r\n\r\nCertainly there is no contending against the will of God; but still\r\nthere is some difficulty in ascertaining and applying it to particular\r\ncases. For instance, we will suppose the Rev. Dr. Ross has a slave named\r\nSambo, and the question is, "Is it the will of God that Sambo shall\r\nremain a slave, or be set free?" The Almighty gives no audible answer to\r\nthe question, and his revelation, the Bible, gives none--or at most none\r\nbut such as admits of a squabble as to its meaning; no one thinks of\r\nasking Sambo\'s opinion on it. So at last it comes to this, that Dr. Ross\r\nis to decide the question; and while he considers it, he sits in the\r\nshade, with gloves on his hands, and subsists on the bread that Sambo is\r\nearning in the burning sun. If he decides that God wills Sambo to\r\ncontinue a slave, he thereby retains his own comfortable position; but\r\nif he decides that God wills Sambo to be free, he thereby has to walk\r\nout of the shade, throw off his gloves, and delve for his own bread.\r\nWill Dr. Ross be actuated by the perfect impartiality which has ever\r\nbeen considered most favourable to correct decisions?\r\n\r\nWe have in this nation the element of domestic slavery. It is a matter\r\nof absolute certainty that it is a disturbing element. It is the opinion\r\nof all the great men who have expressed an opinion upon it, that it is a\r\ndangerous element. We keep up a controversy in regard to it. That\r\ncontroversy necessarily springs from difference of opinion, and if we\r\ncan learn exactly--can reduce to the lowest elements--what that\r\ndifference of opinion is, we perhaps shall be better prepared for\r\ndiscussing the different systems of policy that we would propose in\r\nregard to that disturbing element.\r\n\r\nI suggest that the difference of opinion, reduced to its lowest terms,\r\nis no other than the difference between the men who think slavery a\r\nwrong and those who do not think it wrong. The Republican party think it\r\nwrong--we think it is a moral, a social, and a political wrong. We think\r\nit is a wrong not confining itself merely to the persons or the States\r\nwhere it exists, but that it is a wrong which in its tendency, to say\r\nthe least, affects the existence of the whole nation. Because we think\r\nit wrong, we propose a course of policy that shall deal with it as a\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nWe deal with it as with any other wrong, in so far as we can prevent its\r\ngrowing any larger, and so deal with it that in the run of time there\r\nmay be some promise of an end to it We have a due regard to the actual\r\npresence of it amongst us, and the difficulties of getting rid of it in\r\nany satisfactory way, and all the constitutional obligations thrown\r\nabout it. I suppose that in reference both to its actual existence in\r\nthe nation, and to our constitutional obligations, we have no right at\r\nall to disturb it in the States where it exists, and we profess that we\r\nhave no more inclination to disturb it than we have the right to do it.\r\nWe go further than that: we don\'t propose to disturb it where, in one\r\ninstance, we think the Constitution would permit us. We think the\r\nConstitution would permit us to disturb it in the District of Columbia.\r\nStill we do not propose to do that, unless it should be in terms which I\r\ndon\'t suppose the nation is very likely soon to agree to--the terms of\r\nmaking the emancipation gradual and compensating the unwilling owners.\r\nWhere we suppose we have the constitutional right, we restrain ourselves\r\nin reference to the actual existence of the institution and the\r\ndifficulties thrown about it. We also oppose it as an evil so far as it\r\nseeks to spread itself. We insist on the policy that shall restrict it\r\nto its present limits. We don\'t suppose that in doing this we violate\r\nanything due to the actual presence of the institution, or anything due\r\nto the constitutional guaranties thrown around it.\r\n\r\nWe oppose the Dred Scott decision in a certain way, upon which I ought\r\nperhaps to address you in a few words. We do not propose that when Dred\r\nScott has been decided to be a slave by the court, we, as a mob, will\r\ndecide him to be free. We do not propose that, when any other one, or\r\none thousand, shall be decided by that court to be slaves, we will in\r\nany violent way disturb the rights of property thus settled; but we\r\nnevertheless do oppose that decision as a political rule, which shall be\r\nbinding on the voter to vote for nobody who thinks it wrong, which shall\r\nbe binding on the members of Congress or the President to favour no\r\nmeasure that does not actually concur with the principles of that\r\ndecision. We do not propose to be bound by it as a political rule in\r\nthat way, because we think it lays the foundation not merely of\r\nenlarging and spreading out what we consider an evil, but it lays the\r\nfoundation for spreading that evil into the States themselves. We\r\npropose so resisting it as to have it reversed if we can, and a new\r\njudicial rule established upon this subject.\r\n\r\nI will add this, that if there be any man who does not believe that\r\nslavery is wrong in the three aspects which I have mentioned, or in any\r\none of them, that man is misplaced and ought to leave us. While, on the\r\nother hand, if there be any man in the Republican party who is impatient\r\nover the necessity springing from its actual presence, and is impatient\r\nof the constitutional guaranties thrown around it, and would act in\r\ndisregard of these, he too is misplaced, standing with us. He will find\r\nhis place somewhere else; for we have a due regard, so far as we are\r\ncapable of understanding them, for all these things. This, gentlemen, as\r\nwell as I can give it, is a plain statement of our principles in all\r\ntheir enormity.\r\n\r\nI will say now that there is a sentiment in the country contrary to\r\nme--a sentiment which holds that slavery is not wrong, and therefore\r\ngoes for the policy that does not propose dealing with it as a wrong.\r\nThat policy is the Democratic policy, and that sentiment is the\r\nDemocratic sentiment. If there be a doubt in the mind of any one of this\r\nvast audience that this is really the central idea of the Democratic\r\nparty, in relation to this subject, I ask him to bear with me while I\r\nstate a few things tending, as I think, to prove that proposition.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the leading man,--I think I may do my friend Judge\r\nDouglas the honour of calling him such,--advocating the present\r\nDemocratic policy, never himself says it is wrong. He has the high\r\ndistinction, so far as I know, of never having said slavery is either\r\nright or wrong. Almost everybody else says one or the other, but the\r\nJudge never does. If there be a man in the Democratic party who thinks\r\nit is wrong, and yet clings to that party, I suggest to him in the first\r\nplace that his leader don\'t talk as he does, for he never says that it\r\nis wrong.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, I suggest to him that if he will examine the policy\r\nproposed to be carried forward, he will find that he carefully excludes\r\nthe idea that there is anything wrong in it. If you will examine the\r\narguments that are made on it, you will find that every one carefully\r\nexcludes the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that Democrat who says he is as much opposed to slavery as I am\r\nwill tell me that I am wrong about this. I wish him to examine his own\r\ncourse in regard to this matter a moment, and then see if his opinion\r\nwill not be changed a little. You say it is wrong; but don\'t you\r\nconstantly object to anybody else saying so? Do you not constantly argue\r\nthat this is not the right place to oppose it? You say it must not be\r\nopposed in the free States, because slavery is not there; it must not be\r\nopposed in the slave States, because it is there; it must not be opposed\r\nin politics, because that will make a fuss; it must not be opposed in\r\nthe pulpit, because it is not religion. Then where is the place to\r\noppose it? There is no suitable place to oppose it. There is no plan in\r\nthe country to oppose this evil overspreading the continent, which you\r\nsay yourself is coming. Frank Blair and Gratz Brown tried to get up a\r\nsystem of gradual emancipation in Missouri, had an election in August,\r\nand got beat; and you, Mr. Democrat, threw up your hat and hallooed,\r\n"Hurrah for Democracy!"\r\n\r\nSo I say again, that in regard to the arguments that are made, when\r\nJudge Douglas says he "don\'t care whether slavery is voted up or voted\r\ndown," whether he means that as an individual expression of sentiment,\r\nor only as a sort of statement of his views on national policy, it is\r\nalike true to say that he can thus argue logically if he don\'t see\r\nanything wrong in it; but he cannot say so logically if he admits that\r\nslavery is wrong. He cannot say that he would as soon see a wrong voted\r\nup as voted down. When Judge Douglas says that whoever or whatever\r\ncommunity wants slaves, they have a right to have them, he is perfectly\r\nlogical if there is nothing wrong in the institution; but if you admit\r\nthat it is wrong, he cannot logically say that anybody has a right to do\r\nwrong. When he says that slave property and horse and hog property are\r\nalike to be allowed to go into the Territories, upon the principles of\r\nequality, he is reasoning truly if there is no difference between them\r\nas property; but if the one is property, held rightfully, and the other\r\nis wrong, then there is no equality between the right and wrong; so\r\nthat, turn it in any way you can, in all the arguments sustaining the\r\nDemocratic policy, and in that policy itself, there is a careful,\r\nstudied exclusion of the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery.\r\n\r\nLet us understand this. I am not, just here, trying to prove that we are\r\nright and they are wrong. I have been stating where we and they stand,\r\nand trying to show what is the real difference between us; and I now say\r\nthat whenever we can get the question distinctly stated,--can get all\r\nthese men who believe that slavery is in some of these respects wrong,\r\nto stand and act with us in treating it as a wrong,--then, and not till\r\nthen, I think, will we in some way come to an end of this slavery\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln\'s Reply to Judge Douglas in the Seventh and Last Debate.\r\nAlton, Illinois. October 15, 1858_\r\n\r\n\r\n... But is it true that all the difficulty and agitation we have in\r\nregard to this institution of slavery springs from office-seeking,--from\r\nthe mere ambition of politicians? Is that the truth? How many times have\r\nwe had danger from this question? Go back to the day of the Missouri\r\nCompromise. Go back to the nullification question, at the bottom of\r\nwhich lay this same slavery question. Go back to the time of the\r\nannexation of Texas. Go back to the troubles that led to the Compromise\r\nof 1850. You will find that every time, with the single exception of the\r\nnullification question, they sprung from an endeavour to spread this\r\ninstitution. There never was a party in the history of this country, and\r\nthere probably never will be, of sufficient strength to disturb the\r\ngeneral peace of the country. Parties themselves may be divided and\r\nquarrel on minor questions, yet it extends not beyond the parties\r\nthemselves. But does not this question make a disturbance outside of\r\npolitical circles? Does it not enter into the churches and rend them\r\nasunder? What divided the great Methodist Church into two parts, North\r\nand South? What has raised this constant disturbance in every\r\nPresbyterian General Assembly that meets? What disturbed the Unitarian\r\nChurch in this very city two years ago? What has jarred and shaken the\r\ngreat American Tract Society recently,--not yet splitting it, but sure\r\nto divide it in the end? Is it not this same mighty, deep-seated power,\r\nthat somehow operates on the minds of men, exciting and stirring them up\r\nin every avenue of society, in politics, in religion, in literature, in\r\nmorals, in all the manifold relations of life? Is this the work of\r\npoliticians? Is that irresistible power which for fifty years has shaken\r\nthe government and agitated the people, to be stilled and subdued by\r\npretending that it is an exceedingly simple thing, and we ought not to\r\ntalk about it? If you will get everybody else to stop talking about it,\r\nI assure you that I will quit before they have half done so. But where\r\nis the philosophy or statesmanship which assumes that you can quiet that\r\ndisturbing element in our society, which has disturbed us for more than\r\nhalf a century, which has been the only serious danger that has\r\nthreatened our institutions? I say where is the philosophy or the\r\nstatesmanship, based on the assumption that we are to quit talking about\r\nit, and that the public mind is all at once to cease being agitated by\r\nit? Yet this is the policy here in the North that Douglas is\r\nadvocating,--that we are to care nothing about it! I ask you if it is\r\nnot a false philosophy? Is it not a false statesmanship that undertakes\r\nto build up a system of policy upon the basis of caring nothing about\r\nthe very thing that everybody does care the most about,--a thing which\r\nall experience has shown we care a very great deal about?\r\n\r\n... The Judge alludes very often in the course of his remarks to the\r\nexclusive right which the States have to decide the whole thing for\r\nthemselves. I agree with him very readily.... Our controversy with him\r\nis in regard to the new Territories. We agree that when States come in\r\nas States they have the right and power to do as they please.... We\r\nprofess constantly that we have no more inclination than belief in the\r\npower of the government to disturb it; yet we are driven constantly to\r\ndefend ourselves from the assumption that we are warring upon the rights\r\nof the States. What I insist upon is, that the new Territories shall be\r\nkept free from it while in the territorial condition ...\r\n\r\n... These are false issues, upon which Judge Douglas has tried to force\r\nthe controversy....\r\n\r\nThe real issue in this controversy--the one dressing upon every mind--is\r\nthe sentiment on the part of one class that looks upon the institution\r\nof slavery as a wrong, and of another class that does not look upon it\r\nas a wrong. The sentiment that contemplates the institution of slavery\r\nin this country as a wrong is the sentiment of the Republican party. It\r\nis the sentiment around which all their actions, all their arguments,\r\ncircle; from which all their propositions radiate. They look upon it as\r\nbeing a moral, social, and political wrong; and while they contemplate\r\nit as such, they nevertheless have due regard for its actual existence\r\namong us, and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory\r\nway, and to all the constitutional obligations thrown about it. Yet,\r\nhaving a due regard for these, they desire a policy in regard to it that\r\nlooks to its not creating any more danger. They insist that it, as far\r\nas may be, be treated as a wrong; and one of the methods of treating it\r\nas a wrong is to make provision that it shall grow no larger. They also\r\ndesire a policy that looks to a peaceful end of slavery some time, as\r\nbeing a wrong. These are the views they entertain in regard to it, as I\r\nunderstand them; and all their sentiments, all their arguments and\r\npropositions are brought within this range, I have said, and I here\r\nrepeat it, that if there be a man amongst us who does not think that the\r\ninstitution of slavery is wrong in any one of the aspects of which I\r\nhave spoken, he is misplaced, and ought not to be with us. And if there\r\nbe a man amongst us who is so impatient of it as a wrong as to disregard\r\nits actual presence among us, and the difficulty of getting rid of it\r\nsuddenly in a satisfactory way, and to disregard the constitutional\r\nobligations thrown about it, that man is misplaced if he is on our\r\nplatform. We disclaim sympathy with him in practical action. He is not\r\nplaced properly with us.\r\n\r\nOn this subject of treating it as a wrong and limiting its spread, let\r\nme say a word. Has anything ever threatened the existence of this Union\r\nsave and except this very institution of slavery? What is it that we\r\nhold most dear amongst us? Our own liberty and prosperity. What has ever\r\nthreatened our liberty and prosperity save and except this institution\r\nof slavery? If this is true, how do you propose to improve the condition\r\nof things by enlarging slavery,--by spreading it out and making it\r\nbigger? You may have a wen or a cancer upon your person, and not be able\r\nto cut it out lest you bleed to death; but surely it is no way to cure\r\nit, to engraft it and spread it over your whole body. That is no proper\r\nway of treating what you regard as a wrong. You see this peaceful way of\r\ndealing with it as a wrong,--restricting the spread of it, and not\r\nallowing it to go into new countries where it has not already existed.\r\nThat is the peaceful way--the old-fashioned way--the way in which the\r\nfathers themselves set us the example.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I have said there is a sentiment which treats it as\r\nnot being wrong. That is the Democratic sentiment of this day. I do not\r\nmean to say that every man who stands within that range positively\r\nasserts that it is right. That class will include all who positively\r\nassert that it is right, and all who, like Judge Douglas, treat it as\r\nindifferent, and do not say it is either right or wrong. These two\r\nclasses of men fall within the general class of those who do not look\r\nupon it as a wrong. And if there be among you anybody who supposes that\r\nhe, as a Democrat, can consider himself "as much opposed to slavery as\r\nanybody," I would like to reason with him. You never treat it _as_ a\r\nwrong. What other thing that you consider a wrong do you deal with as\r\nyou deal with that? Perhaps you say it is wrong, but your leader never\r\ndoes, and you quarrel with anybody who says it is wrong. Although you\r\npretend to say so yourself, you can find no fit place to deal with it as\r\na wrong. You must not say anything about it in the free States, because\r\nit is not here. You must not say anything about it in the slave States,\r\nbecause it is there. You must not say anything about it in the pulpit,\r\nbecause that is religion, and has nothing to do with it. You must not\r\nsay anything about it in politics, because that will disturb the\r\nsecurity of "my place." There is no place to talk about it as being a\r\nwrong, although you say yourself it is a wrong. But, finally, you will\r\nscrew yourself up to the belief that if the people of the slave States\r\nshould adopt a system of gradual emancipation on the slavery question,\r\nyou would be in favour of it. You would be in favour of it! You say that\r\nis getting it in the right place, and you would be glad to see it\r\nsucceed. But you are deceiving yourself. You all know that Frank Blair\r\nand Gratz Brown, down there in St. Louis, undertook to introduce that\r\nsystem in Missouri. They fought as valiantly as they could for the\r\nsystem of gradual emancipation, which you pretend you would be glad to\r\nsee succeed. Now I will bring you to the test. After a hard fight they\r\nwere beaten; and when the news came over here, you threw up your hats\r\nand hurrahed for Democracy! More than that; take all the argument made\r\nin favour of the system you have proposed, and it carefully excludes the\r\nidea that there is anything wrong in the institution of slavery. The\r\narguments to sustain that policy carefully exclude it. Even here to-day,\r\nyou heard Judge Douglas quarrel with me, because I uttered a wish that\r\nit might sometime come to an end. Although Henry Clay could say he\r\nwished every slave in the United States was in the country of his\r\nancestors, I am denounced by those who pretend to respect Henry Clay,\r\nfor uttering a wish that it might sometime, in some peaceful way, come\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic policy in regard to that institution will not tolerate\r\nthe merest breath, the slightest hint, of the least degree of wrong\r\nabout it. Try it by some of Judge Douglas\'s arguments. He says he "don\'t\r\ncare whether it is voted up or voted down in the Territories." I do not\r\ncare myself in dealing with that expression whether it is intended to be\r\nexpressive of his individual sentiments on the subject or only of the\r\nnational policy he desires to have established.\r\n\r\nBut no man can logically say it who does see a wrong in it; because no\r\nman can logically say he don\'t care whether a wrong is voted up or voted\r\ndown.... Any man can say that who does not see anything wrong in\r\nslavery.... But if it is a wrong, he cannot say that people have a right\r\nto do wrong. He says that, upon the score of equality, slaves should be\r\nallowed to go into a new Territory like other property. This is strictly\r\nlogical if there is no difference between it and other property.... But\r\nif you insist that one is wrong and the other right, there is no use to\r\ninstitute a comparison between right and wrong.... The Democratic policy\r\neverywhere carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThat is the real issue. That is the issue that will continue in this\r\ncountry when these poor tongues of Judge Douglas and myself shall be\r\nsilent. It is the eternal struggle between these two principles--right\r\nand wrong--throughout the world. They are the two principles that have\r\nstood face to face from the beginning of time, and will ever continue to\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nThe one is the common right of humanity, and the other the divine right\r\nof kings. It is the same principle in whatever shape it develops itself.\r\nIt is the same spirit that says, "You toil and work and earn bread, and\r\nI\'ll eat it." No matter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth\r\nof a king, who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation and live\r\nby the fruit of their labour, or from one race of men as an apology for\r\nenslaving another race,--it is the same tyrannical principle....\r\nWhenever the issue can be distinctly made, and all extraneous matter\r\nthrown out, so that men can fairly see the real difference between the\r\nparties, this controversy will soon be settled, and it will be done\r\npeaceably, too. There will be no war, no violence. It will be placed\r\nagain where the wisest and best men of the world placed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From a Speech at Columbus, Ohio, on the Slave Trade, Popular\r\nSovereignty, etc. September 16, 1859_\r\n\r\n\r\n... The Republican party, as I understand its principles and policy,\r\nbelieves that there is great danger of the institution of slavery being\r\nspread out and extended, until it is ultimately made alike lawful in all\r\nthe States of this Union; so believing, to prevent that incidental and\r\nultimate consummation is the original and chief purpose of the\r\nRepublican organization.\r\n\r\nI say "chief purpose" of the Republican organization; for it is\r\ncertainly true that if the national House shall fall into the hands of\r\nthe Republicans, they will have to attend to all the matters of national\r\nhouse-keeping as well as this. The chief and real purpose of the\r\nRepublican party is eminently conservative. It proposes nothing save and\r\nexcept to restore this Government to its original tone in regard to this\r\nelement of slavery, and there to maintain it, looking for no further\r\nchange in reference to it than that which the original framers of the\r\nGovernment themselves expected and looked forward to.\r\n\r\nThe chief danger to this purpose of the Republican party is not just now\r\nthe revival of the African slave-trade, or the passage of a\r\nCongressional slave-code ... but the most imminent danger that now\r\nthreatens that purpose is that insidious Douglas popular sovereignty.\r\nThis is the miner and sapper. While it does not propose to revive the\r\nAfrican slave-trade, nor to pass a slave-code, nor to make a second Dred\r\nScott decision, it is preparing us for the onslaught and charge of these\r\nultimate enemies when they shall be ready to come on, and the word of\r\ncommand for them to advance shall be given. I say this _Douglas_ popular\r\nsovereignty--for there is a broad distinction, as I now understand it,\r\nbetween that article and a genuine popular sovereignty.\r\n\r\nI believe there is a genuine popular sovereignty. I think a definition\r\nof genuine popular sovereignty in the abstract would be about this: that\r\neach man shall do precisely as he pleases with himself, and with all\r\nthose things which exclusively concern him. Applied to governments, this\r\nprinciple would be, that a general government shall do all those things\r\nwhich pertain to it; and all the local governments shall do precisely as\r\nthey please in respect to those matters which exclusively concern them.\r\nI understand that this government of the United States under which we\r\nlive, is based upon this principle; and I am misunderstood if it is\r\nsupposed that I have any war to make upon that principle.\r\n\r\nNow, what is Judge Douglas\'s popular sovereignty? It is, as a principle,\r\nno other than that if one man chooses to make a slave of another man,\r\nneither that other man nor anybody else has a right to object. Applied\r\nin government, as he seeks to apply it, it is this: If, in a new\r\nTerritory into which a few people are beginning to enter for the purpose\r\nof making their homes, they choose to either exclude slavery from their\r\nlimits or to establish it there, however one or the other may affect the\r\npersons to be enslaved, or the infinitely greater number of persons who\r\nare afterward to inhabit that Territory, or the other members of the\r\nfamilies of communities of which they are but an incipient member, or\r\nthe general head of the family of States as parent of all,--however\r\ntheir action may affect one or the other of these, there is no power or\r\nright to interfere. That is Douglas popular sovereignty applied.\r\n\r\n... I cannot but express my gratitude that this true view of this\r\nelement of discord among us, as I believe it is, is attracting more and\r\nmore attention. I do not believe that Governor Seward uttered that\r\nsentiment because I had done so before, but because he reflected upon\r\nthis subject, and saw the truth of it. Nor do I believe, because\r\nGovernor Seward or I uttered it, that Mr. Hickman of Pennsylvania, in\r\ndifferent language, since that time, has declared his belief in the\r\nutter antagonism which exists between the principles of liberty and\r\nslavery. You see we are multiplying. Now, while I am speaking of\r\nHickman, let me say, I know but little about him. I have never seen him,\r\nand know scarcely anything about the man; but I will say this much about\r\nhim: of all the anti-Lecompton Democracy that have been brought to my\r\nnotice, he alone has the true, genuine ring of the metal.\r\n\r\n... Judge Douglas ... proceeds to assume, without proving it, that\r\nslavery is one of those little, unimportant, trivial matters which are\r\nof just about as much consequence as the question would be to me,\r\nwhether my neighbour should raise horned cattle or plant tobacco; that\r\nthere is no moral question about it, but that it is altogether a matter\r\nof dollars and cents; that when a new Territory is opened for\r\nsettlement, the first man who goes into it may plant there a thing\r\nwhich, like the Canada thistle or some other of those pests of the soil,\r\ncannot be dug out by the millions of men who will come thereafter; that\r\nit is one of those little things that is so trivial in its nature that\r\nit has no effect upon anybody save the few men who first plant upon the\r\nsoil; that it is not a thing which in any way affects the family of\r\ncommunities composing these States, nor any way endangers the general\r\ngovernment. Judge Douglas ignores altogether the very well-known fact\r\nthat we have never had a serious menace to our political existence\r\nexcept it sprang from this thing, which he chooses to regard as only\r\nupon a par with onions and potatoes.\r\n\r\n... Did you ever, five years ago, hear of anybody in the world saying\r\nthat the negro had no share in the Declaration of National Independence;\r\nthat it did not mean negroes at all; and when "all men" were spoken of,\r\nnegroes were not included?\r\n\r\n... Then I suppose that all now express the belief that the Declaration\r\nof Independence never did mean negroes. I call upon one of them to say\r\nthat he said it five years ago. If you think that now, and did not think\r\nit then, the next thing that strikes me is to remark that there has been\r\na _change_ wrought in you, and a very significant change it is, being no\r\nless than changing the negro, in your estimation, from the rank of a man\r\nto that of a brute....\r\n\r\nIs not this change wrought in your minds a very important change? Public\r\nopinion in this country is everything. In a nation like ours this\r\npopular sovereignty and squatter sovereignty have already wrought a\r\nchange in the public mind to the extent I have stated....\r\n\r\n... Now, if you are opposed to slavery honestly, I ask you to note that\r\nfact (the popular-sovereignty of Judge Douglas), and the like of which\r\nis to follow, to be plastered on, layer after layer, until very soon you\r\nare prepared to deal with the negro everywhere as with the brute. If\r\npublic sentiment has not been debauched already to this point, a new\r\nturn of the screw in that direction is all that is wanting; and this is\r\nconstantly being done by the teachers of this insidious popular\r\nsovereignty. You need but one or two turns further, until your minds,\r\nnow ripening under these teachings, will be ready for all these things,\r\nand you will receive and support or submit to the slave-trade, revived\r\nwith all its horrors,--a slave-code enforced in our Territories,--and a\r\nnew Dred Scott decision to bring slavery up into the very heart of the\r\nfree North.\r\n\r\n... I ask attention to the fact that in a pre-eminent degree these\r\npopular sovereigns are at this work: blowing out the moral lights around\r\nus; teaching that the negro is no longer a man, but a brute; that the\r\nDeclaration has nothing to do with him; that he ranks with the crocodile\r\nand the reptile; that man with body and soul is a matter of dollars and\r\ncents. I suggest to this portion of the Ohio Republicans, or Democrats,\r\nif there be any present, the serious consideration of this fact, that\r\nthere is now going on among you a steady process of debauching public\r\nopinion on this subject. With this, my friends, I bid you adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From a Speech at Cincinnati, Ohio, on the Intentions of "Black\r\nRepublicans," the Relation of Labour and Capital, etc. September 17,\r\n1859_\r\n\r\n\r\n... I say, then, in the first place to the Kentuckians that I am what\r\nthey call, as I understand it, a "Black Republican." I think slavery is\r\nwrong, morally and politically. I desire that it should be no further\r\nspread in these United States, and I should not object if it should\r\ngradually terminate in the whole Union. While I say this for myself, I\r\nsay to you, Kentuckians, that I understand you differ radically with me\r\nupon this proposition; that you believe slavery is a good thing; that\r\nslavery is right; that it ought to be extended and perpetuated in this\r\nUnion. Now, there being this broad difference between us, I do not\r\npretend, in addressing myself to you, Kentuckians, to attempt\r\nproselyting you. That would be a vain effort. I do not enter upon it. I\r\nonly propose to try to show you that you ought to nominate for the next\r\npresidency, at Charleston, my distinguished friend, Judge Douglas. In\r\nall that, there is no real difference between you and him; I understand\r\nhe is as sincerely for you, and more wisely for you than you are for\r\nyourselves. I will try to demonstrate that proposition.\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky perhaps--in many of the slave States certainly--you are\r\ntrying to establish the rightfulness of slavery by reference to the\r\nBible. You are trying to show that slavery existed in the Bible times by\r\nDivine ordinance. Now, Douglas is wiser than you, for your own benefit,\r\nupon that subject. Douglas knows that whenever you establish that\r\nslavery was right by the Bible, it will occur that that slavery was the\r\nslavery of the white man,--of men without reference to colour,--and he\r\nknows very well that you may entertain that idea in Kentucky as much as\r\nyou please, but you will never win any Northern support upon it. He\r\nmakes a wiser argument for you. He makes the argument that the slavery\r\nof the black man--the slavery of the man who has a skin of a different\r\ncolour from your own--is right. He thereby brings to your support\r\nNorthern voters, who could not for a moment be brought by your own\r\nargument of the Bible right of slavery.\r\n\r\n... At Memphis he [Judge Douglas] declared that in all contests between\r\nthe negro and the white man, he was for the white man, but that in all\r\nquestions between the negro and the crocodile, he was for the negro. He\r\ndid not make that declaration accidentally ... he made it a great many\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe first inference seems to be that if you do not enslave the negro,\r\nyou are wronging the white man in some way or other; and that whoever is\r\nopposed to the negro being enslaved is in some way or other against the\r\nwhite man. Is not that a falsehood? If there was a necessary conflict\r\nbetween the white man and the negro, I should be for the white man as\r\nmuch as Judge Douglas; but I say there is no such necessary conflict. I\r\nsay there is room enough for us all to be free, and that it not only\r\ndoes not wrong the white man that the negro should be free, but it\r\npositively wrongs the mass of the white men that the negro should be\r\nenslaved,--that the mass of white men are really injured by the effects\r\nof slave labour in the vicinity of the fields of their own labour....\r\n\r\nThere is one other thing that I will say to you in this relation. It is\r\nbut my opinion; I give it to you without a fee. It is my opinion that it\r\nis for you to take him or be defeated; and that if you do take him you\r\nmay be beaten. You will surely be beaten if you do not take him. We, the\r\nRepublicans and others forming the opposition of the country, intend "to\r\nstand by our guns," to be patient and firm, and in the long run to beat\r\nyou, whether you take him or not. We know that before we fairly beat\r\nyou, we have to beat you both together. We know that "you are all of a\r\nfeather," and that we have to beat you all together, and we expect to do\r\nit. We don\'t intend to be very impatient about it. We mean to be as\r\ndeliberate and calm about it as it is possible to be, but as firm and\r\nresolved as it is possible for men to be. When we do as we say, beat\r\nyou, you perhaps want to know what we will do with you.\r\n\r\nI will tell you, so far as I am authorized to speak for the opposition,\r\nwhat we mean to do with you. We mean to treat you, as near as we\r\npossibly can, as Washington, Jefferson, and Madison treated you. We mean\r\nto leave you alone, and in no way to interfere with your institution; to\r\nabide by all and every compromise of the Constitution, and, in a word,\r\ncoming back to the original proposition, to treat you, so far as\r\ndegenerate men (if we have degenerated) may, according to the example of\r\nthose noble fathers--Washington, Jefferson, and Madison. We mean to\r\nremember that you are as good as we; that there is no difference between\r\nus other than the difference of circumstances. We mean to recognize and\r\nbear in mind always, that you have as good hearts in your bosoms as\r\nother people, or as we claim to have, and to treat you accordingly. We\r\nmean to marry your girls when we have a chance--the white ones, I mean,\r\nand I have the honour to inform you that I once did have a chance in\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\nI have told you what we mean to do. I want to know, now, when that thing\r\ntakes place, what do you mean to do? I often hear it intimated that you\r\nmean to divide the Union whenever a Republican, or anything like it, is\r\nelected President of the United States. [A voice: "That is so."] "That\r\nis so," one of them says; I wonder if he is a Kentuckian? [A voice: "He\r\nis a Douglas man."] Well, then, I want to know what you are going to do\r\nwith your half of it. Are you going to split the Ohio down through, and\r\npush your half off a piece? Or are you going to keep it right alongside\r\nof us outrageous fellows? Or are you going to build up a wall some way\r\nbetween your country and ours, by which that movable property of yours\r\ncan\'t come over here any more, to the danger of your losing it? Do you\r\nthink you can better yourselves on that subject by leaving us here\r\nunder no obligation whatever to return those specimens of your movable\r\nproperty that come hither?\r\n\r\nYou have divided the Union because we would not do right with you, as\r\nyou think, upon that subject; when we cease to be under obligation to do\r\nanything for you, how much better off do you think you will be? Will you\r\nmake war upon us and kill us all? Why, gentlemen, I think you are as\r\ngallant and as brave men as live; that you can fight as bravely in a\r\ngood cause, man for man, as any other people living; that you have shown\r\nyourselves capable of this upon various occasions; but man for man, you\r\nare not better than we are, and there are not so many of you as there\r\nare of us. You will never make much of a hand at whipping us. If we were\r\nfewer in numbers than you, I think that you could whip us; if we were\r\nequal it would likely be a drawn battle; but being inferior in numbers,\r\nyou will make nothing by attempting to master us....\r\n\r\nLabour is the great source from which nearly all, if not all, human\r\ncomforts and necessities are drawn. There is a difference in opinion\r\nabout the elements of labour in society. Some men assume that there is a\r\nnecessary connection between capital and labour, and that connection\r\ndraws within it the whole of the labour of the community. They assume\r\nthat nobody works unless capital excites them to work. They begin next\r\nto consider what is the best way. They say there are but two ways,--one\r\nis to hire men and to allure them to labour by their consent; the other\r\nis to buy the men, and drive them to it, and that is slavery. Having\r\nassumed that, they proceed to discuss the question of whether the\r\nlabourers themselves are better off in the condition of slaves or of\r\nhired labourers, and they usually decide that they are better off in the\r\ncondition of slaves.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I say the whole thing is a mistake. That there is a\r\ncertain relation between capital and labour, I admit. That it does\r\nexist, and rightfully exist, I think is true. That men who are\r\nindustrious and sober and honest in the pursuit of their own interests\r\nshould after a while accumulate capital, and after that should be\r\nallowed to enjoy it in peace, and also if they should choose, when they\r\nhave accumulated it, to use it to save themselves from actual labour,\r\nand hire other people to labour for them,--is right. In doing so, they\r\ndo not wrong the man they employ, for they find men who have not their\r\nown land to work upon, or shops to work in, and who are benefited by\r\nworking for others,--hired labourers, receiving their capital for it.\r\nThus a few men that own capital hire a few others, and these establish\r\nthe relation of capital and labour rightfully--a relation of which I\r\nmake no complaint. But I insist that that relation, after all, does not\r\nembrace more than one-eighth of the labour of the country.\r\n\r\nThere are a plenty of men in the slave States that are altogether good\r\nenough for me, to be either President or Vice-President, provided they\r\nwill profess their sympathy with our purpose, and will place themselves\r\non such ground that our men upon principle can vote for them. There are\r\nscores of them--good men in their character for intelligence, for talent\r\nand integrity. If such an one will place himself upon the right ground,\r\nI am for his occupying one place upon the next Republican or opposition\r\nticket. I will go heartily for him. But unless he does so place himself,\r\nI think it is perfect nonsense to attempt to bring about a union upon\r\nany other basis; that if a union be made, the elements will so scatter\r\nthat there can be no success for such a ticket. The good old maxims of\r\nthe Bible are applicable, and truly applicable, to human affairs; and in\r\nthis, as in other things, we may say that he who is not for us is\r\nagainst us; he who gathereth not with us, scattereth. I should be glad\r\nto have some of the many good and able and noble men of the South place\r\nthemselves where we can confer upon them the high honour of an election\r\nupon one or the other end of our ticket. It would do my soul good to do\r\nthat thing. It would enable us to teach them that inasmuch as we select\r\none of their own number to carry out our principles, we are free from\r\nthe charge that we mean more than we say....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From a Letter to J.W. Fell. December 20, 1859_\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky. My parents\r\nwere both born in Virginia, of undistinguished families--second\r\nfamilies, perhaps I should say. My mother, who died in my tenth year,\r\nwas of a family of the name of Hanks, some of whom now reside in Adams,\r\nand others in Macon County, Illinois. My paternal grandfather, Abraham\r\nLincoln, emigrated from Rockingham County, Virginia, to Kentucky about\r\n1781 or 1782, where a year or two later he was killed by the Indians,\r\nnot in battle, but by stealth, when he was labouring to open a farm in\r\nthe forest. His ancestors, who were Quakers, went to Virginia from Berks\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania. An effort to identify them with the New England\r\nfamily of the same name ended in nothing more definite than a similarity\r\nof Christian names in both families, such as Enoch, Levi, Mordecai,\r\nSolomon, Abraham, and the like.\r\n\r\nMy father, at the death of his father, was but six years of age, and he\r\ngrew up literally without education. He removed from Kentucky to what is\r\nnow Spencer County, Indiana, in my eighth year. We reached our new home\r\nabout the time the State came into the Union. It was a wild region, with\r\nmany bears and other wild animals still in the woods. There I grew up.\r\nThere were some schools, so called, but no qualification was ever\r\nrequired of a teacher beyond "readin\', writin\', and cipherin\'" to the\r\nrule of three. If a straggler supposed to understand Latin happened to\r\nsojourn in the neighbourhood, he was looked upon as a wizard. There was\r\nabsolutely nothing to excite ambition for education. Of course, when I\r\ncame of age I did not know much. Still, somehow, I could read, write,\r\nand cipher to the rule of three, but that was all. I have not been to\r\nschool since. The little advance I now have upon this store of education\r\nI have picked up from time to time under the pressure of necessity.\r\n\r\nI was raised to farm work, which I continued till I was twenty-two. At\r\ntwenty-one I came to Illinois, Macon County. Then I got to New Salem, at\r\nthat time in Sangamon, now in Menard County, where I remained a year as\r\na sort of clerk in a store.\r\n\r\nThen came the Black Hawk War; and I was elected a captain of volunteers,\r\na success which gave me more pleasure than any I have had since. I went\r\nthe campaign, was elated, ran for the legislature the same year (1832),\r\nand was beaten--the only time I ever have been beaten by the people. The\r\nnext and three succeeding biennial elections I was elected to the\r\nlegislature. I was not a candidate afterward. During this legislative\r\nperiod I had studied law, and removed to Springfield to practise it. In\r\n1846 I was once elected to the lower House of Congress. Was not a\r\ncandidate for re-election. From 1849 to 1854, both inclusive, practised\r\nlaw more assiduously than ever before. Always a Whig in politics; and\r\ngenerally on the Whig electoral tickets, making active canvasses. I was\r\nlosing interest in politics when the repeal of the Missouri Compromise\r\naroused me again. What I have done since then is pretty well known.\r\n\r\nIf any personal description of me is thought desirable, it may be said I\r\nam, in height, six feet four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing on\r\nan average one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse\r\nblack hair and gray eyes. No other marks or brands recollected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From an Address delivered at Cooper Institute, New York. February 27,\r\n1860_\r\n\r\n\r\n... Now, and hear, let me guard a little against being misunderstood. I\r\ndo not mean to say we are bound to follow implicitly in whatever our\r\nfathers did. To do so, would be to discard all the lights of current\r\nexperience--to reject all progress, all improvement. What I do say is,\r\nthat if we would supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any\r\ncase, we should do so on evidence so conclusive, and argument so clear,\r\nthat even their great authority, fairly considered and weighed, cannot\r\nstand; and most surely not in a case whereof we ourselves declare they\r\nunderstood the question better than we.\r\n\r\nIf any man at this day sincerely believes that the proper division of\r\nlocal from Federal authority, or any part of the Constitution, forbids\r\nthe Federal Government to control as to slavery in the Federal\r\nTerritories, he is right to say so, and to enforce his position by all\r\ntruthful evidence and fair argument he can. But he has no right to\r\nmislead others who have less access to history, and less leisure to\r\nstudy it, into the false belief that "our fathers who framed the\r\ngovernment under which we live" were of the same opinion--thus\r\nsubstituting falsehood and deception for truthful evidence and fair\r\nargument. If any man at this day sincerely believes "our fathers who\r\nframed the government under which we live" used and applied principles,\r\nin other cases, which ought to have led them to understand that a proper\r\ndivision of local from Federal authority, or some part of the\r\nConstitution, forbids the Federal Government to control as to slavery in\r\nthe Federal Territories, he is right to say so. But he should, at the\r\nsame time, have the responsibility of declaring that, in his opinion, he\r\nunderstands their principles better than they did themselves; and\r\nespecially should he not shirk the responsibility by asserting that they\r\nunderstood the question just as well and even better than we do now.\r\n\r\nBut enough! Let all who believe that "our fathers who framed the\r\ngovernment under which we live understood this question just as well,\r\nand even better than we do now," speak as they spoke, and act as they\r\nacted upon it. This is all Republicans ask, all Republicans desire, in\r\nrelation to slavery. As those fathers marked it, so let it again be\r\nmarked, as an evil not to be extended, but to be tolerated and protected\r\nonly because of and so far as its actual presence among us makes that\r\ntoleration and protection a necessity. Let all the guaranties those\r\nfathers gave it be not grudgingly, but fully and fairly maintained. For\r\nthis Republicans contend, and with this, so far as I know or believe,\r\nthey will be content.\r\n\r\nAnd now, if they would listen,--as I suppose they will not,--I would\r\naddress a few words to the Southern people.\r\n\r\nI would say to them: You consider yourselves a reasonable and a just\r\npeople; and I consider that in the general qualities of reason and\r\njustice you are not inferior to any other people. Still, when you speak\r\nof us Republicans, you do so only to denounce us as reptiles, or, at the\r\nbest, as no better than outlaws. You will grant a hearing to pirates or\r\nmurderers, but nothing like it to "Black Republicans." In all your\r\ncontentions with one another, each of you deems an unconditional\r\ncondemnation of "Black Republicanism" as the first thing to be attended\r\nto. Indeed, such condemnation of us seems to be an indispensable\r\nprerequisite--license, so to speak--among you to be admitted or\r\npermitted to speak at all. Now, can you or not be prevailed upon to\r\npause and to consider whether this is quite just to us, or even to\r\nyourselves? Bring forward your charges and specifications, and then be\r\npatient long enough to hear us deny or justify.\r\n\r\nYou say we are sectional. We deny it. That makes an issue; and the\r\nburden of proof is upon you. You produce your proof; and what is it?\r\nWhy, that our party has no existence in your section--gets no votes in\r\nyour section. The fact is substantially true; but does it prove the\r\nissue? If it does, then, in case we should, without change of principle,\r\nbegin to get votes in your section, we should thereby cease to be\r\nsectional. You cannot escape this conclusion; and yet, are you willing\r\nto abide by it? If you are, you will probably soon find that we have\r\nceased to be sectional, for we shall get votes in your section this very\r\nyear. You will then begin to discover, as the truth plainly is, that\r\nyour proof does not touch the issue. The fact that we get no votes in\r\nyour section is a fact of your making, and not of ours.\r\n\r\nAnd if there be fault in that fact, that fault is primarily yours, and\r\nremains so until you show that we repel you by some wrong principle or\r\npractice. If we do repel you by any wrong principle or practice, the\r\nfault is ours; but this brings you to where you ought to have\r\nstarted--to a discussion of the right or wrong of our principle. If our\r\nprinciple, put in practice, would wrong your section for the benefit of\r\nours, or for any other object, then our principle, and we with it, are\r\nsectional, and are justly opposed and denounced as such. Meet us, then,\r\non the question of whether our principle, put in practice, would wrong\r\nyour section; and so meet us as if it were possible that something may\r\nbe said on our side. Do you accept the challenge? No! Then you really\r\nbelieve that the principle which "our fathers who framed the government\r\nunder which we live" thought so clearly right as to adopt it, and\r\nindorse it again and again, upon their official oaths, is in fact so\r\nclearly wrong as to demand your condemnation without a moment\'s\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nSome of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning against sectional\r\nparties given by Washington in his Farewell Address. Less than eight\r\nyears before Washington gave that warning he had, as President of the\r\nUnited States, approved and signed an act of Congress enforcing the\r\nprohibition of slavery in the Northwestern Territory, which act embodied\r\nthe policy of the government upon that subject up to and at the very\r\nmoment he penned that warning; and about one year after he penned it, he\r\nwrote Lafayette that he considered that prohibition a wise measure,\r\nexpressing in the same connection his hope that we should at some time\r\nhave a confederacy of free States.\r\n\r\nBearing this in mind, and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon\r\nthis same subject, is that warning a weapon in your hands against us, or\r\nin our hands against you? Could Washington himself speak, would he cast\r\nthe blame of that sectionalism upon us, who sustain his policy, or upon\r\nyou, who repudiate it? We respect that warning of Washington, and we\r\ncommend it to you, together with his example pointing to the right\r\napplication of it.\r\n\r\nBut you say you are conservative,--eminently conservative,--while we\r\nare revolutionary, destructive, or something of the sort.\r\n\r\nWhat is conservatism? Is it not adherence to the old and tried, against\r\nthe new and untried? We stick to, contend for, the identical old policy\r\non the point in controversy which was adopted by "our fathers who framed\r\nthe government under which we live"; while you with one accord reject,\r\nand scout, and spit upon that old policy, and insist upon substituting\r\nsomething new.\r\n\r\nTrue, you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be.\r\nYou are divided on new propositions and plans, but you are unanimous in\r\nrejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers. Some of you are\r\nfor reviving the foreign slave-trade; some for a Congressional\r\nslave-code for the Territories; some for Congress forbidding the\r\nTerritories to prohibit slavery within their limits; some for\r\nmaintaining slavery in the Territories through the judiciary; some for\r\nthe "gur-reat pur-rinciple" that "if one man would enslave another, no\r\nthird man should object," fantastically called "popular sovereignty";\r\nbut never a man among you is in favour of Federal prohibition of slavery\r\nin Federal Territories, according to the practice of "our fathers who\r\nframed the government under which we live." Not one of all your various\r\nplans can show a precedent or an advocate in the century within which\r\nour government originated.\r\n\r\nConsider, then, whether your claim for conservatism for yourselves, and\r\nyour charge of destructiveness against us, are based on the most clear\r\nand stable foundations.\r\n\r\nAgain, you say we have made the slavery question more prominent than it\r\nformerly was. We deny it. We admit that it is more prominent, but we\r\ndeny that we made it so. It was not we, but you, who discarded the old\r\npolicy of the fathers. We resisted, and still resist, your innovation;\r\nand thence comes the greater prominence of the question. Would you have\r\nthat question reduced to its former proportions? Go back to that old\r\npolicy. What has been will be again, under the same conditions. If you\r\nwould have the peace of the old times, readopt the precepts and policy\r\nof the old times.\r\n\r\nYou charge that we stir up insurrections among your slaves. We deny it;\r\nand what is your proof? Harper\'s Ferry! John Brown! John Brown was no\r\nRepublican; and you have failed to implicate a single Republican in his\r\nHarper\'s Ferry enterprise. If any member of our party is guilty in that\r\nmatter, you know it, or you do not know it. If you do know it, you are\r\ninexcusable for not designating the man and proving the fact. If you do\r\nnot know it, you are inexcusable for asserting it, and especially for\r\npersisting in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the\r\nproof. You need not be told that persisting in a charge which one does\r\nnot know to be true is simply malicious slander.\r\n\r\nSome of you admit that no Republican designedly aided or encouraged the\r\nHarper\'s Ferry affair, but still insist that our doctrines and\r\ndeclarations necessarily lead to such results. We do not believe it. We\r\nknow we hold no doctrine, and make no declaration, which were not held\r\nto and made by "our fathers who framed the government under which we\r\nlive." You never dealt fairly by us in relation to this affair. When it\r\noccurred, some important State elections were near at hand, and you were\r\nin evident glee with the belief that, by charging the blame upon us, you\r\ncould get an advantage of us in those elections. The elections came, and\r\nyour expectations were not quite fulfilled. Every Republican man knew\r\nthat, as to himself at least, your charge was a slander, and he was not\r\nmuch inclined by it to cast his vote in your favour. Republican\r\ndoctrines and declarations are accompanied with a continual protest\r\nagainst any interference whatever with your slaves, or with you about\r\nyour slaves. Surely this does not encourage them to revolt. True, we do,\r\nin common with "our fathers who framed the government under which we\r\nlive," declare our belief that slavery is wrong; but the slaves do not\r\nhear us declare even this. For anything we say or do, the slaves would\r\nscarcely know there is a Republican party. I believe they would not, in\r\nfact, generally know it but for your misrepresentations of us in their\r\nhearing. In your political contests among yourselves, each faction\r\ncharges the other with sympathy with Black Republicanism; and then, to\r\ngive point to the charge, defines Black Republicanism to simply be\r\ninsurrection, blood, and thunder among the slaves.\r\n\r\nSlave insurrections are no more common now than they were before the\r\nRepublican party was organized. What induced the Southampton\r\ninsurrection, twenty-eight years ago, in which at least three times as\r\nmany lives were lost as at Harper\'s Ferry? You can scarcely stretch your\r\nvery elastic fancy to the conclusion that Southampton was "got up by\r\nBlack Republicanism." In the present state of things in the United\r\nStates, I do not think a general, or even a very extensive, slave\r\ninsurrection is possible. The indispensable concert of action cannot be\r\nattained. The slaves have no means of rapid communication; nor can\r\nincendiary freemen, black or white, supply it. The explosive materials\r\nare everywhere in parcels; but there neither are, nor can be supplied,\r\nthe indispensable connecting trains.\r\n\r\nMuch is said by Southern people about the affection of slaves for their\r\nmasters and mistresses; and a part of it, at least, is true. A plot for\r\nan uprising could scarcely be devised and communicated to twenty\r\nindividuals before some one of them, to save the life of a favourite\r\nmaster or mistress, would divulge it. This is the rule; and the slave\r\nrevolution in Haiti was not an exception to it, but a case occurring\r\nunder peculiar circumstances. The Gunpowder Plot of British history,\r\nthough not connected with slaves, was more in point. In that case, only\r\nabout twenty were admitted to the secret; and yet one of them, in his\r\nanxiety to save a friend, betrayed the plot to that friend, and, by\r\nconsequence, averted the calamity. Occasional poisonings from the\r\nkitchen, and open or stealthy assassinations in the field, and local\r\nrevolts extending to a score or so, will continue to occur as the\r\nnatural results of slavery; but no general insurrection of slaves, as I\r\nthink, can happen in this country for a long time. Whoever much fears,\r\nor much hopes, for such an event, will be alike disappointed.\r\n\r\nIn the language of Mr. Jefferson, uttered many years ago, "It is still\r\nin our power to direct the process of emancipation and deportation\r\npeaceably, and in such slow degrees as that the evil will wear off\r\ninsensibly, and their places be, _pari passu_, filled up by free white\r\nlabourers. If, on the contrary, it is left to force itself on, human\r\nnature must shudder at the prospect held up."\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson did not mean to say, nor do I, that the power of\r\nemancipation is in the Federal Government. He spoke of Virginia; and, as\r\nto the power of emancipation, I speak of the slaveholding States only.\r\nThe Federal Government, however, as we insist, has the power of\r\nrestraining the extension of the institution--the power to insure that a\r\nslave insurrection shall never occur on any American soil which is now\r\nfree from slavery.\r\n\r\nJohn Brown\'s effort was peculiar. It was not a slave insurrection. It\r\nwas an attempt by white men to get up a revolt among slaves, in which\r\nthe slaves refused to participate. In fact, it was so absurd that the\r\nslaves, with all their ignorance, saw plainly enough it could not\r\nsucceed. That affair, in its philosophy, corresponds with the many\r\nattempts, related in history, at the assassination of kings and\r\nemperors. An enthusiast broods over the oppression of a people till he\r\nfancies himself commissioned by Heaven to liberate them. He ventures the\r\nattempt, which ends in little else than his own execution. Orsini\'s\r\nattempt on Louis Napoleon, and John Brown\'s attempt at Harper\'s Ferry,\r\nwere, in their philosophy, precisely the same. The eagerness to cast\r\nblame on Old England in the one case, and on New England in the other,\r\ndoes not disprove the sameness of the two things.\r\n\r\nAnd how much would it avail you if you could, by the use of John Brown,\r\nHelper\'s book, and the like, break up the Republican organization? Human\r\naction can be modified to some extent, but human nature cannot be\r\nchanged. There is a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this\r\nnation, which cast at least a million and a half of votes. You cannot\r\ndestroy that judgment and feeling--that sentiment--by breaking up the\r\npolitical organization which rallies around it. You can scarcely scatter\r\nand disperse an army which has been formed into order in the face of\r\nyour heaviest fire; but if you could, how much would you gain by forcing\r\nthe sentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of the\r\nballot-box into some other channel? What would that other channel\r\nprobably be? Would the number of John Browns be lessened or enlarged by\r\nthe operation?\r\n\r\nBut you will break up the Union rather than submit to a denial of your\r\nconstitutional rights.\r\n\r\nThat has a somewhat reckless sound; but it would be palliated, if not\r\nfully justified, were we proposing, by the mere force of numbers, to\r\ndeprive you of some right plainly written down in the Constitution. But\r\nwe are proposing no such thing.\r\n\r\nWhen you make these declarations you have a specific and well-understood\r\nallusion to an assumed constitutional right of yours to take slaves into\r\nthe Federal Territories, and to hold them there as property. But no such\r\nright is specifically written in the Constitution. That instrument is\r\nliterally silent about any such right. We, on the contrary, deny that\r\nsuch a right has any existence in the Constitution, even by implication.\r\n\r\nYour purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you will destroy the\r\ngovernment, unless you be allowed to construe and force the Constitution\r\nas you please, on all points in dispute between you and us. You will\r\nrule or ruin in all events.\r\n\r\nThis, plainly stated, is your language. Perhaps you will say the Supreme\r\nCourt has decided the disputed constitutional question in your favour.\r\nNot quite so. But waiving the lawyer\'s distinction between dictum and\r\ndecision, the court has decided the question for you in a sort of way.\r\nThe court has substantially said, it is your constitutional right to\r\ntake slaves into the Federal Territories, and to hold them there as\r\nproperty. When I say the decision was made in a sort of way, I mean it\r\nwas made in a divided court, by a bare majority of the judges, and they\r\nnot quite agreeing with one another in the reasons for making it; that\r\nit is so made as that its avowed supporters disagree with one another\r\nabout its meaning, and that it was mainly based upon a mistaken\r\nstatement of fact--the statement in the opinion that "the right of\r\nproperty in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the\r\nConstitution."\r\n\r\nAn inspection of the Constitution will show that the right of property\r\nin a slave is not "distinctly and expressly affirmed" in it. Bear in\r\nmind, the judges do not pledge their judicial opinion that such right is\r\nimpliedly affirmed in the Constitution; but they pledge their veracity\r\nthat it is "distinctly and expressly" affirmed there--"distinctly," that\r\nis, not mingled with anything else; "expressly," that is, in words\r\nmeaning just that, without the aid of any inference, and susceptible of\r\nno other meaning.\r\n\r\nIf they had only pledged their judicial opinion that such right is\r\naffirmed in the instrument by implication, it would be open to others to\r\nshow that neither the word "slave" nor "slavery" is to be found in the\r\nConstitution, nor the word "property," even, in any connection with\r\nlanguage alluding to the things slave or slavery; and that wherever in\r\nthat instrument the slave is alluded to, he is called a "person"; and\r\nwherever his master\'s legal right in relation to him is alluded to, it\r\nis spoken of as "service or labour which may be due"--as a debt payable\r\nin service or labour. Also it would be open to show, by contemporaneous\r\nhistory, that this mode of alluding to slaves and slavery, instead of\r\nspeaking of them, was employed on purpose to exclude from the\r\nConstitution the idea that there could be property in man.\r\n\r\nTo show all this is easy and certain.\r\n\r\nWhen this obvious mistake of the judges shall be brought to their\r\nnotice, is it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the\r\nmistaken statement, and reconsider the conclusion based upon it?\r\n\r\nAnd then it is to be remembered that "our fathers who framed\r\nthe government under which we live"--the men who made the\r\nConstitution--decided this same constitutional question in our favour\r\nlong ago; decided it without division among themselves when making the\r\ndecision; without division among themselves about the meaning of it\r\nafter it was made, and, so far as any evidence is left, without basing\r\nit upon any mistaken statement of facts.\r\n\r\nUnder all these circumstances, do you really feel yourselves justified\r\nto break up this government unless such a court decision as yours is\r\nshall be at once submitted to as a conclusive and final rule of\r\npolitical action? But you will not abide the election of a Republican\r\nPresident! In that supposed event, you say, you will destroy the Union;\r\nand then, you say, the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon\r\nus! That is cool. A highwayman holds a pistol to my ear, and mutters\r\nthrough his teeth, "Stand and deliver, or I shall kill you, and then you\r\nwill be a murderer!"\r\n\r\nTo be sure, what the robber demanded of me--my money--was my own; and I\r\nhad a clear right to keep it; but it was no more my own than my vote is\r\nmy own; and the threat of death to me, to extort my money, and the\r\nthreat of destruction to the Union, to extort my vote, can scarcely be\r\ndistinguished in principle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWrong as we think slavery is, we can yet afford to let it alone where it\r\nis, because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual\r\npresence in the nation; but can we, while our votes will prevent it,\r\nallow it to spread into the national Territories, and to overrun us here\r\nin these free States? If our sense of duty forbids this, then let us\r\nstand by our duty fearlessly and effectively. Let us be diverted by none\r\nof those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously\r\nplied and belaboured,--contrivances such as groping for some middle\r\nground between the right and the wrong, vain as the search for a man who\r\nshould be neither a living man nor a dead man; such as a policy of\r\n"don\'t care," on a question about which all true men do care; such as\r\nUnion appeals beseeching true Union men to yield to disunionists,\r\nreversing the Divine rule, and calling not the sinners, but the\r\nrighteous to repentance; such as invocations to Washington, imploring\r\nmen to unsay what Washington said, and undo what Washington did.\r\n\r\nNeither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against\r\nus, nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the government,\r\nnor of dungeons to ourselves. Let us have faith that right makes might,\r\nand in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lincoln\'s Farewell Address at Springfield, Illinois. February 11, 1861_\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Friends, No one not in my situation can appreciate my feeling of\r\nsadness at this parting. To this place, and the kindness of these\r\npeople, I owe everything. Here I have lived a quarter of a century, and\r\nhave passed from a young to an old man. Here my children have been born,\r\nand one is buried. I now leave, not knowing when or whether ever I may\r\nreturn, with a task before me greater than that which rested upon\r\nWashington. Without the assistance of that Divine Being who ever\r\nattended him I cannot succeed. With that assistance I cannot fail.\r\nTrusting in Him, who can go with me and remain with you, and be\r\neverywhere for good, let us confidently hope that all will yet be well.\r\nTo His care commending you, as I hope in your prayers you will commend\r\nme, I bid you an affectionate farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Letter to the Hon. Geo. Ashmun accepting his Nomination for the\r\nPresidency. May 23, 1860_\r\n\r\n\r\nI accept the nomination tendered me by the Convention over which you\r\npresided, and of which I am formally apprized in the letter of yourself\r\nand others, acting as a committee of the Convention for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe declaration of principles and sentiments which accompanies your\r\nletter, meets my approval; and it shall be my care not to violate or\r\ndisregard it in any part.\r\n\r\nImploring the assistance of Divine Providence, and with due regard to\r\nthe views and feelings of all who were represented in the Convention; to\r\nthe rights of all the States and Territories and people of the nation;\r\nto the inviolability of the Constitution; and the perpetual union,\r\nharmony, and prosperity of all,--I am most happy to co-operate for the\r\npractical success of the principles declared by the Convention.\r\n\r\n     Your obliged friend and fellow-citizen,\r\n       A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter to Miss Grace Bedell. Springfield, Illinois. October 19, 1860_\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear little Miss, Your very agreeable letter of the 15th is received.\r\nI regret the necessity of saying I have no daughter. I have three\r\nsons--one seventeen, one nine, and one seven years of age. They, with\r\ntheir mother, constitute my whole family. As to the whiskers, having\r\nnever worn any, do you not think people would call it a piece of silly\r\naffectation if I were to begin it now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From an Address to the Legislature at Indianapolis, Indiana. February\r\n12, 1861_\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens of the State of Indiana, I am here to thank you much for\r\nthis magnificent welcome, and still more for the generous support given\r\nby your State to that political cause which I think is the true and just\r\ncause of the whole country and the whole world.\r\n\r\nSolomon says "there is a time to keep silence," and when men wrangle by\r\nthe mouth with no certainty that they mean the same thing while using\r\nthe same word, it perhaps were as well if they would keep silence.\r\n\r\nThe words "coercion" and "invasion" are much used in these days, and\r\noften with some temper and hot blood. Let us make sure, if we can, that\r\nwe do not misunderstand the meaning of those who use them. Let us get\r\nexact definitions of these words, not from dictionaries, but from the\r\nmen themselves, who certainly deprecate the things they would represent\r\nby the use of words. What then is _coercion_? what is _invasion_? Would\r\nthe marching of an army into South Carolina, without the consent of her\r\npeople and with hostile intent towards them, be invasion? I certainly\r\nthink it would; and it would be coercion also, if the South Carolinians\r\nwere forced to submit. But if the United States should merely retake and\r\nhold its own forts and other property, and collect the duties on foreign\r\nimportations, or even withhold the mails from places where they were\r\nhabitually violated, would any or all these things be invasion or\r\ncoercion? Do our professed lovers of the Union, but who spitefully\r\nresolve that they will resist coercion and invasion, understand that\r\nsuch things as these, on the part of the United States, would be\r\ncoercion or invasion of a State? If so, their idea of means to preserve\r\nthe object of their affection would seem exceedingly thin and airy. If\r\nsick, the little pills of the homoeopathist would be much too large for\r\nthem to swallow. In their view, the Union as a family relation would\r\nseem to be no regular marriage, but a sort of free-love arrangement to\r\nbe maintained only on _passional attraction_.\r\n\r\nBy the way, in what consists the special sacredness of a State? I speak\r\nnot of the position assigned to a State in the Union by the\r\nConstitution; for that, by the bond, we all recognize. That position,\r\nhowever, a State cannot carry out of the Union with it. I speak of that\r\nassumed primary right of a State to rule all which is _less_ than\r\nitself, and ruin all which is larger than itself. If a State and a\r\ncounty in a given case should be equal in extent of territory, and equal\r\nin number of inhabitants, in what, as a matter of principle, is the\r\nState better than the county? Would an exchange of _names_ be an\r\nexchange of _rights_ upon principle? On what rightful principle may a\r\nState, being not more than one-fiftieth part of the nation in soil and\r\npopulation, break up the nation, and then coerce a proportionally larger\r\nsubdivision of itself in the most arbitrary way? What mysterious right\r\nto play tyrant is conferred on a district of country, with its people,\r\nby merely calling it a State?\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, I am not asserting anything: I am merely asking\r\nquestions for you to consider. And now allow me to bid you farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From his Address to the Legislature at Columbus, Ohio. February 13,\r\n1861_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is true, as has been said by the president of the Senate, that a very\r\ngreat responsibility rests upon me in the position to which the votes of\r\nthe American people have called me. I am deeply sensible of that weighty\r\nresponsibility. I cannot but know, what you all know, that without a\r\nname, perhaps without a reason why I should have a name, there has\r\nfallen upon me a task such as did not rest even upon the Father of his\r\nCountry; and so feeling, I cannot but turn and look for that support\r\nwithout which it will be impossible for me to perform that great task. I\r\nturn then, and look to the great American people, and to that God who\r\nhas never forsaken them. Allusion has been made to the interest felt in\r\nrelation to the policy of the new Administration. In this I have\r\nreceived from some a degree of credit for having kept silence, and from\r\nothers, some deprecation. I still think I was right.\r\n\r\nIn the varying and repeatedly shifting scenes of the present, and\r\nwithout a precedent which could enable me to judge by the past, it has\r\nseemed fitting that before speaking upon the difficulties of the\r\ncountry, I should have gained a view of the whole field, being at\r\nliberty to modify and change the course of policy as future events may\r\nmake a change necessary.\r\n\r\nI have not maintained silence from any want of real anxiety. It is a\r\ngood thing that there is no more than anxiety, for there is nothing\r\ngoing wrong. It is a consoling circumstance that when we look out, there\r\nis nothing that really hurts anybody. We entertain different views upon\r\npolitical questions, but nobody is suffering anything. This is a most\r\nconsoling circumstance, and from it we may conclude that all we want is\r\ntime, patience, and a reliance on that God who has never forsaken this\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From his Remarks at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. February 15, 1861_\r\n\r\n... The condition of the country is an extraordinary one, and fills the\r\nmind of every patriot with anxiety. It is my intention to give this\r\nsubject all the consideration I possibly can, before specially deciding\r\nin regard to it, so that when I do speak, it may be as nearly right as\r\npossible. When I do speak, I hope I may say nothing in opposition to the\r\nspirit of the Constitution, contrary to the integrity of the Union, or\r\nwhich will prove inimical to the liberties of the people or to the peace\r\nof the whole country. And furthermore, when the time arrives for me to\r\nspeak on this great subject, I hope I may say nothing to disappoint the\r\npeople generally throughout the country, especially if the expectation\r\nhas been based upon anything which I have heretofore said.\r\n\r\n... If the great American people only keep their temper on both sides of\r\nthe line, the troubles will come to an end, and the question which now\r\ndistracts the country will be settled, just as surely as all other\r\ndifficulties of a like character which have originated in this\r\ngovernment have been adjusted. Let the people on both sides keep their\r\nself-possession, and just as other clouds have cleared away in due time,\r\nso will this great nation continue to prosper as heretofore.\r\n\r\n... It is often said that the tariff is the specialty of Pennsylvania.\r\nAssuming that direct taxation is not to be adopted, the tariff question\r\nmust be as durable as the government itself. It is a question of\r\nnational house-keeping. It is to the government what replenishing the\r\nmeal-tub is to the family. Ever-varying circumstances will require\r\nfrequent modifications as to the amount needed and the sources of\r\nsupply. So far there is little difference of opinion among the people.\r\nIt is only whether, and how far, duties on imports shall be adjusted to\r\nfavour home productions. In the home market that controversy begins. One\r\nparty insists that too much protection oppresses one class for the\r\nadvantage of another; while the other party argues that, with all its\r\nincidents, in the long run all classes are benefited. In the Chicago\r\nplatform there is a plank upon this subject, which should be a general\r\nlaw to the incoming Administration. We should do neither more nor less\r\nthan we gave the people reason to believe we would when they gave us\r\ntheir votes. That plank is as I now read:\r\n\r\n     "That while providing revenue for the support of the general\r\n     government by duties upon imports, sound policy requires such an\r\n     adjustment of these imposts as will encourage the development of\r\n     the industrial interest of the whole country; and we commend that\r\n     policy of national exchanges which secures to working-men liberal\r\n     wages, to agriculture remunerating prices, to mechanics and\r\n     manufacturers adequate reward for their skill, labour, and\r\n     enterprise, and to the nation commercial prosperity and\r\n     independence."\r\n\r\n... My political education strongly inclines me against a very free use\r\nof any of the means by the Executive to control the legislation of the\r\ncountry. As a rule, I think it better that Congress should originate as\r\nwell as perfect its measures without external bias. I therefore would\r\nrather recommend to every gentleman who knows he is to be a member of\r\nthe next Congress, to take an enlarged view, and post himself\r\nthoroughly, so as to contribute his part to such an adjustment of the\r\ntariff as shall provide a sufficient revenue, and in its other bearings,\r\nso far as possible, be just and equal to all sections of the country and\r\nclasses of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From his Speech at Trenton to the Senate of New Jersey. February 21,\r\n1861_\r\n\r\n\r\n... I cannot but remember the place that New Jersey holds in our early\r\nhistory. In the early Revolutionary struggle few of the States among the\r\nold thirteen had more of the battle-fields of the country within their\r\nlimits than old New Jersey. May I be pardoned if, upon this occasion, I\r\nmention that away back in my childhood, the earliest days of my being\r\nable to read, I got hold of a small book, such a one as few of the\r\nyounger members have ever seen,--"Weems\'s Life of Washington." I\r\nremember all the accounts there given of the battle-fields and struggles\r\nfor the liberties of the country, and none fixed themselves upon my\r\nimagination so deeply as the struggle here at Trenton, New Jersey. The\r\ncrossing of the river, the contest with the Hessians, the great\r\nhardships endured at that time,--all fixed themselves upon my memory\r\nmore than any single Revolutionary event; and you all know, for you have\r\nall been boys, how those early impressions last longer than any others.\r\nI recollect thinking then, boy even though I was, that there must have\r\nbeen something more than common that these men struggled for. I am\r\nexceedingly anxious that that thing--that something even more than\r\nnational independence; that something that held out a great promise to\r\nall the people of the world for all time to come,--I am exceedingly\r\nanxious that this Union, the Constitution, and the liberties of the\r\npeople shall be perpetuated in accordance with the original idea for\r\nwhich the struggle was made, and I shall be most happy indeed if I shall\r\nbe an humble instrument in the hands of the Almighty, and of this, His\r\nmost chosen people, for perpetuating the object of that great struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Address in Independence Hall, Philadelphia. February 22, 1861_\r\n\r\n\r\nI am filled with deep emotion at finding myself standing in this place,\r\nwhere were collected together the wisdom, the patriotism, the devotion\r\nto principle, from which sprang the institutions under which we live.\r\n\r\nYou have kindly suggested to me that in my hands is the task of\r\nrestoring peace to our distracted country. I can say in return, sir,\r\nthat all the political sentiments I entertain have been drawn, so far as\r\nI have been able to draw them, from the sentiments which originated in\r\nand were given to the world from this hall. I have never had a feeling,\r\npolitically, that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nI have often pondered over the dangers which were incurred by the men\r\nwho assembled here and framed and adopted that Declaration. I have\r\npondered over the toils that were endured by the officers and soldiers\r\nof the army who achieved that independence. I have often inquired of\r\nmyself what great principle or idea it was that kept this Confederacy so\r\nlong together. It was not the mere matter of separation of the colonies\r\nfrom the motherland, but that sentiment in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence which gave liberty not alone to the people of this country,\r\nbut hope to all the world, for all future time. It was that which gave\r\npromise that in due time the weights would be lifted from the shoulders\r\nof all men, and that all should have an equal chance. This is the\r\nsentiment embodied in the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nNow, my friends, can this country be saved on that basis? If it can, I\r\nwill consider myself one of the happiest men in the world if I can help\r\nto save it. If it cannot be saved upon that principle, it will be truly\r\nawful. But if this country cannot be saved without giving up that\r\nprinciple, I was about to say I would rather be assassinated on this\r\nspot than surrender it.\r\n\r\nNow, in my view of the present aspect of affairs, there is no need of\r\nbloodshed and war. There is no necessity for it. I am not in favour of\r\nsuch a course; and I may say in advance that there will be no bloodshed\r\nunless it is forced upon the government. The government will not use\r\nforce unless force is used against it.\r\n\r\nMy friends, this is wholly an unprepared speech. I did not expect to be\r\ncalled on to say a word when I came here. I supposed I was merely to do\r\nsomething toward raising a flag. I may, therefore, have said something\r\nindiscreet. But I have said nothing but what I am willing to live by,\r\nand, if it be the pleasure of Almighty God, to die by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reply to the Mayor of Washington, D.C. February 27, 1861_\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Mayor, I thank you, and through you the municipal authorities of\r\nthis city who accompany you, for this welcome. And as it is the first\r\ntime in my life, since the present phase of politics has presented\r\nitself in this country, that I have said anything publicly within a\r\nregion of country where the institution of slavery exists, I will take\r\nthis occasion to say that I think very much of the ill-feeling that has\r\nexisted and still exists between the people in the section from which I\r\ncame and the people here, is dependent upon a misunderstanding of one\r\nanother. I therefore avail myself of this opportunity to assure you, Mr.\r\nMayor, and all the gentlemen present, that I have not now, and never\r\nhave had, any other than as kindly feelings towards you as to the people\r\nof my own section. I have not now and never have had any disposition to\r\ntreat you in any respect otherwise than as my own neighbours. I have not\r\nnow any purpose to withhold from you any of the benefits of the\r\nConstitution under any circumstances, that I would not feel myself\r\nconstrained to withhold from my own neighbours; and I hope, in a word,\r\nthat when we become better acquainted,--and I say it with great\r\nconfidence,--we shall like each other the more. I thank you for the\r\nkindness of this reception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_First Inaugural Address. March 4, 1861_\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens of the United States, In compliance with a custom as old\r\nas the government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly,\r\nand to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the Constitution of\r\nthe United States to be taken by the President "before he enters on the\r\nexecution of his office."\r\n\r\nI do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those\r\nmatters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nApprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that\r\nby the accession of a Republican administration their property and their\r\npeace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been\r\nany reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample\r\nevidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to\r\ntheir inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of\r\nhim who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches\r\nwhen I declare that "I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to\r\ninterfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists.\r\nI believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to\r\ndo so." Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge\r\nthat I had made this and many similar declarations, and had never\r\nrecanted them. And, more than this, they placed in the platform for my\r\nacceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic\r\nresolution which I now read:--\r\n\r\n     "_Resolved_, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the\r\n     States, and especially the right of each State to order and control\r\n     its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment\r\n     exclusively, is essential to that balance of power on which the\r\n     perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend, and we\r\n     denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any\r\n     State or Territory, no matter under what pretext, as among the\r\n     gravest of crimes."\r\n\r\nI now reiterate these sentiments; and, in doing so, I only press upon\r\nthe public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is\r\nsusceptible, that the property, peace, and security of no section are to\r\nbe in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration. I add,\r\ntoo, that all the protection which, consistently with the Constitution\r\nand the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given to all the States\r\nwhen lawfully demanded, for whatever cause--as cheerfully to one section\r\nas to another.\r\n\r\nThere is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from\r\nservice or labour. The clause I now read is as plainly written in the\r\nConstitution as any other of its provisions:--\r\n\r\n     "No person held to service or labour in one State, under the laws\r\n     thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or\r\n     regulation therein be discharged from such service or labour, but\r\n     shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or\r\n     labour may be due."\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who\r\nmade it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the\r\nintention of the lawgiver is the law. All members of Congress swear\r\ntheir support to the whole Constitution--to this provision as much as to\r\nany other. To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within\r\nthe terms of this clause "shall be delivered up," their oaths are\r\nunanimous. Now, if they would make the effort in good temper, could they\r\nnot with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which\r\nto keep good that unanimous oath?\r\n\r\nThere is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be\r\nenforced by national or by State authority; but surely that difference\r\nis not a very material one. If the slave is to be surrendered, it can be\r\nof but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is\r\ndone. And should any one in any case be content that his oath shall go\r\nunkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be\r\nkept?\r\n\r\nAgain, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the safeguards of\r\nliberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced, so\r\nthat a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as a slave? And might\r\nit not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of\r\nthat clause in the Constitution which guarantees that "the citizen of\r\neach State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of\r\ncitizens in the several States"?\r\n\r\nI take the official oath to-day with no mental reservations, and with no\r\npurpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules.\r\nAnd while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as\r\nproper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much safer for all,\r\nboth in official and private stations, to conform to and abide by all\r\nthose acts which stand unrepealed, than to violate any of them, trusting\r\nto find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nIt is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President\r\nunder our National Constitution. During that period fifteen different\r\nand greatly distinguished citizens have, in succession, administered the\r\nexecutive branch of the government They have conducted it through many\r\nperils, and generally with great success. Yet, with all this scope of\r\nprecedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional\r\nterm of four years under great and peculiar difficulty. A disruption of\r\nthe Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.\r\n\r\nI hold that, in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution,\r\nthe Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not\r\nexpressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is\r\nsafe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its\r\norganic law for its own termination. Continue to execute all the express\r\nprovisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will endure for\r\never--it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not\r\nprovided for in the instrument itself.\r\n\r\nAgain, if the United States be not a government proper, but an\r\nassociation of States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a\r\ncontract, be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?\r\nOne party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak; but does\r\nit not require all to lawfully rescind it?\r\n\r\nDescending from these general principles, we find the proposition that\r\nin legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by the history\r\nof the Union itself. The Union is much older than the Constitution. It\r\nwas formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774. It was\r\nmatured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was\r\nfurther matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly\r\nplighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of\r\nConfederation in 1778. And, finally, in 1787 one of the declared objects\r\nfor ordaining and establishing the Constitution was "to form a more\r\nperfect Union."\r\n\r\nBut if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the\r\nStates be lawfully possible, the Union is less perfect than before the\r\nConstitution, having lost the vital element of perpetuity.\r\n\r\nIt follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion can\r\nlawfully get out of the Union; that resolves and ordinances to that\r\neffect are legally void; and that acts of violence, within any State or\r\nStates, against the authority of the United States, are insurrectionary\r\nor revolutionary, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nI therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws, the\r\nUnion is unbroken; and to the extent of my ability I shall take care, as\r\nthe Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the\r\nUnion be faithfully executed in all the States. Doing this I deem to be\r\nonly a simple duty on my part; and I shall perform it so far as\r\npracticable, unless my rightful masters, the American people, shall\r\nwithhold the requisite means, or in some authoritative manner direct the\r\ncontrary. I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the\r\ndeclared purpose of the Union that it will constitutionally defend and\r\nmaintain itself.\r\n\r\nIn doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence; and there\r\nshall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority. The\r\npower confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the\r\nproperty and places belonging to the government, and to collect the\r\nduties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects,\r\nthere will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people\r\nanywhere. Where hostility to the United States, in any interior\r\nlocality, shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent\r\nresident citizens from holding the Federal offices, there will be no\r\nattempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object.\r\nWhile the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the\r\nexercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating,\r\nand so nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better to forego for\r\nthe time the uses of such offices.\r\n\r\nThe mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts\r\nof the Union. So far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that\r\nsense of perfect security which is most favourable to calm thought and\r\nreflection. The course here indicated will be followed unless current\r\nevents and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,\r\nand in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised\r\naccording to circumstances actually existing, and with a view and a hope\r\nof a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of\r\nfraternal sympathies and affections.\r\n\r\nThat there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the\r\nUnion at all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will\r\nneither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word to\r\nthem. To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our\r\nnational fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes,\r\nwould it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it? Will you\r\nhazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any\r\nportion of the ills you fly from have no real existence? Will you,\r\nwhile the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you\r\nfly from--will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake?\r\n\r\nAll profess to be content in the Union if all constitutional rights can\r\nbe maintained. Is it true, then, that any right, plainly written in the\r\nConstitution, has been denied? I think not. Happily the human mind is so\r\nconstituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this.\r\nThink, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written\r\nprovision of the Constitution has ever been denied. If by the mere force\r\nof numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written\r\nconstitutional right, it might, in a moral point of view, justify\r\nrevolution--certainly would if such a right were a vital one. But such\r\nis not our case. All the vital rights of minorities and of individuals\r\nare so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations, guaranties\r\nand prohibitions, in the Constitution, that controversies never arise\r\nconcerning them. But no organic law can ever be framed with a provision\r\nspecifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical\r\nadministration. No foresight can anticipate, nor any document of\r\nreasonable length contain, express provisions for all possible\r\nquestions. Shall fugitives from labour be surrendered by national or by\r\nState authority? The Constitution does not expressly say. _May_ Congress\r\nprohibit slavery in the Territories? The Constitution does not expressly\r\nsay. _Must_ Congress protect slavery in the Territories? The\r\nConstitution does not expressly say.\r\n\r\nFrom questions of this class spring all our constitutional\r\ncontroversies, and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.\r\nIf the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the government\r\nmust cease. There is no other alternative; for continuing the government\r\nis acquiescence on one side or the other.\r\n\r\nIf a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce, they make\r\na precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them; for a minority of\r\ntheir own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be\r\ncontrolled by such minority. For instance, why may not any portion of a\r\nnew confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again, precisely\r\nas portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it? All who\r\ncherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper\r\nof doing this.\r\n\r\nIs there such perfect identity of interests among the States to compose\r\na new Union, as to produce harmony only, and prevent renewed secession?\r\n\r\nPlainly, the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy. A\r\nmajority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and\r\nalways changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and\r\nsentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects\r\nit does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is\r\nimpossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is\r\nwholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy\r\nor despotism in some form is all that is left.\r\n\r\nI do not forget the position, assumed by some, that constitutional\r\nquestions are to be decided by the Supreme Court; nor do I deny that\r\nsuch decisions must be binding, in any case, upon the parties to a suit,\r\nas to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled to very high\r\nrespect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments\r\nof the government. And while it is obviously possible that such decision\r\nmay be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it,\r\nbeing limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be\r\noverruled and never become a precedent for other cases, can better be\r\nborne than could the evils of a different practice. At the same time,\r\nthe candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government,\r\nupon vital questions affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably\r\nfixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made, in\r\nordinary litigation between parties in personal actions, the people will\r\nhave ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically\r\nresigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal. Nor\r\nis there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges. It is a\r\nduty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought\r\nbefore them, and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their\r\ndecisions to political purposes.\r\n\r\nOne section of our country believes slavery is right, and ought to be\r\nextended, while the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be\r\nextended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive-slave\r\nclause of the Constitution, and the law for the suppression of the\r\nforeign slave-trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can\r\never be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly\r\nsupports the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the dry\r\nlegal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I\r\nthink, cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases\r\nafter the separation of the sections than before. The foreign\r\nslave-trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived,\r\nwithout restriction, in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only\r\npartially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other.\r\n\r\nPhysically speaking, we cannot separate. We cannot remove our respective\r\nsections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. A\r\nhusband and wife may be divorced, and go out of the presence and beyond\r\nthe reach of each other; but the different parts of our country cannot\r\ndo this. They cannot but remain face to face, and intercourse, either\r\namicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible, then,\r\nto make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after\r\nseparation than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can\r\nmake laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than\r\nlaws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always;\r\nand when, after much loss on both sides, and no gain on either, you\r\ncease fighting, the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse\r\nare again upon you.\r\n\r\nThis country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit\r\nit. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can\r\nexercise their constitutional right of amending it, or their\r\nrevolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it. I cannot be ignorant\r\nof the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of\r\nhaving the National Constitution amended. While I make no recommendation\r\nof amendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the people\r\nover the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes\r\nprescribed in the instrument itself; and I should, under existing\r\ncircumstances, favour rather than oppose a fair opportunity being\r\nafforded the people to act upon it. I will venture to add that to me the\r\nconvention mode seems preferable, in that it allows amendments to\r\noriginate with the people themselves, instead of only permitting them to\r\ntake or reject propositions originated by others not especially chosen\r\nfor the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they would\r\nwish to either accept or refuse. I understand a proposed amendment to\r\nthe Constitution--which amendment, however, I have not seen--has passed\r\nCongress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall never\r\ninterfere with the domestic institutions of the States, including that\r\nof persons held to service. To avoid misconstruction of what I have\r\nsaid, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments so\r\nfar as to say that, holding such a provision to now be implied\r\nconstitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and\r\nirrevocable.\r\n\r\nThe chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and they\r\nhave conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the\r\nStates. The people themselves can do this also if they choose; but the\r\nExecutive, as such, has nothing to do with it. His duty is to administer\r\nthe present government, as it came to his hands, and to transmit it,\r\nunimpaired by him, to his successor.\r\n\r\nWhy should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of\r\nthe people? Is there any better or equal hope in the world? In our\r\npresent differences, is either party without faith of being in the\r\nright? If the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with his eternal truth and\r\njustice, be on your side of the North, or on yours of the South, that\r\ntruth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great\r\ntribunal of the American people.\r\n\r\nBy the frame of the government under which we live, this same people\r\nhave wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief;\r\nand have, with equal wisdom, provided for the return of that little to\r\ntheir own hands at very short intervals. While the people retain their\r\nvirtue and vigilance, no administration, by any extreme of wickedness or\r\nfolly, can very seriously injure the government in the short space of\r\nfour years.\r\n\r\nMy countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well upon this whole\r\nsubject. Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time. If there be an\r\nobject to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never\r\ntake deliberately, that object will be frustrated by taking time; but no\r\ngood object can be frustrated by it. Such of you as are now dissatisfied\r\nstill have the old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point,\r\nthe laws of your own framing under it; while the new administration will\r\nhave no immediate power, if it would, to change either. If it were\r\nadmitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the\r\ndispute, there still is no single good reason for precipitate action.\r\nIntelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who\r\nhas never yet forsaken this favoured land, are still competent to adjust\r\nin the best way all our present difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is\r\nthe momentous issue of civil war. The government will not assail you.\r\nYou can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. You\r\nhave no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government, while I\r\nshall have the most solemn one to "preserve, protect, and defend it."\r\n\r\nI am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be\r\nenemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds\r\nof affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every\r\nbattle-field and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all\r\nover this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again\r\ntouched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Address at Utica, New York. February 18, 1861_\r\n\r\n\r\nLadies and Gentlemen, I have no speech to make to you, and no time to\r\nspeak in. I appear before you that I may see you, and that you may see\r\nme; and I am willing to admit, that, so far as the ladies are concerned,\r\nI have the best of the bargain, though I wish it to be understood that I\r\ndo not make the same acknowledgment concerning the men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From his First Message to Congress, at the Special Session. July 4,\r\n1861_\r\n\r\n\r\n... It is thus seen that the assault upon and reduction of Fort Sumter\r\nwas in no sense a matter of self-defence on the part of the assailants.\r\nThey well knew that the garrison in the fort could by no possibility\r\ncommit aggression upon them. They knew--they were expressly\r\nnotified--that the giving of bread to the few brave and hungry men of\r\nthe garrison was all which would on that occasion be attempted, unless\r\nthemselves, by resisting so much, should provoke more. They knew that\r\nthis government desired to keep the garrison in the fort, not to assail\r\nthem, but merely to maintain visible possession, and thus to preserve\r\nthe Union from actual and immediate dissolution,--trusting, as\r\nhereinbefore stated, to time, discussion, and the ballot-box, for final\r\nadjustment; and they assailed and reduced the fort for precisely the\r\nreverse object,--to drive out the visible authority of the Federal\r\nUnion, and thus force it to immediate dissolution....\r\n\r\nThat this was their object the Executive well understood; and having\r\nsaid to them in the inaugural address, "You can have no conflict without\r\nbeing yourselves the aggressors," he took pains not only to keep this\r\ndeclaration good, but also to keep the case so free from the power of\r\ningenious sophistry that the world should not be able to misunderstand\r\nit....\r\n\r\nBy the affair at Fort Sumter, with its surrounding circumstances, that\r\npoint was reached. Then and thereby the assailants of the government\r\nbegan the conflict of arms, without a gun in sight, or in expectancy to\r\nreturn their fire, save only the few in the fort sent to that harbour\r\nyears before for their own protection, and still ready to give that\r\nprotection in whatever was lawful. In this act, discarding all else,\r\nthey have forced upon the country the distinct issue, "immediate\r\ndissolution or blood."\r\n\r\nAnd this issue embraces more than the fate of these United States. It\r\npresents to the whole family of man the question whether a\r\nconstitutional republic or democracy--a government of the people by the\r\nsame people--can or cannot maintain its territorial integrity against\r\nits own domestic foes. It presents the question whether discontented\r\nindividuals, too few in numbers to control administration according to\r\norganic law in any case, can always, upon the pretences made in this\r\ncase or any other pretences, or arbitrarily without any pretence, break\r\nup their government, and thus practically put an end to free government\r\nupon the earth. It forces us to ask: "Is there, in all republics, this\r\ninherent and fatal weakness?" "Must a government, of necessity, be too\r\nstrong for the liberties of its own people, or too weak to maintain its\r\nown existence?"\r\n\r\nSo viewing the issue, no choice was left but to call out the war power\r\nof the government, and so to resist force employed for its destruction\r\nby force for its preservation.\r\n\r\nThe call was made, and the response of the country was most gratifying,\r\nsurpassing in unanimity and spirit the most sanguine expectation.\r\n\r\n... The people of Virginia have thus allowed this giant insurrection to\r\nmake its nest within her borders,--and this government has no choice\r\nleft but to deal with it where it finds it. And it has the less regret,\r\nas the loyal citizens have in due form claimed its protection. Those\r\nloyal citizens this government is bound to recognize and protect, as\r\nbeing Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn the border States, so called,--in fact, the Middle States,--there are\r\nthose who favour a policy which they call "armed neutrality;" that is,\r\nan arming of those States to prevent the Union forces passing one way,\r\nor the disunion the other, over their soil. This would be disunion\r\ncompleted. Figuratively speaking, it would be the building of an\r\nimpassable wall along the line of separation,--and yet not quite an\r\nimpassable one, for under the guise of neutrality, it would tie the\r\nhands of Union men, and freely pass supplies from among them to the\r\ninsurrectionists, which it could not do as an open enemy. At a stroke,\r\nit would take all the trouble off the hands of secession, except only\r\nwhat proceeds from the external blockade. It would do for the\r\ndisunionists that which of all things they most desire,--feed them well\r\nand give them disunion without a struggle of their own. It recognizes no\r\nfidelity to the Constitution, no obligation to maintain the Union; and\r\nwhile very many who have favoured it are doubtless loyal citizens, it\r\nis, nevertheless, very injurious in effect.\r\n\r\n... The forbearance of this government had been so extraordinary and so\r\nlong continued, as to lead some foreign nations to shape their action as\r\nif they supposed the early destruction of our National Union was\r\nprobable. While this, on discovery, gave the Executive some concern, he\r\nis now happy to say that the sovereignty and rights of the United States\r\nare now everywhere practically respected by foreign powers, and a\r\ngeneral sympathy with the country is manifested throughout the world.\r\n\r\n... It is now recommended that you give the legal means for making this\r\ncontest a short and decisive one; that you place at the control of the\r\ngovernment for the work, at least four hundred thousand men, and\r\n$400,000,000. That number of men is about one-tenth of those of proper\r\nages within the regions where, apparently, all are willing to engage;\r\nand the sum is less than a twenty-third part of the money value owned by\r\nthe men who seem ready to devote the whole.\r\n\r\n... A right result at this time, will be worth more to the world than\r\nten times the men and ten times the money. The evidences reaching us\r\nfrom the country leaves no doubt that the material for the work is\r\nabundant, and that it needs only the hand of legislation to give it\r\nlegal sanction, and the hand of the Executive to give it practical shape\r\nand efficiency. One of the greatest perplexities of the government is to\r\navoid receiving troops faster than it can provide for them. In a word,\r\nthe people will save their government, if the government itself will do\r\nits part only indifferently well.\r\n\r\nIt might seem at first thought to be of little difference whether the\r\npresent movement at the South be called _secession_ or _rebellion_. The\r\nmovers, however, well understand the difference. At the beginning they\r\nknew they could never raise their treason to any respectable magnitude\r\nby any name which implies violation of law. They knew their people\r\npossessed as much of moral sense, as much of devotion to law and order,\r\nand as much pride in and reverence for the history and government of\r\ntheir common country as any other civilized and patriotic people. They\r\nknew they could make no advancement directly in the teeth of these\r\nstrong and noble sentiments. Accordingly, they commenced by an insidious\r\ndebauching of the public mind. They invented an ingenious sophism which,\r\nif conceded, was followed by perfectly logical steps, through all the\r\nincidents, to the complete destruction of the Union. The sophism itself\r\nis that any State of the Union may consistently with the national\r\nConstitution, and therefore lawfully and peacefully, withdraw from the\r\nUnion without the consent of the Union or of any other State. The little\r\ndisguise that the supposed right is to be exercised only for just\r\ncause, themselves to be the sole judges of its justice, is too thin to\r\nmerit any notice.\r\n\r\nWith rebellion thus _sugar-coated_ they have been drugging the public\r\nmind of their section for more than thirty years, and until at length\r\nthey have brought many good men to a willingness to take up arms against\r\nthe government the day after some assemblage of men have enacted the\r\nfarcical pretence of taking their State out of the Union, who could have\r\nbeen brought to no such thing the day before.\r\n\r\nThis sophism derives much, perhaps the whole of its currency from the\r\nassumption that there is some omnipotent and sacred supremacy pertaining\r\nto a State--to each State of our Federal Union. Our States have neither\r\nmore nor less power than that reserved to them in the Union by the\r\nConstitution, no one of them ever having been a State out of the Union.\r\nThe original ones passed into the Union even before they cast off their\r\nBritish colonial dependence, and the new ones each came into the Union\r\ndirectly from a condition of dependence, excepting Texas. And even Texas\r\nin its temporary independence was never designated a State. The new ones\r\nonly took the designation of States on coming into the Union, while that\r\nname was first adopted for the old ones in and by the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. Therein the "United Colonies" were declared to be "free\r\nand independent States;" but even then the object plainly was, not to\r\ndeclare their independence of one another or of the Union, but directly\r\nthe contrary, as their mutual pledges and their mutual action before, at\r\nthe time, and afterward abundantly show. The express plighting of faith\r\nby each and all of the original thirteen in the Articles of\r\nConfederation two years later, that the Union shall be perpetual, is\r\nmost conclusive. Having never been States, either in substance or name,\r\noutside of the Union, whence this magical omnipotence of "State-Rights,"\r\nasserting a claim of power to lawfully destroy the Union itself? Much is\r\nsaid about the "sovereignty" of the States; but the word is not in the\r\nNational Constitution, nor, as is believed, in any of the State\r\nconstitutions. What is _sovereignty_ in the political sense of the term?\r\nWould it be far wrong to define it "a political community without a\r\npolitical superior?" Tested by this, no one of our States, except Texas,\r\never was a sovereignty. And even Texas gave up the character on coming\r\ninto the Union, by which act she acknowledged the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, and the laws and treaties of the United States made in\r\npursuance of the Constitution, to be for her the supreme law of the\r\nland. The States have their status in the Union, and they have no other\r\nlegal status. If they break from this, they can only do so against law\r\nand by revolution. The Union, and not themselves separately, procured\r\ntheir independence and their liberty. By conquest or purchase, the Union\r\ngave each of them whatever of independence or liberty it has. The Union\r\nis older than any of the States, and, in fact, it created them as\r\nStates. Originally some dependent colonies made the Union, and in turn\r\nthe Union threw off their old dependence for them, and made them States,\r\nsuch as they are. Not one of them ever had a State constitution\r\nindependent of the Union. Of course it is not forgotten that all the new\r\nStates framed their constitutions before they entered the\r\nUnion,--nevertheless, dependent upon and preparatory to coming into the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the States have the powers and the rights reserved to\r\nthem in and by the National Constitution; but among these, surely, are\r\nnot included all conceivable powers, however mischievous or destructive;\r\nbut, at most, such only as were known in the world at the time, as\r\ngovernmental powers; and, certainly, a power to destroy the government\r\nitself had never been known as a governmental--as a merely\r\nadministrative power. This relative matter of National power and States\r\nrights, as a principle, is no other than the principle of generality and\r\nlocality. Whatever concerns the whole world should be confided to the\r\nwhole--to the General Government; while whatever concerns only the\r\nState should be left exclusively to the State. This is all there is of\r\noriginal principle about it.... What is now combated, is the position\r\nthat secession is consistent with the Constitution--is lawful and\r\npeaceful. It is not contended that there is any express law for it; and\r\nnothing should ever be implied as law which leads to unjust or absurd\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nThe nation purchased with money the countries out of which several of\r\nthese States were formed; is it just that they shall go off without\r\nleave and without refunding? The nation paid very large sums (in the\r\naggregate, I believe, nearly a hundred millions) to relieve Florida of\r\nthe aboriginal tribes; is it just that she shall now be off without\r\nconsent, or without making any return? The nation is now in debt for\r\nmoney applied to the benefit of these so-called seceding States in\r\ncommon with the rest; is it just that the creditors shall go unpaid, or\r\nthe remaining States pay the whole?... Again, if one State may secede,\r\nso may another; and when all shall have seceded, none is left to pay the\r\ndebts. Is this quite just to the creditors? Did we notify them of this\r\nsage view of ours when we borrowed their money? If we now recognize this\r\ndoctrine by allowing the seceders to go in peace, it is difficult to see\r\nwhat we can do if others choose to go, or to extort terms upon which\r\nthey will promise to remain.\r\n\r\nThe seceders insist that our Constitution admits of secession. They have\r\nassumed to make a national constitution of their own, in which, of\r\nnecessity, they have either discarded or retained the right of\r\nsecession, as they insist it exists in ours. If they have discarded it,\r\nthey thereby admit that, on principle, it ought not to be in ours. If\r\nthey have retained it, by their own construction of ours, they show that\r\nto be consistent they must secede from one another whenever they shall\r\nfind it the easiest way of settling their debts, or effecting any other\r\nor selfish or unjust object. The principle itself is one of\r\ndisintegration, and upon which no government can stand.\r\n\r\nIf all the States save one should assert the power to drive that one out\r\nof the Union, it is presumed the whole class of seceder politicians\r\nwould at once deny the power, and denounce the act as the greatest\r\noutrage upon State rights. But suppose that precisely the same act,\r\ninstead of being called "driving the one out," should be called "the\r\nseceding of the others from that one," it would be exactly what the\r\nseceders claim to do; unless, indeed, they make the point that the one,\r\nbecause it is a minority, may rightfully do what the others, because\r\nthey are a majority, may not rightfully do....\r\n\r\nIt may be affirmed without extravagance that the free institutions we\r\nenjoy have developed the powers and improved the condition of our whole\r\npeople, beyond any example in the world. Of this we now have a striking\r\nand an impressive illustration. So large an army as the government has\r\nnow on foot was never before known, without a soldier in it but who has\r\ntaken his place there of his own free choice. But more than this, there\r\nare many single regiments, whose members, one and another, possess full\r\npractical knowledge of all the arts, sciences, and professions, and\r\nwhatever else, whether useful or elegant, is known in the world; and\r\nthere is scarcely one from which there could not be selected a\r\nPresident, a cabinet, a congress, and perhaps a court, abundantly\r\ncompetent to administer the government itself. Nor do I say that this is\r\nnot true also in the army of our late friends, now adversaries in this\r\ncontest; but if it is, so much the better reason why the government\r\nwhich has conferred such benefits on both them and us should not be\r\nbroken up. Whoever in any section proposes to abandon such a government,\r\nwould do well to consider in deference to what principle it is that he\r\ndoes it; what better he is likely to get in its stead; whether the\r\nsubstitute will give, or be intended to give, so much of good to the\r\npeople? There are some foreshadowings on this subject. Our adversaries\r\nhave adopted some declarations of independence in which, unlike the good\r\nold one penned by Jefferson, they omit the words, "all men are created\r\nequal." Why? They have adopted a temporary national constitution, in\r\nthe preamble of which, unlike our good old one signed by Washington,\r\nthey omit "We, the people," and substitute "We, the deputies of the\r\nsovereign and independent States." Why? Why this deliberate pressing out\r\nof view the rights of men and the authority of the people?\r\n\r\nThis is essentially a people\'s contest. On the side of the Union it is a\r\nstruggle for maintaining in the world that form and substance of\r\ngovernment whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men,--to\r\nlift artificial weights from all shoulders, to clear the paths of\r\nlaudable pursuit for all, to afford all an unfettered start and a fair\r\nchance in the race of life. Yielding to partial and temporary departures\r\nfrom necessity, this is the leading object of the government for the\r\nexistence of which we contend.\r\n\r\nI am most happy to believe that the plain people understand and\r\nappreciate this. It is worthy of note that while in this, the\r\ngovernment\'s hour of trial, large numbers of those in the army and navy\r\nwho have been favoured with the offices have resigned and proved false\r\nto the hand which had pampered them, not one common soldier or common\r\nsailor is known to have deserted his flag.\r\n\r\nOur popular government has often been called an experiment. Two points\r\nin it our people have already settled,--the successful establishing and\r\nthe successful administering of it. One still remains,--its successful\r\nmaintenance against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow it. It is\r\nnow for them to demonstrate to the world that those who can fairly carry\r\nan election can also suppress a rebellion; that ballots are the rightful\r\nand peaceful successors of bullets; and that when ballots have fairly\r\nand constitutionally decided, there can be no successful appeal back to\r\nbullets; that there can be no successful appeal, except to ballots\r\nthemselves, at succeeding elections. Such will be a great lesson of\r\npeace; teaching men that what they cannot take by an election, neither\r\ncan they take by a war; teaching all the folly of being the beginners of\r\na war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From his Message to Congress at its Regular Session. December 3, 1861_\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives, In the midst\r\nof unprecedented political troubles, we have cause of great gratitude to\r\nGod for unusual good health and abundant harvests.\r\n\r\nYou will not be surprised to learn that in the peculiar exigencies of\r\nthe times, our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with\r\nprofound solicitude, chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs.\r\n\r\nA disloyal portion of the American people have, during the whole year,\r\nbeen engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A nation\r\nwhich endures factious domestic division is exposed to disrespect\r\nabroad; and one party, if not both, is sure, sooner or later, to invoke\r\nforeign intervention. Nations thus tempted to interfere are not always\r\nable to resist the counsels of seeming expediency and ungenerous\r\nambition, although measures adopted under such influences seldom fail to\r\nbe injurious and unfortunate to those adopting them.\r\n\r\nThe disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of\r\nour country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked\r\nabroad, have received less patronage and encouragement than they\r\nprobably expected. If it were just to suppose, as the insurgents have\r\nseemed to assume, that foreign nations in this case, discarding all\r\nmoral, social, and treaty obligations, would act solely and selfishly\r\nfor the most speedy restoration of commerce, including especially the\r\nacquisition of cotton, those nations appear as yet not to have seen\r\ntheir way to their object more directly or clearly through the\r\ndestruction than through the preservation of the Union. If we could dare\r\nto believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher principle than\r\nthis, I am quite sure a sound argument could be made to show them that\r\nthey can reach their aim more readily and easily by aiding to crush\r\nthis rebellion than by giving encouragement to it.\r\n\r\nThe principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting foreign\r\nnations to hostility against us, as already intimated, is the\r\nembarrassment of commerce. Those nations, however, not improbably saw\r\nfrom the first that it was the Union which made as well our foreign as\r\nour domestic commerce. They can scarcely have failed to perceive that\r\nthe effort for disunion produces the existing difficulty; and that one\r\nstrong nation promises a more durable peace and a more extensive,\r\nvaluable, and reliable commerce than can the same nation broken into\r\nhostile fragments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if not\r\nexclusively, a war upon the first principle of popular government,--the\r\nrights of the people. Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most\r\ngrave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in the\r\ngeneral tone of the insurgents. In those documents we find the\r\nabridgment of the existing right of suffrage, and the denial to the\r\npeople of all right to participate in the selection of public officers,\r\nexcept the legislative, boldly advocated, with laboured arguments to\r\nprove that large control of the people in government is the source of\r\nall political evil. Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at, as a\r\npossible refuge from the power of the people.\r\n\r\nIn my present position, I could scarcely be justified were I to omit\r\nraising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism.\r\n\r\nIt is not needed nor fitting here that a general argument should be made\r\nin favour of popular institutions; but there is one point, with its\r\nconnections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask a brief\r\nattention. It is the effort to place capital on an equal footing with,\r\nif not above, labour, in the structure of government. It is assumed that\r\nlabour is available only in connection with capital; that nobody\r\nlabours, unless somebody else, owning capital, somehow, by the use of\r\nit, induces him to labour. This assumed, it is next considered whether\r\nit is best that capital shall hire labourers, and thus induce them to\r\nwork by their own consent, or buy them and drive them to it without\r\ntheir consent. Having proceeded thus far, it is naturally concluded that\r\nall labourers are either hired labourers, or what we call slaves. And\r\nfurther, it is assumed that whoever is once a hired labourer is fixed in\r\nthat condition for life.\r\n\r\nNow, there is no such relation between capital and labour as assumed,\r\nnor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life in the\r\ncondition of a hired labourer. Both these assumptions are false, and all\r\ninferences from them are groundless.\r\n\r\nLabour is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit\r\nof labour, and could never have existed if labour had not first existed.\r\nLabour is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher\r\nconsideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection\r\nas any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always\r\nwill be, a relation between labour and capital, producing mutual\r\nbenefits. The error is in assuming that the whole labour of the\r\ncommunity exists within that relation. A few men own capital, and that\r\nfew avoid labour themselves, and with their capital hire or buy another\r\nfew to labour for them. A large majority belong to neither\r\nclass,--neither work for others, nor have others working for them. In\r\nmost of the Southern States, a majority of the whole people, of all\r\ncolours, are neither slaves nor masters; while in the Northern, a\r\nmajority are neither hirers nor hired. Men with their families--wives,\r\nsons, and daughters--work for themselves, on their farms, in their\r\nhouses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and\r\nasking no favours of capital on the one hand, nor of hired labourers or\r\nslaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable number of\r\npersons mingle their own labour with capital--that is, they labour with\r\ntheir own hands, and also buy or hire others to labour for them; but\r\nthis is only a mixed and not a distinct class. No principle stated is\r\ndisturbed by the existence of this mixed class.\r\n\r\nAgain, as has already been said, there is not of necessity any such\r\nthing as the free, hired labourer being fixed to that condition for\r\nlife. Many independent men, everywhere in these States, a few years back\r\nin their lives were hired labourers. The prudent, penniless beginner in\r\nthe world labours for wages a while, saves a surplus with which to buy\r\ntools or land for himself, then labours on his own account another\r\nwhile, and at length hires another new beginner to help him. This is the\r\njust and generous and prosperous system which opens the way to all,\r\ngives hope to all, and consequent energy and progress and improvement of\r\ncondition to all. No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those\r\nwho toil up from poverty, none less inclined to take or touch aught\r\nwhich they have not honestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a\r\npolitical power which they already possess, and which, if surrendered,\r\nwill surely be used to close the door of advancement against such as\r\nthey, and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon them, till all of\r\nliberty shall be lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter to General G.B. McClellan. Washington. February 3, 1862_\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir, You and I have distinct and different plans for a movement\r\nof the Army of the Potomac--yours to be down the Chesapeake, up the\r\nRappahannock to Urbana and across land to the terminus of the railroad\r\non the York River; mine to move directly to a point on the railroad\r\nsouthwest of Manassas.\r\n\r\nIf you will give me satisfactory answers to the following questions, I\r\nshall gladly yield my plan to yours.\r\n\r\n_First._ Does not your plan involve a greatly larger expenditure of time\r\nand money than mine?\r\n\r\n_Second._ Wherein is a victory more certain by your plan than mine?\r\n\r\n_Third._ Wherein is a victory more valuable by your plan than mine?\r\n\r\n_Fourth._ In fact, would it not be less valuable in this, that it would\r\nbreak no great line of the enemy\'s communications, while mine would?\r\n\r\n_Fifth._ In case of disaster, would not a retreat be more difficult by\r\nyour plan than mine?\r\n\r\nI have just assisted the Secretary of War in framing part of a despatch\r\nto you, relating to army corps, which despatch of course will have\r\nreached you long before this will.\r\n\r\nI wish to say a few words to you privately on this subject. I ordered\r\nthe army corps organization, not only on the unanimous opinion of the\r\ntwelve generals whom you had selected and assigned as generals of\r\ndivision, but also on the unanimous opinion of every _military man_ I\r\ncould get an opinion from (and every modern military book), yourself\r\nonly excepted. Of course I did not on my own judgment pretend to\r\nunderstand the subject. I now think it indispensable for you to know how\r\nyour struggle against it is received in quarters which we cannot\r\nentirely disregard. It is looked upon as merely an effort to pamper one\r\nor two pets and to persecute and degrade their supposed rivals. I have\r\nhad no word from Sumner, Heintzelman, or Keyes. The commanders of these\r\ncorps are of course the three highest officers with you, but I am\r\nconstantly told that you have no consultation or communication with\r\nthem,--that you consult and communicate with nobody but General Fitz\r\nJohn Porter, and perhaps General Franklin. I do not say these complaints\r\nare true or just, but at all events it is proper you should know of\r\ntheir existence. Do the commanders of corps disobey your orders in\r\nanything?\r\n\r\n... Are you strong enough--are you strong enough, even with my help--to\r\nset your foot upon the necks of Sumner, Heintzelman, and Keyes, all at\r\nonce? This is a practical and a very serious question for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lincoln\'s Proclamation revoking General Hunter\'s Order setting the\r\nSlaves free. May 19, 1862_\r\n\r\n\r\n... General Hunter nor any other commander or person has been authorized\r\nby the Government of the United States to make proclamation declaring\r\nthe slaves of any State free, and that the supposed proclamation now in\r\nquestion, whether genuine or false, is altogether void so far as\r\nrespects such declaration.... On the sixth day of March last, by a\r\nspecial Message, I recommended to Congress the adoption of a joint\r\nresolution, to be substantially as follows:--_Resolved, That the United\r\nStates ought to co-operate with any State which may adopt a gradual\r\nabolishment of slavery, giving to such State earnest expression to\r\ncompensate for its inconveniences, public and private, produced by such\r\nchange of system_.\r\n\r\nThe resolution in the language above quoted was adopted by large\r\nmajorities in both branches of Congress, and now stands an authentic,\r\ndefinite, and solemn proposal of the nation to the States and people\r\nmost immediately interested in the subject-matter. To the people of\r\nthose States I now earnestly appeal. I do not argue--I beseech you to\r\nmake arguments for yourselves. You cannot, if you would, be blind to the\r\nsigns of the times. I beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of\r\nthem, ranging, if it may be, far above personal and partisan politics.\r\nThe proposal makes common cause for a common object, casting no\r\nreproaches upon any. It acts not the Pharisee. The change it\r\ncontemplates would come gently as the dews of heaven, not rending or\r\nwrecking anything. Will you not embrace it? So much good has not been\r\ndone by one effort in all past time as in the providence of God it is\r\nnow your high privilege to do. May the vast future not have to lament\r\nthat you have neglected it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Appeal to the Border States in behalf of Compensated Emancipation.\r\nJuly 12, 1862_\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the adjournment of Congress, now near, I shall have no opportunity\r\nof seeing you for several months. Believing that you of the border\r\nStates hold more power for good than any other equal number of members,\r\nI feel it a duty which I cannot justifiably waive, to make this appeal\r\nto you.\r\n\r\nI do not speak of emancipation at once, but of a decision at once to\r\nemancipate gradually. Room in South America for colonization can be\r\nobtained cheaply and in abundance, and when numbers shall be large\r\nenough to be company and encouragement for one another, the freed people\r\nwill not be so reluctant to go.\r\n\r\nI am pressed with a difficulty not yet mentioned,--one which threatens\r\ndivision among those who, united, are none too strong. General Hunter is\r\nan honest man. He was, and I hope still is, my friend. I valued him none\r\nthe less for his agreeing with me in the general wish that all men\r\neverywhere could be free. He proclaimed all men free within certain\r\nStates, and I repudiated the proclamation. He expected more good and\r\nless harm from the measure than I could believe would follow. Yet in\r\nrepudiating it, I gave dissatisfaction if not offence to many whose\r\nsupport the country cannot afford to lose. And this is not the end of\r\nit. The pressure in this direction is still upon me, and is increasing.\r\nBy conceding what I now ask, you can relieve me, and, much more, can\r\nrelieve the country, in this important point.\r\n\r\nUpon these considerations I have again begged your attention to the\r\nmessage of March last. Before leaving the Capitol, consider and discuss\r\nit among yourselves. You are patriots and statesmen, and as such, I pray\r\nyou, consider this proposition, and at the least commend it to the\r\nconsideration of your States and people. As you would perpetuate popular\r\ngovernment for the best people in the world, I beseech you that you do\r\nin no wise omit this. Our common country is in great peril, demanding\r\nthe loftiest views and boldest action to bring it speedy relief. Once\r\nrelieved, its form of government is saved to the world, its beloved\r\nhistory and cherished memories are vindicated, and its happy future\r\nfully assured and rendered inconceivably grand.\r\n\r\nI intend no reproach or complaint when I assure you that, in my opinion,\r\nif you all had voted for the resolution in the gradual-emancipation\r\nmessage of last March, the war would now be substantially ended. And the\r\nplan therein proposed is yet one of the most potent and swift means of\r\nending it. Let the States which are in rebellion see, definitely and\r\ncertainly, that in no event will the States you represent ever join\r\ntheir proposed confederacy, and they cannot much longer maintain the\r\ncontest. But you cannot divest them of their hope to ultimately have you\r\nwith them, so long as you show a determination to perpetuate the\r\ninstitution within your own States. Beat them at elections, as you have\r\noverwhelmingly done, and, nothing daunted, they still claim you as their\r\nown. You and I know what the lever of their power is. Break that lever\r\nbefore their faces, and they can shake you no more for ever.\r\n\r\nMost of you have treated me with kindness and consideration, and I trust\r\nyou will not now think I improperly touch what is exclusively your own,\r\nwhen, for the sake of the whole country, I ask, Can you, for your\r\nStates, do better than to take the course I urge? Discarding punctilio\r\nand maxims adapted to more manageable times, and looking only to the\r\nunprecedentedly stern facts of our case, can you do better in any\r\npossible event? You prefer that the constitutional relation of the\r\nStates to the nation shall be practically restored without disturbance\r\nof the institution; and if this were done, my whole duty in this\r\nrespect, under the Constitution and my oath of office, would be\r\nperformed. But it is not done, and we are trying to accomplish it by\r\nwar. The incidents of the war cannot be avoided. If the war continues\r\nlong, as it must if the object be not sooner attained, the institution\r\nin your States will be extinguished by mere friction and abrasion,--by\r\nthe mere incidents of the war. It will be gone, and you will have\r\nnothing valuable in lieu of it. Much of its value is gone already. How\r\nmuch better for you and for your people to take the step which at once\r\nshortens the war and secures substantial compensation for that which is\r\nsure to be wholly lost in any other event? How much better to thus save\r\nthe money which else we sink for ever in the war! How much better to do\r\nit while we can, lest the war ere long render us pecuniarily unable to\r\ndo it! How much better for you as seller, and the nation as buyer, to\r\nsell out and buy out that without which the war could never have been,\r\nthan to sink both the thing to be sold and the price of it in cutting\r\none another\'s throats!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From a Letter to Cuthbert Bullitt. July 28, 1862_\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, I think the true remedy is very different from that suggested by\r\nMr. Durant. It does not lie in rounding the rough angles of the war, but\r\nin removing the necessity for the war. The people of Louisiana who wish\r\nprotection to person and property, have but to reach forth their hands\r\nand take it. Let them in good faith reinaugurate the national authority,\r\nand set up a State government conforming thereto under the Constitution.\r\nThey know how to do it, and can have the protection of the army while\r\ndoing it. The army will be withdrawn as soon as such government can\r\ndispense with its presence, and the people of the State can then, upon\r\nthe old constitutional terms, govern themselves to their own liking.\r\nThis is very simple and easy.\r\n\r\nIf they will not do this, if they prefer to hazard all for the sake of\r\ndestroying the government, it is for them to consider whether it is\r\nprobable that I will surrender the government to save them from losing\r\nall. If they decline what I suggest, you will scarcely need to ask what\r\nI will do.\r\n\r\nWhat would you do in my position? Would you drop the war where it is, or\r\nwould you prosecute it in future with elder-stalk squirts charged with\r\nrose-water? Would you deal lighter blows rather than heavier ones? Would\r\nyou give up the contest, leaving any available means untried?\r\n\r\nI am in no boastful mood. I shall not do more than I can; but I shall do\r\nall I can to save the government, which is my sworn duty as well as my\r\npersonal inclination. I shall do nothing in malice. What I deal with is\r\ntoo vast for malicious dealing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter to August Belmont. July 31, 1862_\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Sir, You send to Mr. W---- an extract from a letter written at New\r\nOrleans the 9th instant, which is shown to me. You do not give the\r\nwriter\'s name; but plainly he is a man of ability, and probably of some\r\nnote. He says: "The time has arrived when Mr. Lincoln must take a\r\ndecisive course. Trying to please everybody, he will satisfy nobody. A\r\nvacillating policy in matters of importance is the very worst. Now is\r\nthe time, if ever, for honest men who love their country to rally to its\r\nsupport. Why will not the North say officially that it wishes for the\r\nrestoration of the Union as it was?"\r\n\r\nAnd so, it seems, this is the point on which the writer thinks I have no\r\npolicy. Why will he not read and understand what I have said?\r\n\r\nThe substance of the very declaration he desires is in the inaugural, in\r\neach of the two regular messages to Congress, and in many, if not all,\r\nthe minor documents issued by the Executive since the Inauguration.\r\n\r\nBroken eggs cannot be mended; but Louisiana has nothing to do now but to\r\ntake her place in the Union as it was, barring the already broken eggs.\r\nThe sooner she does so, the smaller will be the amount of that which\r\nwill be past mending. This government cannot much longer play a game in\r\nwhich it stakes all, and its enemies stake nothing. Those enemies must\r\nunderstand that they cannot experiment for ten years trying to destroy\r\nthe government, and if they fail still come back into the Union unhurt.\r\nIf they expect in any contingency to ever have the Union as it was, I\r\njoin with the writer in saying, "Now is the time."\r\n\r\nHow much better it would have been for the writer to have gone at this,\r\nunder the protection of the army at New Orleans, than to have sat down\r\nin a closet writing complaining letters northward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_His Letter to Horace Greeley. August 22, 1862_\r\n\r\n\r\nI have just read yours of the 19th instant, addressed to myself through\r\nthe "New York Tribune."\r\n\r\nIf there be in it any statements or assumptions of fact which I may know\r\nto be erroneous, I do not now and here controvert them.\r\n\r\nIf there be in it any inferences which I may believe to be falsely\r\ndrawn, I do not now and here argue against them.\r\n\r\nIf there be perceptible in it an impatient and dictatorial tone, I waive\r\nit, in deference to an old friend whose heart I have always supposed to\r\nbe right.\r\n\r\nAs to the policy I "seem to be pursuing," as you say, I have not meant\r\nto leave any one in doubt. I would save the Union. I would save it in\r\nthe shortest way under the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe sooner the national authority can be restored, the nearer the Union\r\nwill be,--the Union as it was.\r\n\r\nIf there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the\r\nsame time save slavery, I do not agree with them.\r\n\r\nIf there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the\r\nsame time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them.\r\n\r\n_My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and not\r\neither to save or to destroy slavery._\r\n\r\nIf I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; if I\r\ncould save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could\r\nsave it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that.\r\n\r\nWhat I do about slavery and the coloured race, I do because I believe it\r\nhelps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not\r\nbelieve it would help to save the Union.\r\n\r\nI shall do less whenever I shall believe that what I am doing hurts the\r\ncause; and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help\r\nthe cause.\r\n\r\nI shall try to correct errors where shown to be errors, and I shall\r\nadopt new views as fast as they shall appear to be true views.\r\n\r\nI have here stated my purpose according to my views of official duty,\r\nand I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all\r\nmen everywhere could be free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From his Reply to the Chicago Committee of United Religious\r\nDenominations. September 13, 1862_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject presented in the memorial is one upon which I have thought\r\nmuch for weeks past, and I may even say for months. I am approached with\r\nthe most opposite opinions and advice, and that by religious men, who\r\nare equally certain that they represent the Divine will. I am sure that\r\neither the one or the other class is mistaken in that belief, and\r\nperhaps, in some respects, both. I hope it will not be irreverent for me\r\nto say, that if it is probable that God would reveal His will to others,\r\non a point so connected with my duty, it might be supposed that He would\r\nreveal it directly to me; for, unless I am more deceived in myself than\r\nI often am, it is my earnest desire to know the will of Providence in\r\nthis matter. And if I can learn what it is, I will do it. These are not,\r\nhowever, the days of miracles, and I suppose it will be granted that I\r\nam not to expect a direct revelation. I must study the plain, physical\r\nfacts of the case, ascertain what is possible, and learn what appears\r\nto be wise and right.\r\n\r\nThe subject is difficult, and good men do not agree. For instance, four\r\ngentlemen of standing and intelligence, from New York, called as a\r\ndelegation on business connected with the war; but before leaving, two\r\nof them earnestly besought me to proclaim general emancipation, upon\r\nwhich the other two at once attacked them. You also know that the last\r\nsession of Congress had a decided majority of anti-slavery men, yet they\r\ncould not unite on this policy. And the same is true of the religious\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWhy the rebel soldiers are praying with a great deal more earnestness, I\r\nfear, than our own troops, and expecting God to favour their side: for\r\none of our soldiers who had been taken prisoner told Senator Wilson a\r\nfew days since that he met nothing so discouraging as the evident\r\nsincerity of those he was among in their prayers. But we will talk over\r\nthe merits of the case.\r\n\r\nWhat good would a proclamation of emancipation from me do, especially as\r\nwe are now situated? I do not want to issue a document that the whole\r\nworld will see must necessarily be inoperative, like the Pope\'s bull\r\nagainst the comet! Would my word free the slaves, when I cannot even\r\nenforce the Constitution in the rebel States? Is there a single court or\r\nmagistrate or individual that would be influenced by it there?\r\n\r\nAnd what reason is there to think it would have any greater effect upon\r\nthe slaves than the late law of Congress, which I approved, and which\r\noffers protection and freedom to the slaves of rebel masters who come\r\nwithin our lines? Yet I cannot learn that that law has caused a single\r\nslave to come over to us. And suppose they could be induced by a\r\nproclamation of freedom from me to throw themselves upon us, what should\r\nwe do with them? How can we feed and care for such a multitude? General\r\nButler wrote me a few days since that he was issuing more rations to the\r\nslaves who have rushed to him than to all the white troops under his\r\ncommand. They eat, and that is all; though it is true General Butler is\r\nfeeding the whites also by the thousand, for it nearly amounts to a\r\nfamine there. If now, the pressure of the war should call off our forces\r\nfrom New Orleans to defend some other point, what is to prevent the\r\nmasters from reducing the blacks to slavery again? For I am told that\r\nwhenever the rebels take any black prisoners, free or slave, they\r\nimmediately auction them off! They did so with those they took from a\r\nboat that was aground in the Tennessee River a few days ago. And then I\r\nam very ungenerously attacked for it. For instance, when, after the late\r\nbattles at and near Bull Run, an expedition went out from Washington\r\nunder a flag of truce to bury the dead and bring in the wounded, and the\r\nrebels seized the blacks who went along to help, and sent them into\r\nslavery, Horace Greeley said in his paper "that the government would\r\nprobably do nothing about it." What could I do?\r\n\r\nNow, then, tell me, if you please, what possible result of good would\r\nfollow the issuing of such a proclamation as you desire? Understand, I\r\nraise no objections against it on legal or constitutional grounds, for,\r\nas commander-in-chief of the army and navy, in time of war I suppose I\r\nhave a right to take any measures which may best subdue the enemy; nor\r\ndo I urge objections of a moral nature, in view of possible consequences\r\nof insurrection and massacre at the South. I view this matter as a\r\npractical war-measure, to be decided on according to the advantages or\r\ndisadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the rebellion.\r\n\r\n[The committee had said that emancipation would secure us the sympathy\r\nof the world, slavery being the cause of the war. To which the President\r\nreplied:]\r\n\r\nI admit that slavery is at the root of the rebellion, or at least its\r\n_sine qua non_. The ambition of politicians may have instigated them to\r\nact, but they would have been impotent without slavery as their\r\ninstrument. I will also concede that emancipation would help us in\r\nEurope, and convince them that we are incited by something more than\r\nambition. I grant further, that it would help somewhat at the North,\r\nthough not so much, I fear, as you and those you represent, imagine.\r\nStill, some additional strength would be added in that way to the\r\nwar,--and then, unquestionably, it would weaken the rebels by drawing\r\noff their labourers, which is of great importance; but I am not so sure\r\nthat we could do much with the blacks. If we were to arm them, I fear\r\nthat in a few weeks the arms would be in the hands of the rebels; and\r\nindeed, thus far, we have not had arms enough to equip our white troops.\r\nI will mention another thing, though it meet only your scorn and\r\ncontempt. There are fifty thousand bayonets in the Union armies from the\r\nborder slave States. It would be a serious matter if, in consequence of\r\na proclamation such as you desire, they should go over to the rebels. I\r\ndo not think they all would,--not so many indeed, as a year ago, nor as\r\nsix months ago; not so many to-day as yesterday. Every day increases\r\ntheir Union feeling. They are also getting their pride enlisted, and\r\nwant to beat the rebels. Let me say one thing more: I think you should\r\nadmit that we already have an important principle to rally and unite the\r\npeople, in the fact that constitutional government is at stake. This is\r\na fundamental idea, going down about as deep as anything.\r\n\r\nDo not misunderstand me because I have mentioned these objections. They\r\nindicate the difficulties that have thus far prevented my action in some\r\nsuch way as you desire. I have not decided against a proclamation of\r\nliberty to the slaves, but hold the matter under advisement. And I can\r\nassure you that the subject is on my mind by day and night, more than\r\nany other. Whatever shall appear to be God\'s will, I will do. I trust\r\nthat in the freedom with which I have canvassed your views, I have not\r\nin any respect injured your feelings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the Annual Message to Congress. December 1, 1862_\r\n\r\n\r\nSince your last annual assembling, another year of health and bountiful\r\nharvests has passed; and while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless\r\nus with a return of peace, we can but press on, guided by the best light\r\nHe gives us, trusting that in His own good time and wise way, all will\r\nyet be well.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence, touching foreign affairs, which has taken place\r\nduring the last year, is herewith submitted, in virtual compliance with\r\na request to that effect made by the House of Representatives near the\r\nclose of the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\nIf the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying\r\nthan it has usually been at former periods, it is certainly more\r\nsatisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we are, might\r\nreasonably have apprehended. In the month of June last, there were some\r\ngrounds to expect that the maritime powers, which, at the beginning of\r\nour domestic difficulties, so unwisely and unnecessarily, as we think,\r\nrecognized the insurgents as a belligerent, would soon recede from that\r\nposition, which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to our\r\nown country. But the temporary reverses which afterward befell the\r\nnational arms, and which were exaggerated by our own disloyal citizens\r\nabroad, have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War, which has so radically changed for the moment the\r\noccupations and habits of the American people, has necessarily disturbed\r\nthe social condition and affected very deeply the prosperity of the\r\nnations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily\r\nincreasing throughout a period of half a century. It has, at the same\r\ntime, excited political ambitions and apprehensions which have produced\r\na profound agitation throughout the civilized world. In this unusual\r\nagitation we have forborne from taking part in any controversy between\r\nforeign States, and between parties or factions in such States. We have\r\nattempted no propagandism and acknowledged no revolution. But we have\r\nleft to every nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own\r\naffairs. Our struggle has been, of course, contemplated by foreign\r\nnations with reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and\r\noften exaggerated effects and consequences resulting to those nations\r\nthemselves. Nevertheless, complaint on the part of this government, even\r\nif it were just, would certainly be unwise....\r\n\r\nThere is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary,\r\nupon which to divide. Trace through from east to west upon the line\r\nbetween the free and the slave country, and we shall find a little more\r\nthan one-third of its length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and\r\npopulated, or soon to be populated, thickly upon both sides; while\r\nnearly all its remaining length are merely surveyors\' lines, over which\r\npeople may walk back and forth without any consciousness of their\r\npresence. No part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass,\r\nby writing it down on paper or parchment as a national boundary. The\r\nfact of separation, if it comes, gives up, on the part of the seceding\r\nsection, the fugitive-slave clause, along with all other constitutional\r\nobligations upon the section seceded from, while I should expect no\r\ntreaty stipulation would be ever made to take its place.\r\n\r\nBut there is another difficulty. The great interior region bounded east\r\nby the Alleghanies, north by the British dominions, west by the Rocky\r\nMountains, and south by the line along which the culture of corn and\r\ncotton meets, ... already has above ten millions of people, and will\r\nhave fifty millions within fifty years, if not prevented by any\r\npolitical folly or mistake. It contains more than one-third of the\r\ncountry owned by the United States,--certainly more than one million of\r\nsquare miles. Once half as populous as Massachusetts already is, and it\r\nwould have more than seventy-five millions of people. A glance at the\r\nmap shows that, territorially speaking, it is the great body of the\r\nrepublic. The other parts are but marginal borders to it, the\r\nmagnificent region sloping west from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific\r\nbeing the deepest, and also the richest, in undeveloped resources. In\r\nthe production of provisions, grains, grasses, and all which proceed\r\nfrom them, this great interior region is naturally one of the most\r\nimportant in the world. Ascertain from the statistics the small\r\nproportion of the region which has, as yet, been brought into\r\ncultivation, and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its\r\nproducts, and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect\r\npresented. And yet this region has no sea-coast, touches no ocean\r\nanywhere. As part of one nation, its people now find, and may for ever\r\nfind, their way to Europe by New York, to South America and Africa by\r\nNew Orleans, and to Asia by San Francisco. But separate our common\r\ncountry into two nations, as designed by the present rebellion, and\r\nevery man of this great interior region is thereby cut off from one or\r\nmore of these outlets,--not perhaps by a physical barrier, but by\r\nembarrassing and onerous trade regulations.\r\n\r\nAnd this is true, wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed.\r\nPlace it between the now free and slave country, or place it south of\r\nKentucky, or north of Ohio, and still the truth remains that none south\r\nof it can trade to any port or place north of it, except upon terms\r\ndictated by a government foreign to them. These outlets, east, west, and\r\nsouth, are indispensable to the well-being of the people inhabiting, and\r\nto inhabit, this vast interior region. Which of the three may be the\r\nbest, is no proper question. All are better than either; and all of\r\nright belong to that people and their successors for ever. True to\r\nthemselves, they will not ask where a line of separation shall be, but\r\nwill vow rather that there shall be no such line. Nor are the marginal\r\nregions less interested in these communications to and through them to\r\nthe great outside world. They too, and each of them, must have access to\r\nthis Egypt of the west, without paying toll at the crossing of any\r\nnational boundary.\r\n\r\nOur national strife springs not from our permanent part, not from the\r\nland we inhabit, not from our national homestead. There is no possible\r\nsevering of this but would multiply and not mitigate evils among us. In\r\nall its adaptations and aptitudes, it demands union and abhors\r\nseparation. In fact, it would ere long force reunion, however much of\r\nblood and treasure the separation might have cost....\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this\r\nAdministration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal\r\nsignificance or insignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery\r\ntrial through which we pass will light us down, in honour or dishonour,\r\nto the latest generation. We say we are for the Union. The world will\r\nnot forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union. The world\r\nknows we do know how to save it.\r\n\r\nWe, even we here, hold the power and bear the responsibility. In giving\r\nfreedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free,--honourable alike\r\nin what we give and what we preserve. We shall nobly save or meanly lose\r\nthe last, best hope of earth. Other means may succeed; this could not\r\nfail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just,--a way which, if\r\nfollowed, the world will for ever applaud, and God must for ever bless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Emancipation Proclamation. January 1, 1863_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas, on the twenty-second day of September, in the year of our Lord\r\none thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, a proclamation was issued by\r\nthe President of the United States, containing, among other things, the\r\nfollowing, to wit:\r\n\r\n"That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand\r\neight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any\r\nState, or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be\r\nin rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward,\r\nand for ever free; and the Executive Government of the United States,\r\nincluding the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and\r\nmaintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to\r\nrepress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for\r\ntheir actual freedom.\r\n\r\n"That the Executive will, on the first day of January aforesaid, by\r\nproclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in which\r\nthe people thereof respectively shall then be in rebellion against the\r\nUnited States; and the fact that any State, or the people thereof, shall\r\non that day be in good faith represented in the Congress of the United\r\nStates by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the\r\nqualified voters of such State shall have participated, shall in the\r\nabsence of strong countervailing testimony be deemed conclusive evidence\r\nthat such State and the people thereof are not then in rebellion against\r\nthe United States."\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, by\r\nvirtue of the power in me vested as commander-in-chief of the army and\r\nnavy of the United States, in time of actual armed rebellion against the\r\nauthority and government of the United States, and as a fit and\r\nnecessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion, do, on this first\r\nday of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and\r\nsixty-three, and in accordance with my purpose so to do, publicly\r\nproclaimed for the full period of one hundred days from the day first\r\nabove mentioned, order and designate as the States and parts of States\r\nwherein the people thereof, respectively, are this day in rebellion\r\nagainst the United States, the following, to wit:\r\n\r\nArkansas, Texas, Louisiana (except the parishes of St. Bernard,\r\nPlaquemines, Jefferson, St. John, St. Charles, St. James, Ascension,\r\nAssumption, Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Mary, St. Martin, and Orleans,\r\nincluding the city of New Orleans), Mississippi, Alabama, Florida,\r\nGeorgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia (except the\r\nforty-eight counties designated as West Virginia, and also the counties\r\nof Berkeley, Accomac, Northampton, Elizabeth City, York, Princess Anne,\r\nand Norfolk, including the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth), and which\r\nexcepted parts are for the present left precisely as if this\r\nproclamation were not issued.\r\n\r\nAnd by virtue of the power and for the purpose aforesaid, I do order and\r\ndeclare that all persons held as slaves within said designated States\r\nand parts of States are, and henceforward shall be, free; and that the\r\nExecutive Government of the United States, including the military and\r\nnaval authorities thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of\r\nsaid persons.\r\n\r\nAnd I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to abstain\r\nfrom all violence, unless in necessary self-defence; and I recommend to\r\nthem that, in all cases when allowed, they labour faithfully for\r\nreasonable wages.\r\n\r\nAnd I further declare and make known that such persons of suitable\r\ncondition will be received into the armed service of the United States\r\nto garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man\r\nvessels of all sorts in said service.\r\n\r\nAnd upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice, warranted\r\nby the Constitution upon military necessity, I invoke the considerate\r\njudgment of mankind and the gracious favour of Almighty God.\r\n\r\nIn witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: L.S.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington, this first day of January, in the year\r\nof our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States of America the eighty-seventh.\r\n\r\n     ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n     By the President:\r\n       WILLIAM H.

I\r\nwrite this now as a grateful acknowledgment for the almost inestimable\r\nservice you have done the country. I wish to say a word further. When\r\nyou first reached the vicinity of Vicksburg, I thought you should do\r\nwhat you finally did--march the troops across the neck, run the\r\nbatteries with the transports, and thus go below; and I never had any\r\nfaith, except a general hope that you knew better than I, that the Yazoo\r\nPass expedition and the like could succeed. When you got below and took\r\nPort Gibson, Grand Gulf, and vicinity, I thought you should go down the\r\nriver and join General Banks, and when you turned northward, east of the\r\nBig Black, I feared it was a mistake. I now wish to make the personal\r\nacknowledgment that you were right and I was wrong.\r\n\r\n     Yours very truly,\r\n       A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter to ---- Moulton. Washington. July 31, 1863_\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir, There has been a good deal of complaint against you by your\r\nsuperior officers of the Provost-Marshal-General\'s Department, and your\r\nremoval has been strongly urged on the ground of "persistent\r\ndisobedience of orders and neglect of duty." Firmly convinced, as I am,\r\nof the patriotism of your motives, I am unwilling to do anything in your\r\ncase which may seem unnecessarily harsh or at variance with the feelings\r\nof personal respect and esteem with which I have always regarded you. I\r\nconsider your services in your district valuable, and should be sorry to\r\nlose them. It is unnecessary for me to state, however, that when\r\ndifferences of opinion arise between officers of the government, the\r\nranking officer must be obeyed. You of course recognize as clearly as I\r\ndo the importance of this rule. I hope you will conclude to go on in\r\nyour present position under the regulations of the department. I wish\r\nyou would write to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter to Mrs. Lincoln. Washington. August 8, 1863_\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Wife, All as well as usual, and no particular trouble anyway. I\r\nput the money into the Treasury at five per cent., with the privilege of\r\nwithdrawing it any time upon thirty days\' notice. I suppose you are glad\r\nto learn this. Tell dear Tad poor "Nanny Goat" is lost, and Mrs.\r\nCuthbert and I are in distress about it. The day you left Nanny was\r\nfound resting herself and chewing her little cud on the middle of Tad\'s\r\nbed; but now she\'s gone! The gardener kept complaining that she\r\ndestroyed the flowers, till it was concluded to bring her down to the\r\nWhite House. This was done, and the second day she had disappeared and\r\nhas not been heard of since. This is the last we know of poor "Nanny."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter to James H. Hackett. Washington. August 17, 1863_\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir, Months ago I should have acknowledged the receipt of your\r\nbook and accompanying kind note; and I now have to beg your pardon for\r\nnot having done so.\r\n\r\nFor one of my age I have seen very little of the drama. The first\r\npresentation of Falstaff I ever saw was yours here, last winter or\r\nspring. Perhaps the best compliment I can pay is to say, as I truly can,\r\nI am very anxious to see it again. Some of Shakespeare\'s plays I have\r\nnever read; while others I have gone over perhaps as frequently as any\r\nunprofessional reader. Among the latter are _Lear_, _Richard III._,\r\n_Henry VIII._, _Hamlet_, and especially _Macbeth_. I think nothing\r\nequals _Macbeth_. It is wonderful.\r\n\r\nUnlike you gentlemen of the profession, I think the soliloquy in\r\n_Hamlet_ commencing "Oh, my offence is rank," surpasses that commencing\r\n"To be or not to be." But pardon this small attempt at criticism. I\r\nshould like to hear you pronounce the opening speech of Richard III.\r\nWill you not soon visit Washington again? If you do, please call and let\r\nme make your personal acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note to Secretary Stanton. Washington. November 11, 1863_\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Sir, I personally wish Jacob Freese, of New Jersey, to be appointed\r\nColonel of a coloured regiment, and this regardless of whether he can\r\ntell the exact shade of Julius C\xc3\xa6sar\'s hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Letter to James C. Conkling. August 26, 1863_\r\n\r\n\r\nYour letter inviting me to attend a mass meeting of unconditional Union\r\nmen, to be held at the capital of Illinois on the third day of\r\nSeptember, has been received. It would be very agreeable to me to thus\r\nmeet my old friends at my own home, but I cannot just now be absent from\r\nhere so long as a visit there would require.\r\n\r\nThe meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional devotion to\r\nthe Union; and I am sure my old political friends will thank me for\r\ntendering, as I do, the nation\'s gratitude to those and other noble men\r\nwhom no partisan malice or partisan hope can make false to the nation\'s\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThere are those who are dissatisfied with me. To such I would say: You\r\ndesire peace, and you blame me that we do not have it. But how can we\r\nattain it? There are but three conceivable ways. First, to suppress the\r\nrebellion by force of arms. This I am trying to do. Are you for it? If\r\nyou are, so far we are agreed. If you are not for it, a second way is to\r\ngive up the Union. I am against this. Are you for it? If you are, you\r\nshould say so plainly. If you are not for force, nor yet for\r\ndissolution, there only remains some imaginable compromise. I do not\r\nbelieve any compromise embracing the maintenance of the Union is now\r\npossible. All I learn leads to a directly opposite belief. The strength\r\nof the rebellion is its military, its army. That army dominates all the\r\ncountry and all the people within its range. Any offer of terms made by\r\nany man or men within that range, in opposition to that army, is simply\r\nnothing for the present, because such man or men have no power whatever\r\nto enforce their side of a compromise, if one were made with them.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: Suppose refugees from the South and peace men of the\r\nNorth get together in convention, and frame and proclaim a compromise\r\nembracing a restoration of the Union. In what way can that compromise be\r\nused to keep Lee\'s army out of Pennsylvania? Meade\'s army can keep Lee\'s\r\nout of Pennsylvania, and, I think, can ultimately drive it out of\r\nexistence. But no paper compromise, to which the controllers of Lee\'s\r\narmy are not agreed, can at all affect that army. In an effort at such\r\ncompromise we should waste time which the enemy would improve to our\r\ndisadvantage; and that would be all. A compromise, to be effective, must\r\nbe made either with those who control the rebel army, or with the people\r\nfirst liberated from the domination of that army by the success of our\r\nown army. Now, allow me to assure you that no word or intimation from\r\nthat rebel army, or from any of the men controlling it, in relation to\r\nany peace compromise, has ever come to my knowledge or belief. All\r\ncharges and insinuations to the contrary are deceptive and groundless.\r\nAnd I promise you that if any such proposition shall hereafter come, it\r\nshall not be rejected and kept a secret from you. I freely acknowledge\r\nmyself the servant of the people, according to the bond of service,--the\r\nUnited States Constitution,--and that, as such, I am responsible to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut to be plain. You are dissatisfied with me about the negro. Quite\r\nlikely there is a difference of opinion between you and myself upon that\r\nsubject. I certainly wish that all men could be free, while I suppose\r\nyou do not. Yet I have neither adopted nor proposed any measure which is\r\nnot consistent with even your views, provided you are for the Union. I\r\nsuggested compensated emancipation, to which you replied, you wished\r\nnot to be taxed to buy negroes. But I had not asked you to be taxed to\r\nbuy negroes, except in such way as to save you from greater taxation to\r\nsave the Union exclusively by other means.\r\n\r\nYou dislike the Emancipation Proclamation, and perhaps would have it\r\nretracted. You say it is unconstitutional. I think differently. I think\r\nthe Constitution invests its commander-in-chief with the law of war in\r\ntime of war. The most that can be said--if so much--is that slaves are\r\nproperty. Is there, has there ever been, any question that, by the law\r\nof war, property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed?\r\nAnd is it not needed whenever taking it helps us or hurts the enemy?\r\nArmies the world over destroy enemies\' property when they cannot use it,\r\nand even destroy their own to keep it from the enemy. Civilized\r\nbelligerents do all in their power to help themselves or hurt the enemy,\r\nexcept a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel. Among the exceptions\r\nare the massacre of vanquished foes and non-combatants, male and female.\r\n\r\nBut the proclamation, as law, either is valid or is not valid. If it is\r\nnot valid, it needs no retraction. If it is valid, it cannot be\r\nretracted any more than the dead can be brought to life. Some of you\r\nprofess to think its retraction would operate favourably for the Union.\r\nWhy better after the retraction than before the issue? There was more\r\nthan a year and a half of trial to suppress the rebellion before the\r\nproclamation issued, the last one hundred days of which passed under an\r\nexplicit notice that it was coming, unless averted by those in revolt\r\nreturning to their allegiance. The war has certainly progressed as\r\nfavourably for us since the issue of the proclamation as before. I know,\r\nas fully as one can know the opinions of others, that some of the\r\ncommanders of our armies in the field who have given us our most\r\nimportant successes, believe the emancipation policy and the use of\r\ncoloured troops constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion,\r\nand that at least one of these important successes could not have been\r\nachieved when it was but for the aid of black soldiers. Among the\r\ncommanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity\r\nwith what is called Abolitionism or with Republican party politics, but\r\nwho hold them purely as military opinions. I submit these opinions as\r\nbeing entitled to some weight against the objections often urged, that\r\nemancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures, and\r\nwere not adopted as such in good faith.\r\n\r\nYou say you will not fight to free negroes. Some of them seem willing to\r\nfight for you; but no matter. Fight you, then, exclusively to save the\r\nUnion. I issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the\r\nUnion. Whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the Union, if\r\nI shall urge you to continue fighting, it will be an apt time then for\r\nyou to declare you will not fight to free negroes.\r\n\r\nI thought that in your struggle for the Union, to whatever extent the\r\nnegroes should cease helping the enemy, to that extent it weakened the\r\nenemy in his resistance to you. Do you think differently? I thought that\r\nwhatever negroes could be got to do as soldiers leaves just so much less\r\nfor white soldiers to do in saving the Union. Does it appear otherwise\r\nto you? But negroes, like other people, act upon motives. Why should\r\nthey do anything for us, if we will do nothing for them? If they stake\r\ntheir lives for us, they must be prompted by the strongest motive, even\r\nthe promise of freedom. And the promise being made, must be kept.\r\n\r\nThe signs look better. The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the\r\nsea. Thanks to the great Northwest for it. Nor yet wholly to them. Three\r\nhundred miles up they met New England, Empire, Keystone, and Jersey\r\nhewing their way right and left. The sunny South, too, in more colours\r\nthan one, also lent a hand. On the spot, their part of the history was\r\njotted down in black and white. The job was a great national one, and\r\nlet none be banned who bore an honourable part in it. And while those\r\nwho cleared the great river may well be proud, even that is not all. It\r\nis hard to say that anything has been more bravely and well done than at\r\nAntietam, Murfreesboro, Gettysburg, and on many fields of lesser note.\r\nNor must Uncle Sam\'s web-feet be forgotten. At all the watery margins\r\nthey have been present. Not only on the deep sea, the broad bay, and the\r\nrapid river, but also up the narrow, muddy bayou, and wherever the\r\nground was a little damp, they have been and made their tracks. Thanks\r\nto all,--for the great Republic, for the principle it lives by and keeps\r\nalive, for man\'s vast future,--thanks to all.\r\n\r\nPeace does not appear so distant as it did. I hope it will come soon,\r\nand come to stay; and so come as to be worth the keeping in all future\r\ntime. It will then have been proved that among freemen there can be no\r\nsuccessful appeal from the ballot to the bullet, and that they who take\r\nsuch appeal are sure to lose their case and pay the cost. And then there\r\nwill be some black men who can remember that with silent tongue, and\r\nclenched teeth, and steady eye, and well-poised bayonet, they have\r\nhelped mankind on to this great consummation, while I fear there will be\r\nsome white ones unable to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful\r\nspeech they strove to hinder it.\r\n\r\nStill, let us not be over-sanguine of a speedy, final triumph. Let us be\r\nquite sober. Let us diligently apply the means, never doubting that a\r\njust God, in His own good time, will give us the rightful result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_His Proclamation for a Day of Thanksgiving. October 3, 1863_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the\r\nblessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties,\r\nwhich are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source\r\nfrom which they come, others have been added, which are of so\r\nextraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften the\r\nheart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of\r\nAlmighty God.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity, which\r\nhas sometimes seemed to foreign States to invite and provoke their\r\naggressions, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been\r\nmaintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has\r\nprevailed everywhere, except in the theatre of military conflict; while\r\nthat theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and\r\nnavies of the Union.\r\n\r\nNeedful diversions of wealth and strength from the fields of peaceful\r\nindustry to the national defence have not arrested the plough, the\r\nshuttle, or the ship; the axe has enlarged the borders of our\r\nsettlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious\r\nmetals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population\r\nhas steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in\r\nthe camp, the siege, and the battle-field; and the country, rejoicing in\r\nthe consciousness of augmented strength and vigour, is permitted to\r\nexpect continuance of years with large increase of freedom.\r\n\r\nNo human counsel hath devised, nor hath any mortal hand worked out these\r\ngreat things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who,\r\nwhile dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless\r\nremembered mercy.\r\n\r\nIt has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly,\r\nreverently, and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice\r\nby the whole American people. I do, therefore, invite, my\r\nfellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who\r\nare at sea, and those sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and\r\nobserve the last Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving and\r\npraise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens. And I\r\nrecommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to\r\nHim for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with\r\nhumble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend\r\nto His tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners,\r\nor sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably\r\nengaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty Hand to\r\nheal the wounds of the nation, and to restore it, as soon as may be\r\nconsistent with the Divine purposes, to the full enjoyment of peace,\r\nharmony, tranquillity, and union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Address at the Dedication of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg.\r\nNovember 19, 1863_\r\n\r\n\r\nFourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this\r\ncontinent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the\r\nproposition that all men are created equal.\r\n\r\nNow we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or\r\nany nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on\r\na great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of\r\nthat field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives\r\nthat that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we\r\nshould do this.\r\n\r\nBut in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we\r\ncannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled\r\nhere, have consecrated it far above our power to add or detract. The\r\nworld will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can\r\nnever forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather, to be\r\ndedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have\r\nthus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to\r\nthe great task remaining before us; that from these honoured dead we\r\ntake increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full\r\nmeasure of devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall\r\nnot have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall have a new\r\nbirth of freedom; and that government of the people, by the people, and\r\nfor the people, shall not perish from the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the Annual Message to Congress. December 8, 1863_\r\n\r\n\r\n... When Congress assembled a year ago, the war had already lasted\r\nnearly twenty months, and there had been many conflicts on both land and\r\nsea, with varying results. The rebellion had been pressed back into\r\nreduced limits; yet the tone of public feeling and opinion at home and\r\nabroad was not satisfactory. With other signs, the popular elections\r\nthen just past indicated uneasiness among ourselves; while, amid much\r\nthat was cold and menacing, the kindest words coming from Europe were\r\nuttered in accents of pity that we were too blind to surrender a\r\nhopeless cause. Our commerce was suffering greatly from a few vessels\r\nbuilt upon and furnished from foreign shores, and we were threatened\r\nwith such additions from the same quarter as would sweep our trade from\r\nthe seas and raise our blockade. We had failed to elicit from European\r\ngovernments anything hopeful upon this subject. The preliminary\r\nEmancipation Proclamation, issued in September, was running its assigned\r\nperiod to the beginning of the new year. A month later the final\r\nproclamation came, including the announcement that coloured men of\r\nsuitable condition would be received into the war service. The policy of\r\nemancipation and of employing black soldiers gave to the future a new\r\naspect, about which hope and fear and doubt contended in uncertain\r\nconflict. According to our political system, as a matter of civil\r\nadministration, the general government had no lawful power to effect\r\nemancipation in any State, and for a long time it had been hoped that\r\nthe rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military\r\nmeasure. It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it\r\nmight come and that, if it should, the crisis of the contest would then\r\nbe presented. It came, and, as was anticipated, was followed by dark and\r\ndoubtful days. Eleven months having now passed, we are permitted to take\r\nanother review. The rebel borders are pressed still farther back, and by\r\nthe complete opening of the Mississippi, the country dominated by the\r\nrebellion is divided into distinct parts, with no practical\r\ncommunication between them. Tennessee and Arkansas have been\r\nsubstantially cleared of insurgent control, and influential citizens in\r\neach, owners of slaves and advocates of slavery at the beginning of the\r\nrebellion, now declare openly for emancipation in their respective\r\nStates. Of those States not included in the Emancipation Proclamation,\r\nMaryland and Missouri, neither of which three years ago would tolerate\r\nany restraint upon the extension of slavery into new Territories, only\r\ndispute now as to the best mode of removing it within their own limits.\r\n\r\nOf those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion, full one\r\nhundred thousand are now in the United States military service, about\r\none-half of which number actually bear arms in the ranks; thus giving\r\nthe double advantage of taking so much labour from the insurgent cause\r\nand supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many\r\nwhite men. So far as tested, it is difficult to say they are not as good\r\nsoldiers as any. No servile insurrection or tendency to violence or\r\ncruelty has marked the measures of emancipation and arming the blacks.\r\nThese measures have been much discussed in foreign countries, and\r\ncontemporary with such discussion the tone of public sentiment there is\r\nmuch improved. At home the same measures have been fully discussed,\r\nsupported, criticized, and denounced, and the annual elections following\r\nare highly encouraging to those whose official duty it is to bear the\r\ncountry through this great trial. Thus we have the new reckoning. The\r\ncrisis which threatened to divide the friends of the Union is passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter to Secretary Stanton. Washington. March 1, 1864_\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir, A poor widow, by the name of Baird, has a son in the army,\r\nthat for some offence has been sentenced to serve a long time without\r\npay, or at most with very little pay. I do not like this punishment of\r\nwithholding pay--it falls so very hard upon poor families. After he had\r\nbeen serving in this way for several months, at the tearful appeal of\r\nthe poor mother, I made a direction that he be allowed to enlist for a\r\nnew term, on the same condition as others. She now comes, and says she\r\ncannot get it acted upon. Please do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter to Governor Michael Hahn. Washington. March 13, 1864_\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Sir, I congratulate you on having fixed your name in history as\r\nthe first free-State governor of Louisiana. Now you are about to have a\r\nconvention, which, among other things, will probably define the elective\r\nfranchise. I barely suggest for your private consideration, whether some\r\nof the coloured people may not be let in--as, for instance, the very\r\nintelligent, and especially those who have fought gallantly in our\r\nranks. They would probably help, in some trying time to come, to keep\r\nthe jewel of liberty within the family of freedom. But this is only a\r\nsuggestion, not to the public, but to you alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Address at a Fair for the Sanitary Commission. March 18, 1864_\r\n\r\n\r\nI appear to say but a word. This extraordinary war in which we are\r\nengaged falls heavily upon all classes of people, but the most heavily\r\nupon the soldier. For it has been said, "all that a man hath will he\r\ngive for his life;" and while all contribute of their substance, the\r\nsoldier puts his life at stake, and often yields it up in his country\'s\r\ncause. _The highest merit, then, is due to the soldier._\r\n\r\nIn this extraordinary war extraordinary developments have manifested\r\nthemselves, such as have not been seen in former wars; and amongst these\r\nmanifestations nothing has been more remarkable than these fairs for the\r\nrelief of suffering soldiers and their families. And the chief agents in\r\nthese fairs are the women of America.\r\n\r\nI am not accustomed to the language of eulogy. I have never studied the\r\nart of paying compliments to women. But I must say, that if all that has\r\nbeen said by orators and poets since the creation of the world in praise\r\nof women were applied to the women of America, it would not do them\r\njustice for their conduct during this war. I will close by saying, God\r\nbless the women of America!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter to A.G. Hodges, of Kentucky. April 4, 1864_\r\n\r\n\r\nI am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong.\r\nI cannot remember when I did not so think and feel, and yet I have never\r\nunderstood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right\r\nto act officially upon this judgment and feeling. It was in the oath\r\nthat I took, that I would, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect,\r\nand defend the Constitution of the United States. I could not take\r\noffice without taking the oath. Nor was it my view that I might take an\r\noath to get power, and break the oath in using the power. I understood,\r\ntoo, that in ordinary civil administration this oath even forbade me to\r\npractically indulge my primary abstract judgment on the moral question\r\nof slavery. I had publicly declared this many times and in many ways.\r\nAnd I aver that, to this day, I have done no official act in mere\r\ndeference to my abstract feeling and judgment on slavery. I did\r\nunderstand, however, that my oath to preserve the Constitution to the\r\nbest of my ability imposed upon me the duty of preserving, by every\r\nindispensable means, that government--that nation--of which that\r\nConstitution was the organic law. Was it possible to lose the nation and\r\nyet preserve the Constitution? By general law, life and limb must be\r\nprotected, yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life; but a life\r\nis never wisely given to save a limb. I felt that measures, otherwise\r\nunconstitutional, might become lawful by becoming indispensable to the\r\npreservation of the Constitution through the preservation of the nation.\r\nRight or wrong, I assumed this ground; and now avow it. I could not feel\r\nthat, to the best of my ability, I had even tried to preserve the\r\nConstitution, if, to save slavery or any minor matter, I should permit\r\nthe wreck of government, country, and Constitution, all together. When,\r\nearly in the war, General Fremont attempted military emancipation, I\r\nforbade it, because I did not then think it an indispensable necessity.\r\nWhen, a little later, General Cameron, then Secretary of War, suggested\r\nthe arming of the blacks, I objected, because I did not think it an\r\nindispensable necessity. When, still later, General Hunter attempted\r\nmilitary emancipation, I again forbade it, because I did not yet think\r\nthe indispensable necessity had come. When, in March and May and July,\r\n1862, I made earnest and successive appeals to the border States to\r\nfavour compensated emancipation, I believed the indispensable necessity\r\nfor military emancipation and arming the blacks would come, unless\r\naverted by that measure. They declined the proposition, and I was, in my\r\nbest judgment, driven to the alternative of either surrendering the\r\nUnion, and with it the Constitution, or laying strong hand upon the\r\ncoloured element. I chose the latter. In choosing it, I hoped for\r\ngreater gain than loss; but of this I was not entirely confident. More\r\nthan a year of trial now shows no loss by it in our foreign relations,\r\nnone in our home popular sentiment, none in our white military\r\nforce,--no loss by it anyhow or anywhere. On the contrary, it shows a\r\ngain of quite one hundred and thirty thousand soldiers, seamen, and\r\nlabourers. These are palpable facts, about which, as facts, there can be\r\nno cavilling. We have the men, and we could not have had them without\r\nthe measure.\r\n\r\nAnd now let any Union man who complains of the measure, test himself by\r\nwriting down in one line that he is for subduing the rebellion by force\r\nof arms; and in the next, that he is for taking these hundred and thirty\r\nthousand men from the Union side, and placing them where they would be\r\nbut for the measure he condemns. If he cannot face his case so stated,\r\nit is only because he cannot face the truth.\r\n\r\nI add a word which was not in the verbal conversation. In telling this\r\ntale, I attempt no compliment to my own sagacity. I claim not to have\r\ncontrolled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me.\r\nNow, at the end of three years\' struggle, the nation\'s condition is not\r\nwhat either party, or any man, devised or expected. God alone can claim\r\nit. Whither it is tending seems plain. If God now wills the removal of a\r\ngreat wrong, and wills also that we of the North, as well as you of the\r\nSouth, shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong, impartial\r\nhistory will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and\r\ngoodness of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From an Address at a Sanitary Fair in Baltimore. April 18, 1864_\r\n\r\n\r\n... The world has never had a good definition of the word "liberty," and\r\nthe American people, just now, are much in want of one. We all declare\r\nfor liberty; but in using the same word, we do not all mean the same\r\nthing. With some, the word "liberty" may mean for each man to do as he\r\npleases with himself and the product of his labour; while with others,\r\nthe same word may mean for some men to do as they please with other men\r\nand the product of other men\'s labour. Here are two, not only different,\r\nbut incompatible things, called by the same name,--liberty. And it\r\nfollows that each of the things is, by the respective parties, called by\r\ntwo different and incompatible names,--liberty and tyranny.\r\n\r\nThe shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep\'s throat, for which the\r\nsheep thanks the shepherd as his liberator, while the wolf denounces him\r\nfor the same act as the destroyer of liberty, especially as the sheep\r\nwas a black one. Plainly, the sheep and the wolf are not agreed upon a\r\ndefinition of the word "liberty;" and precisely the same difference\r\nprevails to-day, among us human creatures, even in the North, and all\r\nprofessing to love liberty. Hence we behold the process by which\r\nthousands are daily passing from under the yoke of bondage hailed by\r\nsome as the advance of liberty, and bewailed by others as the\r\ndestruction of all liberty. Recently, as it seems, the people of\r\nMaryland have been doing something to define liberty, and thanks to them\r\nthat, in what they have done, the wolf\'s dictionary has been repudiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter to General Grant. April 30, 1864_\r\n\r\n\r\nNot expecting to see you again before the spring campaign opens, I wish\r\nto express in this way my entire satisfaction with what you have done up\r\nto this time, so far as I understand it. The particulars of your plans I\r\nneither know nor seek to know. You are vigilant and self-reliant; and,\r\npleased with this, I wish not to obtrude any constraints nor restraints\r\nupon you. While I am very anxious that any great disaster or capture of\r\nour men in great numbers shall be avoided, I know these points are less\r\nlikely to escape your attention than they would be mine. If there is\r\nanything wanting which is within my power to give, do not fail to let me\r\nknow it. And now, with a brave army and a just cause, may God sustain\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From an Address to the 166th Ohio Regiment. August 22, 1864_\r\n\r\n\r\nI almost always feel inclined, when I happen to say anything to\r\nsoldiers, to impress upon them, in a few brief remarks, the importance\r\nof success in this contest. It is not merely for to-day, but for all\r\ntime to come, that we should perpetuate for our children\'s children that\r\ngreat and free government which we have enjoyed all our lives. I beg you\r\nto remember this, not merely for my sake, but for yours. I happen,\r\ntemporarily, to occupy this White House. I am a living witness that any\r\none of your children may look to come here as my father\'s child has. It\r\nis in order that each one of you may have, through this free government\r\nwhich we have enjoyed, an open field and a fair chance for your\r\nindustry, enterprise, and intelligence; that you may all have equal\r\nprivileges in the race of life, with all its desirable human\r\naspirations. It is for this the struggle should be maintained, that we\r\nmay not lose our birthright--not only for one, but for two or three\r\nyears. The nation is worth fighting for, to secure such an inestimable\r\njewel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reply to a Serenade. November 10, 1864_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has long been a grave question whether any government not too strong\r\nfor the liberties of its people, can be strong enough to maintain its\r\nexistence in great emergencies. On this point the present rebellion\r\nbrought our Republic to a severe test; and a presidential election,\r\noccurring in regular course during the rebellion, added not a little to\r\nthe strain.\r\n\r\nIf the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their strength by\r\nthe rebellion, must they not fail when divided and partially paralyzed\r\nby a political war among themselves? But the election was a necessity.\r\nWe cannot have free government without elections; and if the rebellion\r\ncould force us to forego or postpone a national election, it might\r\nfairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us. The strife of the\r\nelection is but human nature practically applied to the facts of the\r\ncase. What has occurred in this case must ever occur in similar cases.\r\nHuman nature will not change. In any future great national trial,\r\ncompared with the men of this, we shall have as weak and as strong, as\r\nsilly and as wise, as bad and as good. Let us, therefore, study the\r\nincidents of this as philosophy to learn wisdom from, and none of them\r\nas wrongs to be revenged. But the election, along with its incidental\r\nand undesirable strife, has done good too. It has demonstrated that a\r\npeople\'s government can sustain a national election in the midst of a\r\ngreat civil war. Gold is good in its place, but living, brave, patriotic\r\nmen are better than gold.\r\n\r\nBut the rebellion continues; and now that the election is over, may not\r\nall having a common interest reunite in a common effort to save our\r\ncommon country? For my own part, I have striven and shall strive to\r\navoid placing any obstacle in the way. So long as I have been here, I\r\nhave not willingly planted a thorn in any man\'s bosom. While I am deeply\r\nsensible to the high compliment of a re-election, and duly grateful as I\r\ntrust to Almighty God for having directed my countrymen to a right\r\nconclusion, as I think, for their own good, it adds nothing to my\r\nsatisfaction that any other man may be disappointed or pained by the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nMay I ask those who have not differed with me, to join with me in this\r\nsame spirit towards those who have? And now let me close by asking three\r\nhearty cheers for our brave soldiers and seamen, and their gallant and\r\nskilful commanders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Letter to Mrs. Bixley, of Boston. November 21, 1864_\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Madam, I have been shown in the files of the War Department a\r\nstatement of the Adjutant-General of Massachusetts that you are the\r\nmother of five sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle. I\r\nfeel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine which should\r\nattempt to beguile you from the grief of a loss so overwhelming. But I\r\ncannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found\r\nin the thanks of the Republic they died to save. I pray that our\r\nheavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement, and leave\r\nyou only the cherished memory of the loved and lost, and the solemn\r\npride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the\r\naltar of freedom.\r\n\r\n     Yours very sincerely and respectfully,\r\n       ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter to General Grant. Washington. January 19, 1865_\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease read and answer this letter as though I was not President, but\r\nonly a friend. My son, now in his twenty-second year, having graduated\r\nat Harvard, wishes to see something of the war before it ends. I do not\r\nwish to put him in the ranks, nor yet to give him a commission, to which\r\nthose who have already served long are better entitled, and better\r\nqualified to hold. Could he, without embarrassment to you or detriment\r\nto the service, go into your military family with some nominal rank, I,\r\nand not the public, furnishing his necessary means? If no, say so\r\nwithout the least hesitation, because I am as anxious and as deeply\r\ninterested that you shall not be encumbered as you can be yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Second Inaugural Address. March 4, 1865_\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-countrymen, At this second appearance to take the oath of the\r\nPresidential office, there is less occasion for an extended address than\r\nthere was at the first. Then a statement, somewhat in detail, of a\r\ncourse to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration\r\nof four years, during which public declarations have been constantly\r\ncalled forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still\r\nabsorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little\r\nthat is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all\r\nelse chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself; and\r\nit is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With\r\nhigh hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts were\r\nanxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it,--all\r\nsought to avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from\r\nthis place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war,\r\ninsurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without\r\nwar,--seeking to dissolve the Union, and divide effects, by negotiation.\r\nBoth parties deprecated war; but one of them would make war rather than\r\nlet the nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let\r\nit perish. And the war came.\r\n\r\nOne-eighth of the whole population were coloured slaves, not distributed\r\ngenerally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it.\r\nThese slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that\r\nthis interest was, somehow, the cause of the war. To strengthen,\r\nperpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the\r\ninsurgents would rend the Union, even by war; while the government\r\nclaimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement\r\nof it....\r\n\r\nWith malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the\r\nright, as God gives us to see the right,--let us strive on to finish the\r\nwork we are in: to bind up the nation\'s wounds; to care for him who\r\nshall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan; to do all\r\nwhich may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves,\r\nand with all nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Letter to Thurlow Weed. Executive Mansion, Washington. March 15,\r\n1865_\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Weed, Every one likes a compliment. Thank you for yours on my\r\nlittle notification speech and on the recent inaugural address. I expect\r\nthe latter to wear as well as--perhaps better than--anything I have\r\nproduced; but I believe it is not immediately popular. Men are not\r\nflattered by being shown that there has been a difference of purpose\r\nbetween the Almighty and them. To deny it, however, in this case, is to\r\ndeny that there is a God governing the world. It is a truth which I\r\nthought needed to be told, and, as whatever of humiliation there is in\r\nit falls most directly on myself, I thought others might afford for me\r\nto tell it.\r\n\r\n     Truly yours,\r\n       A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From an Address to an Indiana Regiment. March 17, 1865_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are but few aspects of this great war on which I have not already\r\nexpressed my views by speaking or writing. There is one--the recent\r\neffort of "Our erring brethren," sometimes so called, to employ the\r\nslaves in their armies. The great question with them has been, "Will the\r\nnegro fight for them?" They ought to know better than we, and doubtless\r\ndo know better than we. I may incidentally remark, that having in my\r\nlife heard many arguments--or strings of words meant to pass for\r\narguments--intended to show that the negro ought to be a slave,--if he\r\nshall now really fight to keep himself a slave, it will be a far better\r\nargument why he should remain a slave than I have ever before heard. He,\r\nperhaps, ought to be a slave if he desires it ardently enough to fight\r\nfor it. Or, if one out of four will, for his own freedom fight to keep\r\nthe other three in slavery, he ought to be a slave for his selfish\r\nmeanness. I have always thought that all men should be free; but if any\r\nshould be slaves, it should be first those who desire it for themselves,\r\nand secondly those who desire it for others. Whenever I hear any one\r\narguing for slavery, I feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him\r\npersonally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From his Reply to a Serenade. Lincoln\'s Last Public Address. April 11,\r\n1865_\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, We meet this evening, not in sorrow but in gladness of\r\nheart. The evacuation of Richmond and Petersburg, and the surrender of\r\nthe principal insurgent army, give the hope of a just and speedy peace,\r\nthe joyous expression of which cannot be restrained. In all this joy,\r\nhowever, He from whom all blessings flow must not be forgotten. A call\r\nfor a national thanksgiving is in the course of preparation, and will be\r\nduly promulgated. Nor must those whose harder part give us the cause for\r\nrejoicing be overlooked. Their honours must not be parcelled out with\r\nothers. I, myself, was near the front, and had the high pleasure of\r\ntransmitting much of the good news to you; but no part of the honour for\r\nplan or execution is mine. To General Grant, his skilful officers and\r\nbrave men, all belongs. The gallant navy stood ready, but was not in\r\nreach to take an active part.\r\n\r\nBy these recent successes the reinauguration of the national\r\nauthority,--reconstruction,--which has had a large share of thought from\r\nthe first, is pressed much more closely upon our attention. It is\r\nfraught with great difficulty. Unlike a case of war between independent\r\nnations, there is no organized organ for us to treat with,--no one man\r\nhas authority to give up the rebellion for any other man. We simply must\r\nbegin with and mould from disorganized and discordant elements. Nor is\r\nit a small additional embarrassment that we, the loyal people, differ\r\namong ourselves as to the mode, manner, and measure of reconstruction.\r\nAs a general rule I abstain from reading the reports of attacks upon\r\nmyself, wishing not to be provoked by that to which I cannot properly\r\noffer an answer. In spite of this precaution, however, it comes to my\r\nknowledge that I am much censured for some supposed agency in setting up\r\nand seeking to sustain the new State government of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nIn this I have done just so much as, and no more than, the public knows.\r\nIn the annual message of December 1863, and in the accompanying\r\nproclamation, I presented a plan of reconstruction, as the phrase goes,\r\nwhich I promised, if adopted by any State, should be acceptable to and\r\nsustained by the executive government of the nation. I distinctly stated\r\nthat this was not the only plan which might possibly be acceptable, and\r\nI also distinctly protested that the executive claimed no right to say\r\nwhen or whether members should be admitted to seats in Congress from\r\nsuch States. This plan was in advance submitted to the then Cabinet, and\r\napproved by every member of it....\r\n\r\nWhen the message of 1863, with the plan before mentioned, reached New\r\nOrleans, General Banks wrote me that he was confident that the people,\r\nwith his military co-operation, would reconstruct substantially on that\r\nplan. I wrote him and some of them to try it. They tried it, and the\r\nresult is known. Such has been my only agency in getting up the\r\nLouisiana government. As to sustaining it, my promise is out, as before\r\nstated. But as bad promises are better broken than kept, I shall treat\r\nthis as a bad promise and break it, whenever I shall be convinced that\r\nkeeping it is adverse to the public interest; but I have not yet been so\r\nconvinced. I have been shown a letter on this subject, supposed to be an\r\nable one, in which the writer expresses regret that my mind has not\r\nseemed to be definitely fixed upon the question whether the seceded\r\nStates, so called, are in the Union or out of it. It would perhaps add\r\nastonishment to his regret were he to learn that since I have found\r\nprofessed Union men endeavouring to answer that question, I have\r\npurposely forborne any public expression upon it....\r\n\r\nWe all agree that the seceded States, so called, are out of their proper\r\npractical relation with the Union, and that the sole object of the\r\ngovernment, civil and military, in regard to those States, is to again\r\nget them into that proper practical relation. I believe that it is not\r\nonly possible, but in fact easier, to do this without deciding or even\r\nconsidering whether these States have ever been out of the Union, than\r\nwith it. Finding themselves safely at home, it would be utterly\r\nimmaterial whether they had ever been abroad. Let us all join in doing\r\nthe acts necessary to restoring the proper practical relations between\r\nthese States and the Union, and each for ever after innocently indulge\r\nhis own opinion whether in doing the acts he brought the States from\r\nwithout into the Union, or only gave them proper assistance, they never\r\nhaving been out of it. The amount of constituency, so to speak, on which\r\nthe new Louisiana government rests, would be more satisfactory to all if\r\nit contained forty thousand, or thirty thousand, or even twenty\r\nthousand, instead of only about twelve thousand as it does. It is also\r\nunsatisfactory to some that the elective franchise is not given to the\r\ncoloured man. I would myself prefer that it were now conferred on the\r\nvery intelligent, and on those who serve our cause as soldiers.\r\n\r\nStill, the question is not whether the Louisiana government, as it\r\nstands, is quite all that is desirable. The question is, will it be\r\nwiser to take it as it is and help to improve it, or to reject and\r\ndisperse it? Can Louisiana be brought into proper practical relation\r\nwith the Union sooner by sustaining or by discarding her new State\r\ngovernment? Some twelve thousand voters in the heretofore slave State of\r\nLouisiana have sworn allegiance to the Union, assumed to be the rightful\r\npolitical power of the State, held elections, organized a State\r\ngovernment, adopted a free-State constitution, giving the benefit of\r\npublic schools equally to black and white, and empowering the\r\nlegislature to confer the elective franchise upon the coloured man.\r\nTheir legislature has already voted to ratify the constitutional\r\namendment recently passed by Congress, abolishing slavery throughout\r\nthe nation. These twelve thousand persons are thus fully committed to\r\nthe Union and to perpetual freedom in the State,--committed to the very\r\nthings, and nearly all the things, the nation wants,--and they ask the\r\nnation\'s recognition and its assistance to make good their committal.\r\n\r\nIf we reject and spurn them, we do our utmost to disorganize and\r\ndisperse them. We, in effect, say to the white man: You are worthless or\r\nworse; we will neither help you, nor be helped by you. To the blacks, we\r\nsay: This cup of liberty, which these, your old masters, hold to your\r\nlips, we will dash from you, and leave you to the chances of gathering\r\nthe spilled and scattered contents in some vague and undefined when,\r\nwhere, and how. If this course, discouraging and paralyzing both white\r\nand black, has any tendency to bring Louisiana into proper, practical\r\nrelations with the Union, I have so far been unable to perceive it. If,\r\non the contrary, we recognize and sustain the new government of\r\nLouisiana, the converse of all this is made true. We encourage the\r\nhearts and nerve the arms of twelve thousand to adhere to their work,\r\nand argue for it, and proselyte for it, and fight for it, and feed it,\r\nand grow it, and ripen it to a complete success. The coloured man, too,\r\nin seeing all united for him, is inspired with vigilance, and energy,\r\nand daring to the same end. Grant that he desires the elective\r\nfranchise, will he not attain it sooner by saving the already advanced\r\nsteps towards it, than by running backward over them?\r\n\r\n... I repeat the question, Can Louisiana be brought into proper\r\npractical relation with the Union sooner by sustaining or by discarding\r\nher new State government?\r\n\r\n... What has been said of Louisiana will apply generally to other\r\nStates. And yet so great peculiarities pertain to each State, and such\r\nimportant and sudden changes occur in the same State, and withal so new\r\nand unprecedented is the whole case, that no exclusive and inflexible\r\nplan can safely be prescribed as to details and collaterals. Such\r\nexclusive and inflexible plan would surely become a new entanglement.\r\nImportant principles may and must be inflexible. In the present\r\nsituation, as the phrase goes, it may be my duty to make some new\r\nannouncement to the people of the South. I am considering, and shall not\r\nfail to act when satisfied that action will be proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCOLN\'S ENTRY INTO RICHMOND THE DAY AFTER IT WAS TAKEN\r\n\r\n_As Described at that time by a Writer in the "Atlantic Monthly"_\r\n\r\nThey gathered around the President, ran ahead, hovered about the flanks\r\nof the little company, and hung like a dark cloud upon the rear. Men,\r\nwomen and children joined the constantly-increasing throng. They came\r\nfrom all the by-streets, running in breathless haste, shouting and\r\nhallooing, and dancing with delight. The men threw up their hats, the\r\nwomen waved their bonnets and handkerchiefs, clapped their hands, and\r\nsang, "Glory to God! glory, glory!" rendering all the praise to God, who\r\nhad heard their wailings in the past, their moanings for wives,\r\nhusbands, children, and friends sold out of their sight; had given them\r\nfreedom, and after long years of waiting had permitted them thus\r\nunexpectedly to behold the face of their great benefactor.\r\n\r\n"I thank you, dear Jesus, that I behold President Linkum!" was the\r\nexclamation of a woman who stood upon the threshold of her humble home,\r\nand with streaming eyes and clasped hands gave thanks aloud to the\r\nSaviour of men.\r\n\r\nAnother, more demonstrative in her joy, was jumping and striking her\r\nhands with all her might, crying, "Bless de Lord! Bless de Lord! Bless\r\nde Lord!" as if there could be no end to her thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nThe air rang with a tumultuous chorus of voices. The street became\r\nalmost impassable on account of the increasing multitude, till soldiers\r\nwere summoned to clear the way....\r\n\r\nThe walk was long, and the President halted a moment to rest. "May de\r\ngood Lord bless you, President Linkum!" said an old negro, removing his\r\nhat and bowing, with tears of joy rolling down his cheeks. The President\r\nremoved his own hat, and bowed in silence; but it was a bow which upset\r\nthe forms, laws, customs, and ceremonies of centuries. It was a\r\ndeath-shock to chivalry and a mortal wound to caste. "Recognize a\r\nnigger! Fough!" A woman in an adjoining house beheld it, and turned from\r\nthe scene in unspeakable disgust.\r\n\r\n\r\n     (The following nine anecdotes were related by Frank B. Carpenter,\r\n     the painter, who, while executing his picture of the first reading\r\n     in cabinet council of the Emancipation Proclamation, had the\r\n     freedom of Mr. Lincoln\'s private office and saw much of the\r\n     President while he posed, and whose relations with him became of an\r\n     intimate character.)\r\n\r\n\r\n"YOU DON\'T WEAR HOOPS--AND I WILL ... PARDON YOUR BROTHER"\r\n\r\nA distinguished citizen of Ohio had an appointment with the President\r\none evening at six o\'clock. As he entered the vestibule of the White\r\nHouse, his attention was attracted by a poorly-clad young woman who was\r\nviolently sobbing. He asked her the cause of her distress. She said she\r\nhad been ordered away by the servants after vainly waiting many hours to\r\nsee the President about her only brother, who had been condemned to\r\ndeath. Her story was this:--She and her brother were foreigners, and\r\norphans. They had been in this country several years. Her brother\r\nenlisted in the army, but, through bad influences, was induced to\r\ndesert. He was captured, tried and sentenced to be shot--the old story.\r\nThe poor girl had obtained the signatures of some persons who had\r\nformerly known him, to a petition for a pardon, and alone had come to\r\nWashington to lay the case before the President. Thronged as the\r\nwaiting-rooms always were, she had passed the long hours of two days\r\ntrying in vain to get an audience, and had at length been ordered away.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman\'s feelings were touched. He said to her that he had come\r\nto see the President, but did not know as _he_ should succeed. He told\r\nher, however, to follow him upstairs, and he would see what could be\r\ndone for her. Just before reaching the door, Mr. Lincoln came out, and\r\nmeeting his friend said good-humouredly, "Are you not ahead of time?"\r\nThe gentleman showed him his watch, with the hand upon the hour of six.\r\n"Well," returned Mr. Lincoln, "I have been so busy to-day that I have\r\nnot had time to get a lunch. Go in, and sit down; I will be back\r\ndirectly."\r\n\r\nThe gentleman made the young woman accompany him into the office, and,\r\nwhen they were seated, said to her, "Now, my good girl, I want you to\r\nmuster all the courage you have in the world. When the President comes\r\nback, he will sit down in that arm-chair. I shall get up to speak to\r\nhim, and as I do so you must force yourself between us, and insist upon\r\nthe examination of your papers, telling him it is a case of life and\r\ndeath, and admits of no delay." These instructions were carried out to\r\nthe letter. Mr. Lincoln was at first somewhat surprised at the apparent\r\nforwardness of the young woman, but observing her distressed appearance,\r\nhe ceased conversation with his friend, and commenced an examination of\r\nthe document she had placed in his hands. Glancing from it to the face\r\nof the petitioner, whose tears had broken forth afresh, he studied its\r\nexpression for a moment, and then his eye fell upon her scanty but neat\r\ndress. Instantly his face lighted up. "My poor girl," said he, "you have\r\ncome here with no governor, or senator, or member of Congress, to plead\r\nyour cause. You seem honest and truthful; _and you don\'t wear\r\nhoops_--and I will be whipped but I will pardon your brother."\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS JOY IN GIVING A PARDON\r\n\r\nOne night Schuyler Colfax left all other business to ask him to respite\r\nthe son of a constituent, who was sentenced to be shot, at Davenport,\r\nfor desertion. He heard the story with his usual patience, though he was\r\nwearied out with incessant calls, and anxious for rest, and then\r\nreplied:--"Some of our generals complain that I impair discipline and\r\nsubordination in the army by my pardons and respites, but it makes me\r\nrested, after a hard day\'s work, if I can find some good excuse for\r\nsaving a man\'s life, and I go to bed happy as I think how joyous the\r\nsigning of my name will make him and his family and his friends." And\r\nwith a happy smile beaming over that care-furrowed face, he signed that\r\nname that saved that life.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS SIMPLICITY AND UNOSTENTATIOUSNESS\r\n\r\nThe simplicity and absence of all ostentation on the part of Mr.\r\nLincoln, is well illustrated by an incident which occurred on the\r\noccasion of a visit he made to Commodore Porter, at Fortress Monroe.\r\nNoticing that the banks of the river were dotted with flowers, he said:\r\n"Commodore, Tad (the pet name for his youngest son, who had accompanied\r\nhim on the excursion) is very fond of flowers; won\'t you let a couple of\r\nmen take a boat and go with him for an hour or two, along the banks of\r\nthe river, and gather the flowers?" Look at this picture, and then\r\nendeavour to imagine the head of a European nation making a similar\r\nrequest, in this humble way, of one of his subordinates!\r\n\r\n\r\nA PENITENT MAN CAN BE PARDONED\r\n\r\nOne day I took a couple of friends from New York upstairs, who wished to\r\nbe introduced to the President. It was after the hour for business\r\ncalls, and we found him alone, and, for _once_, at leisure. Soon after\r\nthe introduction, one of my friends took occasion to indorse, very\r\ndecidedly, the President\'s Amnesty Proclamation, which had been severely\r\ncensured by many friends of the Administration. Mr. S----\'s approval\r\ntouched Mr. Lincoln. He said, with a great deal of emphasis, and with an\r\nexpression of countenance I shall never forget: "When a man is sincerely\r\n_penitent_ for his misdeeds, and gives satisfactory evidence of the\r\nsame, he can safely be pardoned, and there is no exception to the rule!"\r\n\r\n\r\n"KEEP SILENCE, AND WE\'LL GET YOU SAFE ACROSS"\r\n\r\nAt the White House one day some gentlemen were present from the West,\r\nexcited and troubled about the commissions and omissions of the\r\nAdministration. The President heard them patiently, and then replied:\r\n"Gentlemen, suppose all the property you were worth was in gold, and you\r\nhad put it in the hands of Blondin to carry across the Niagara River on\r\na rope, would you shake the cable, or keep shouting out to him,\r\n\'Blondin, stand up a little straighter--Blondin, stoop a little more--go\r\na little faster--lean a little more to the north--lean a little more to\r\nthe south?\' No, you would hold your breath as well as your tongue, and\r\nkeep your hands off until he was safe over. The Government are carrying\r\nan immense weight. Untold treasures are in their hands. They are doing\r\nthe very best they can. Don\'t badger them. Keep silence, and we\'ll get\r\nyou safe across."\r\n\r\n\r\nREBUFF TO A MAN WITH A SMALL CLAIM\r\n\r\nDuring a public "reception," a farmer, from one of the border counties\r\nof Virginia, told the President that the Union soldiers, in passing his\r\nfarm, had helped themselves not only to hay, but his horse, and he hoped\r\nthe President would urge the proper officer to consider his claim\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln said that this reminded him of an old acquaintance of his,\r\n"Jack Chase," who used to be a lumberman on the Illinois, a steady,\r\nsober man, and the best raftsman on the river. It was quite a trick,\r\ntwenty-five years ago, to take the logs over the rapids; but he was\r\nskilful with a raft, and always kept her straight in the channel.\r\nFinally a steamer was put on, and Jack was made captain of her. He\r\nalways used to take the wheel going through the rapids. One day when the\r\nboat was plunging and wallowing along the boiling current, and Jack\'s\r\nutmost vigilance was being exercised to keep her in the narrow channel,\r\na boy pulled his coat-tail, and hailed him with: "Say, Mister Captain! I\r\nwish you would just stop your boat a minute--I\'ve lost my apple\r\noverboard!"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT\'S SILENCE OVER CRITICISMS\r\n\r\nThe President was once speaking about an attack made on him by the\r\nCommittee on the Conduct of the War for a certain alleged blunder, or\r\nsomething worse, in the Southwest--the matter involved being one which\r\nhad fallen directly under the observation of the officer to whom he was\r\ntalking, who possessed official evidence completely upsetting all the\r\nconclusions of the Committee.\r\n\r\n"Might it not be well for me," queried the officer, "to set this matter\r\nright in a letter to some paper, stating the facts as they actually\r\ntranspired?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," replied the President, "at least, not now. If I were to try to\r\nread, much less answer, all the attacks made on me, this shop might as\r\nwell be closed for any other business. I do the very best I know\r\nhow--the very best I can; and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If\r\nthe end brings me out all right, what is said against me won\'t amount to\r\nanything. If the end brings me out wrong, ten angels swearing I was\r\nright would make no difference."\r\n\r\n\r\n"GLAD OF IT"\r\n\r\nOn the occasion when the telegram from Cumberland Gap reached Mr.\r\nLincoln that "firing was heard in the direction of Knoxville," he\r\nremarked that he was "glad of it." Some person present, who had the\r\nperils of Burnside\'s position uppermost in his mind, could, not see\r\n_why_ Mr. Lincoln should be _glad_ of it, and so expressed himself.\r\n"Why, you see," responded the President, "it reminds me of Mistress\r\nSallie Ward, a neighbour of mine, who had a very large family.\r\nOccasionally one of her numerous progeny would be heard crying in some\r\nout-of-the-way place, upon which Mrs. Ward would exclaim, \'There\'s one\r\nof my children that isn\'t dead yet!\'"\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS DEMOCRATIC BEARING\r\n\r\nThe evening before I left Washington an incident occurred, illustrating\r\nvery perfectly the character of the man. For two days my large painting\r\nhad been on exhibition, upon its completion, in the East Room, which had\r\nbeen thronged with visitors. Late in the afternoon of the second day,\r\nthe "black-horse cavalry" escort drew up as usual in front of the\r\nportico, preparatory to the President\'s leaving for the "Soldiers\'\r\nHome," where he spent the midsummer nights. While the carriage was\r\nwaiting, I looked around for him, wishing to say a farewell word,\r\nknowing that I should have no other opportunity. Presently I saw him\r\nstanding halfway between the portico and the gateway leading to the War\r\nDepartment, leaning against the iron fence--one arm thrown over the\r\nrailing, and one foot on the stone coping which supports it, evidently\r\nhaving been intercepted, on his way in from the War Department, by a\r\nplain-looking man, who was giving him, very diffidently, an account of a\r\ndifficulty which he had been unable to have rectified. While waiting, I\r\nwalked out leisurely to the President\'s side. He said very little to the\r\nman, but was intently studying the expression of his face while he was\r\nnarrating his trouble. When he had finished, Mr. Lincoln said to him,\r\n"Have you a blank card?" The man searched his pockets, but finding none,\r\na gentleman standing near, who had overheard the question, came forward,\r\nand said, "Here is one, Mr. President." Several persons had, in the\r\nmeantime, gathered around. Taking the card and a pencil, Mr. Lincoln\r\nsat down upon the stone coping, which is not more than five or six\r\ninches above the pavement, presenting almost the appearance of sitting\r\nupon the pavement itself, and wrote an order upon the card to the proper\r\nofficial to "examine this man\'s case." While writing this, I observed\r\nseveral persons passing down the promenade, smiling at each other, at\r\nwhat I presume they thought the undignified appearance of the Head of\r\nthe Nation, who, however, seemed utterly unconscious, either of any\r\nimpropriety in the action, or of attracting any attention. To me it was\r\nnot only a touching picture of the native goodness of the man, but of\r\ninnate nobility of character, exemplified not so much by a disregard of\r\nconventionalities, as in unconsciousness that there _could_ be any\r\nbreach of etiquette, or dignity, in the manner of an honest attempt to\r\nserve, or secure justice to a citizen of the Republic, however humble he\r\nmay be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n     EVERYMAN,\r\n     I WILL GO WITH THEE\r\n     & BE THY GUIDE\r\n     IN THY MOST NEED\r\n     TO GO BY THY SIDE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SPEECHES AND LETTERS OF ABRAHAM\r\nLINCOLN, 1832-1865***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 14721-8.txt or 14721-8.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/4/7/2/14721\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
