"We would see a sign":\r\n     The word within a word, unable to speak a word,\r\n     Swaddled with darkness. In the juvescence of the year\r\n     Came Christ the tiger\r\n\r\n     In depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas,\r\n     To be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk\r\n     Among whispers; by Mr. Silvero\r\n     With caressing hands, at Limoges\r\n     Who walked all night in the next room;\r\n     By Hakagawa, bowing among the Titians;\r\n     By Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room\r\n     Shifting the candles; Fraulein von Kulp\r\n     Who turned in the hall, one hand on the door. Vacant shuttles\r\n     Weave the wind. I have no ghosts,\r\n     An old man in a draughty house\r\n     Under a windy knob.\r\n\r\n     After such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now\r\n     History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors\r\n     And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,\r\n     Guides us by vanities. Think now\r\n     She gives when our attention is distracted\r\n     And what she gives, gives with such supple confusions\r\n     That the giving famishes the craving. Gives too late\r\n     What\'s not believed in, or if still believed,\r\n     In memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soon\r\n     Into weak hands, what\'s thought can be dispensed with\r\n     Till the refusal propagates a fear. Think\r\n     Neither fear nor courage saves us. Unnatural vices\r\n     Are fathered by our heroism. Virtues\r\n     Are forced upon us by our impudent crimes.\r\n     These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.\r\n\r\n     The tiger springs in the new year. Us he devours. Think at last\r\n     We have not reached conclusion, when I\r\n     Stiffen in a rented house. Think at last\r\n     I have not made this show purposelessly\r\n     And it is not by any concitation\r\n     Of the backward devils.\r\n     I would meet you upon this honestly.\r\n     I that was near your heart was removed therefrom\r\n     To lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition.\r\n     I have lost my passion: why should I need to keep it\r\n     Since what is kept must be adulterated?\r\n     I have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch:\r\n     How should I use it for your closer contact?\r\n\r\n     These with a thousand small deliberations\r\n     Protract the profit of their chilled delirium,\r\n     Excite the membrane, when the sense has cooled,\r\n     With pungent sauces, multiply variety\r\n     In a wilderness of mirrors. What will the spider do,\r\n     Suspend its operations, will the weevil\r\n     Delay? De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, whirled\r\n     Beyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear\r\n     In fractured atoms. Gull against the wind, in the windy straits\r\n     Of Belle Isle, or running on the Horn,\r\n     White feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims,\r\n     And an old man driven by the Trades\r\n     To a sleepy corner.\r\n\r\n                       Tenants of the house,\r\n     Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBurbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar\r\n\r\n       Tra-la-la-la-la-la-laire--nil nisi divinum stabile\r\n       est; caetera fumus--the gondola stopped, the old\r\n       palace was there, how charming its grey and pink--\r\n       goats and monkeys, with such hair too!--so the\r\n       countess passed on until she came through the\r\n       little park, where Niobe presented her with a\r\n       cabinet, and so departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Burbank crossed a little bridge\r\n     Descending at a small hotel;\r\n     Princess Volupine arrived,\r\n     They were together, and he fell.\r\n\r\n     Defunctive music under sea\r\n     Passed seaward with the passing bell\r\n     Slowly: the God Hercules\r\n     Had left him, that had loved him well.\r\n\r\n     The horses, under the axletree\r\n     Beat up the dawn from Istria\r\n     With even feet. Her shuttered barge\r\n     Burned on the water all the day.\r\n\r\n     But this or such was Bleistein\'s way:\r\n     A saggy bending of the knees\r\n     And elbows, with the palms turned out,\r\n     Chicago Semite Viennese.\r\n\r\n     A lustreless protrusive eye\r\n     Stares from the protozoic slime\r\n     At a perspective of Canaletto.\r\n     The smoky candle end of time\r\n\r\n     Declines. On the Rialto once.\r\n     The rats are underneath the piles.\r\n     The jew is underneath the lot.\r\n     Money in furs. The boatman smiles,\r\n\r\n     Princess Volupine extends\r\n     A meagre, blue-nailed, phthisic hand\r\n     To climb the waterstair. Lights, lights,\r\n     She entertains Sir Ferdinand\r\n\r\n     Klein. Who clipped the lion\'s wings\r\n     And flea\'d his rump and pared his claws?\r\n     Thought Burbank, meditating on\r\n     Time\'s ruins, and the seven laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweeney Erect\r\n\r\n                           And the trees about me,\r\n       Let them be dry and leafless; let the rocks\r\n       Groan with continual surges; and behind me\r\n       Make all a desolation. Look, look, wenches!\r\n\r\n\r\n     Paint me a cavernous waste shore\r\n     Cast in the unstilted Cyclades,\r\n     Paint me the bold anfractuous rocks\r\n     Faced by the snarled and yelping seas.\r\n\r\n     Display me Aeolus above\r\n     Reviewing the insurgent gales\r\n     Which tangle Ariadne\'s hair\r\n     And swell with haste the perjured sails.\r\n\r\n     Morning stirs the feet and hands\r\n     (Nausicaa and Polypheme),\r\n     Gesture of orang-outang\r\n     Rises from the sheets in steam.\r\n\r\n     This withered root of knots of hair\r\n     Slitted below and gashed with eyes,\r\n     This oval O cropped out with teeth:\r\n     The sickle motion from the thighs\r\n\r\n     Jackknifes upward at the knees\r\n     Then straightens out from heel to hip\r\n     Pushing the framework of the bed\r\n     And clawing at the pillow slip.\r\n\r\n     Sweeney addressed full length to shave\r\n     Broadbottomed, pink from nape to base,\r\n     Knows the female temperament\r\n     And wipes the suds around his face.\r\n\r\n     (The lengthened shadow of a man\r\n     Is history, said Emerson\r\n     Who had not seen the silhouette\r\n     Of Sweeney straddled in the sun).\r\n\r\n     Tests the razor on his leg\r\n     Waiting until the shriek subsides.\r\n     The epileptic on the bed\r\n     Curves backward, clutching at her sides.\r\n\r\n     The ladies of the corridor\r\n     Find themselves involved, disgraced,\r\n     Call witness to their principles\r\n     And deprecate the lack of taste\r\n\r\n     Observing that hysteria\r\n     Might easily be misunderstood;\r\n     Mrs. Turner intimates\r\n     It does the house no sort of good.\r\n\r\n     But Doris, towelled from the bath,\r\n     Enters padding on broad feet,\r\n     Bringing sal volatile\r\n     And a glass of brandy neat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Cooking Egg\r\n\r\n       En l\'an trentiesme de mon aage\r\n       Que toutes mes hontes j\'ay beues...\r\n\r\n\r\n     Pipit sate upright in her chair\r\n       Some distance from where I was sitting;\r\n     Views of the Oxford Colleges\r\n       Lay on the table, with the knitting.\r\n\r\n     Daguerreotypes and silhouettes,\r\n       Her grandfather and great great aunts,\r\n     Supported on the mantelpiece\r\n       An Invitation to the Dance.\r\n      .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n     I shall not want Honour in Heaven\r\n       For I shall meet Sir Philip Sidney\r\n     And have talk with Coriolanus\r\n       And other heroes of that kidney.\r\n\r\n     I shall not want Capital in Heaven\r\n       For I shall meet Sir Alfred Mond:\r\n     We two shall lie together, lapt\r\n       In a five per cent Exchequer Bond.\r\n\r\n     I shall not want Society in Heaven,\r\n       Lucretia Borgia shall be my Bride;\r\n     Her anecdotes will be more amusing\r\n       Than Pipit\'s experience could provide.\r\n\r\n     I shall not want Pipit in Heaven:\r\n       Madame Blavatsky will instruct me\r\n     In the Seven Sacred Trances;\r\n       Piccarda de Donati will conduct me.\r\n\r\n      .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n\r\n     But where is the penny world I bought\r\n       To eat with Pipit behind the screen?\r\n     The red-eyed scavengers are creeping\r\n       From Kentish Town and Golder\'s Green;\r\n\r\n     Where are the eagles and the trumpets?\r\n\r\n       Buried beneath some snow-deep Alps.\r\n     Over buttered scones and crumpets\r\n       Weeping, weeping multitudes\r\n     Droop in a hundred A.B.C.\'s\r\n\r\n     ["ABC\'s" signifes endemic teashops, found in all parts of\r\n     London.

IGNATII AD TRALLIANOS.\r\n\r\n       And when this epistle is read among you, cause\r\n       that it be read also in the church of the\r\n       Laodiceans.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The broad-backed hippopotamus\r\n     Rests on his belly in the mud;\r\n     Although he seems so firm to us\r\n     He is merely flesh and blood.\r\n\r\n     Flesh-and-blood is weak and frail,\r\n     Susceptible to nervous shock;\r\n     While the True Church can never fail\r\n     For it is based upon a rock.\r\n\r\n     The hippo\'s feeble steps may err\r\n     In compassing material ends,\r\n     While the True Church need never stir\r\n     To gather in its dividends.\r\n\r\n     The \'potamus can never reach\r\n     The mango on the mango-tree;\r\n     But fruits of pomegranate and peach\r\n     Refresh the Church from over sea.\r\n\r\n     At mating time the hippo\'s voice\r\n     Betrays inflexions hoarse and odd,\r\n     But every week we hear rejoice\r\n     The Church, at being one with God.\r\n\r\n     The hippopotamus\'s day\r\n     Is passed in sleep; at night he hunts;\r\n     God works in a mysterious way-\r\n     The Church can sleep and feed at once.\r\n\r\n     I saw the \'potamus take wing\r\n     Ascending from the damp savannas,\r\n     And quiring angels round him sing\r\n     The praise of God, in loud hosannas.\r\n\r\n     Blood of the Lamb shall wash him clean\r\n     And him shall heavenly arms enfold,\r\n     Among the saints he shall be seen\r\n     Performing on a harp of gold.\r\n\r\n     He shall be washed as white as snow,\r\n     By all the martyr\'d virgins kiss,\r\n     While the True Church remains below\r\n     Wrapt in the old miasmal mist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDans le Restaurant\r\n\r\n     Le garcon d\xc3\xa9labr\xc3\xa9 qui n\'a rien \xc3\xa0 faire\r\n     Que de se gratter les doigts et se pencher sur mon \xc3\xa9paule:\r\n       "Dans mon pays il fera temps pluvieux,\r\n       Du vent, du grand soleil, et de la pluie;\r\n       C\'est ce qu\'on appelle le jour de lessive des gueux."\r\n     (Bavard, baveux, \xc3\xa0 la croupe arrondie,\r\n     Je te prie, au moins, ne bave pas dans la soupe).\r\n       "Les saules

pertes, et la cargaison d\'etain:\r\n     Un courant de sous-mer l\'emporta tres loin,\r\n     Le repassant aux \xc3\xa9tapes de sa vie ant\xc3\xa9rieure.\r\n     Figurez-vous donc, c\'etait un sort penible;\r\n     Cependant, ce fut jadis un bel homme, de haute taille.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhispers of Immortality\r\n\r\n     Webster was much possessed by death\r\n     And saw the skull beneath the skin;\r\n     And breastless creatures under ground\r\n     Leaned backward with a lipless grin.\r\n\r\n     Daffodil bulbs instead of balls\r\n     Stared from the sockets of the eyes!\r\n     He knew that thought clings round dead limbs\r\n     Tightening its lusts and luxuries.\r\n\r\n     Donne, I suppose, was such another\r\n     Who found no substitute for sense;\r\n     To seize and clutch and penetrate,\r\n     Expert beyond experience,\r\n\r\n     He knew the anguish of the marrow\r\n     The ague of the skeleton;\r\n     No contact possible to flesh\r\n     Allayed the fever of the bone.\r\n\r\n    .    .    .    .    .\r\n\r\n     Grishkin is nice: her Russian eye\r\n     Is underlined for emphasis;\r\n     Uncorseted, her friendly bust\r\n     Gives promise of pneumatic bliss.\r\n\r\n     The couched Brazilian jaguar\r\n     Compels the scampering marmoset\r\n     With subtle effluence of cat;\r\n     Grishkin has a maisonette;\r\n\r\n     The sleek Brazilian jaguar\r\n     Does not in its arboreal gloom\r\n     Distil so rank a feline smell\r\n     As Grishkin in a drawing-room.\r\n\r\n     And even the Abstract Entities\r\n     Circumambulate her charm;\r\n     But our lot crawls between dry ribs\r\n     To keep our metaphysics warm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Eliot\'s Sunday Morning Service\r\n\r\n       Look, look, master, here comes two

    And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:\r\n     Streets that follow like a tedious argument\r\n     Of insidious intent\r\n     To lead you to an overwhelming question....\r\n     Oh, do not

Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,\r\n     Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,\r\n     And seeing that it was a soft October night,\r\n     Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.\r\n\r\n     And indeed there will be time\r\n     For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,\r\n     Rubbing its back upon the window panes;\r\n     There will be time, there will be time\r\n     To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet\r\n     There will be time to murder and create,\r\n     And time for all the works and days of hands\r\n     That lift and drop a question on your plate;\r\n     Time for you and time for me,\r\n     And time yet for a hundred indecisions,\r\n     And for a hundred visions and revisions,\r\n     Before the taking of a toast and tea.\r\n\r\n     In the room the women come and go\r\n     Talking of Michelangelo.\r\n\r\n     And indeed there will be time\r\n     To wonder, "Do I dare?" and, "Do I dare?"\r\n     Time to turn back and descend the stair,\r\n     With a bald spot in the middle of my hair--\r\n     (They will say: "How his hair is growing thin!")\r\n     My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,\r\n     My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin--\r\n     (They will say: "But how his arms and legs are thin!")\r\n     Do I dare\r\n     Disturb the universe?\r\n     In a minute there is time\r\n     For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.\r\n\r\n     For I have known them all already, known them all:\r\n     Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,\r\n     I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;\r\n     I know the voices dying with a dying fall\r\n     Beneath the music from a farther room.\r\n       So how should I presume?\r\n\r\n     And I have known the eyes already, known them all--\r\n     The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,\r\n     And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,\r\n     When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,\r\n     Then how should I begin\r\n     To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?\r\n       And how should I presume?\r\n\r\n     And I have known the arms already, known them all--\r\n     Arms that are braceleted and white and bare\r\n     (But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)\r\n     Is it perfume from a dress\r\n     That makes me so digress?\r\n     Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.\r\n       And should I then presume?\r\n       And how should I begin?\r\n    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n     Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets\r\n     And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes\r\n     Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?\r\n\r\n     I should have been a pair of ragged claws\r\n     Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.\r\n    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n\r\n     And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so

 Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?\r\n     But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,\r\n     Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,\r\n     I am no prophet--and here\'s no great matter;\r\n     I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,\r\n     And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,\r\n     And in short, I was afraid.\r\n\r\n     And would it have been worth it, after all,\r\n     After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,\r\n     Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,\r\n     Would it have been worth while,\r\n     To have bitten off the matter with a smile,\r\n     To have squeezed the universe into a ball\r\n     To roll it toward some overwhelming question,\r\n     To say: "I am Lazarus, come from the dead,\r\n     Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all"--\r\n     If one, settling a pillow by her head,\r\n       Should say: "That is not what I meant at all;\r\n       That is not it, at all."\r\n\r\n     And would it have been worth it, after all,\r\n     Would it have been worth while,\r\n     After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,\r\n     After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the\r\n         floor--\r\n     And this, and so much more?--\r\n     It is impossible to say just what I mean!\r\n     But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:\r\n     Would it have been worth while\r\n     If one, settling a  pillow or throwing off a shawl,\r\n     And turning toward the window, should say:\r\n       "That is not it at all,\r\n       That is not what I meant, at all."\r\n    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n     No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;\r\n     Am an attendant lord, one that will do\r\n     To swell a progress, start a scene or two,\r\n     Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,\r\n     Deferential, glad to be of use,\r\n     Politic, cautious, and meticulous;\r\n     Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;\r\n     At times, indeed, almost ridiculous--\r\n     Almost, at times, the Fool.\r\n\r\n     I grow old... I grow old...\r\n     I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.\r\n\r\n     Shall I part my hair behind?

you are not blind!\r\n     How keen you are!)\r\n     To find a friend who has these qualities,\r\n     Who has, and gives\r\n     Those qualities upon which friendship lives.\r\n     How much it means that I say this to you--\r\n     Without these friendships--life, what cauchemar!"\r\n     Among the windings of the violins\r\n     And the ariettes\r\n     Of cracked cornets\r\n     Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins\r\n     Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,\r\n     Capricious monotone\r\n     That is at least one definite "false note."\r\n     --Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,\r\n     Admire the monuments\r\n     Discuss the late events,\r\n     Correct our watches by the public clocks.\r\n     Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.\r\n\r\n     II\r\n\r\n     Now that lilacs are in bloom\r\n     She has a bowl of lilacs in her room\r\n     And twists one in her fingers while she talks.\r\n     "Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know\r\n     What life is, you should hold it in your hands";\r\n     (Slowly twisting the lilac stalks)\r\n     "You let it flow from you, you let it flow,\r\n     And youth is cruel, and has no remorse\r\n     And smiles at situations which it cannot see."\r\n     I smile, of course,\r\n     And go on drinking tea.\r\n     "Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall\r\n     My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,\r\n     I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world\r\n     To be wonderful and youthful, after all."\r\n\r\n     The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune\r\n     Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:\r\n     "I am always sure that you understand\r\n     My feelings, always sure that you feel,\r\n     Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.\r\n\r\n     You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles\' heel.\r\n     You will go on, and when you have prevailed\r\n     You can say: at this point many a one has failed.\r\n\r\n     But what have I, but what have I, my friend,\r\n     To give you, what can you receive from me?\r\n     Only the friendship and the sympathy\r\n     Of one about to reach her journey\'s end.\r\n\r\n     I shall sit here, serving tea to friends...."\r\n\r\n     I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends\r\n     For what she has said to me?\r\n     You will see me any morning in the park\r\n     Reading the comics and the sporting page.\r\n     Particularly I remark An English countess goes upon the stage.\r\n     A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,\r\n     Another bank defaulter has confessed.\r\n     I keep my countenance, I remain self-possessed\r\n     Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired\r\n     Reiterates some worn-out common song\r\n     With the smell of hyacinths across the garden\r\n     Recalling things that other people have desired.\r\n     Are these ideas right or wrong?\r\n\r\n     III\r\n\r\n     The October night comes down; returning as before\r\n     Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease\r\n     I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door\r\n     And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.\r\n\r\n     "And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?\r\n     But that\'s a useless question.\r\n     You hardly know when you are coming back,\r\n     You will find so much to learn."\r\n     My smile falls heavily among the bric-\xc3\xa0-brac.\r\n\r\n     "Perhaps you can write to me."\r\n     My self-possession flares up for a second;\r\n     This is as I had reckoned.\r\n\r\n     "I have been wondering frequently of late\r\n     (But our beginnings never know our ends!)\r\n     Why we have not developed into friends."\r\n     I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark\r\n     Suddenly, his expression in a glass.\r\n     My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.\r\n\r\n     "For everybody said so, all our friends,\r\n     They all were sure our feelings would relate\r\n     So closely!

friends."\r\n\r\n     And I must borrow every changing shape\r\n     To find expression... dance, dance\r\n     Like a dancing bear,\r\n     Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.\r\n     Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance--\r\n     Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,\r\n     Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;\r\n     Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand\r\n     With the smoke coming down above the housetops;\r\n     Doubtful, for quite a while\r\n     Not knowing what to feel or if I understand\r\n     Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon...\r\n     Would she not have the advantage, after all?\r\n     This music is successful with a "dying fall"\r\n     Now that we talk of dying--\r\n     And should I have the right to smile?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreludes\r\n\r\n     I\r\n\r\n     The winter evening settles down\r\n     With smell of steaks in passageways.\r\n     Six o\'clock.\r\n     The burnt-out ends of smoky days.\r\n     And now a gusty shower wraps\r\n     The grimy scraps\r\n     Of withered leaves about your feet\r\n     And newspapers from vacant lots;\r\n     The showers beat\r\n     On broken blinds and chimney-pots,\r\n     And at the corner of the street\r\n     A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.\r\n     And then the lighting of the lamps.\r\n\r\n     II\r\n\r\n     The morning comes to consciousness\r\n     Of faint stale smells of beer\r\n     From the sawdust-trampled street\r\n     With all its muddy feet that press\r\n     To early coffee-stands.\r\n\r\n     With the other masquerades\r\n     That time resumes,\r\n     One thinks of all the hands\r\n     That are raising dingy shades\r\n     In a thousand furnished rooms.\r\n\r\n     III\r\n\r\n     You tossed a blanket from the bed,\r\n     You lay upon your back, and waited;\r\n     You dozed, and watched the night revealing\r\n     The thousand sordid images\r\n     Of which your soul was constituted;\r\n     They flickered against the ceiling.\r\n     And when all the world came back\r\n     And the light crept up between the shutters,\r\n     And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,\r\n     You had such a vision of the street\r\n     As the street hardly understands;\r\n     Sitting along the bed\'s edge, where\r\n     You curled the papers from your hair,\r\n     Or clasped the yellow soles of feet\r\n     In the palms of both soiled hands.\r\n\r\n     IV\r\n\r\n     His soul stretched tight across the skies\r\n     That fade behind a city block,\r\n     Or trampled by insistent feet\r\n     At four and five and six o\'clock;\r\n     And short square fingers stuffing pipes,\r\n     And evening newspapers, and eyes\r\n     Assured of certain certainties,\r\n     The conscience of a blackened street\r\n     Impatient to assume the world.\r\n\r\n     I am moved by fancies that are curled\r\n     Around these images, and cling:\r\n     The notion of some infinitely gentle\r\n     Infinitely suffering thing.\r\n\r\n     Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;\r\n     The worlds revolve like ancient women\r\n     Gathering fuel in vacant lots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRhapsody on a Windy Night\r\n\r\n     Twelve o\'clock.\r\n     Along the reaches of the street\r\n     Held in a lunar synthesis,\r\n     Whispering lunar incantations\r\n     Disolve the floors of memory\r\n     And all its clear relations,\r\n     Its divisions and precisions,\r\n     Every street lamp that I pass\r\n     Beats like a fatalistic drum,\r\n     And through the spaces of the dark\r\n     Midnight shakes the memory\r\n     As a madman shakes a dead geranium.\r\n\r\n     Half-past one,\r\n     The street lamp sputtered,\r\n     The street lamp muttered,\r\n     The street lamp said,\r\n     "Regard that woman\r\n     Who hesitates toward you in the light of the door\r\n     Which opens on her like a grin.\r\n     You see the border of her dress\r\n     Is torn and stained with sand,\r\n     And you see the corner of her eye\r\n     Twists like a crooked pin."\r\n\r\n     The memory throws up high and dry\r\n     A crowd of twisted things;\r\n     A twisted branch upon the beach\r\n     Eaten smooth, and polished\r\n     As if the world gave up\r\n     The secret of its skeleton,\r\n     Stiff and white.\r\n     A broken spring in a factory yard,\r\n     Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left\r\n     Hard and curled and ready to snap.\r\n\r\n     Half-past two,\r\n     The street-lamp said,\r\n     "Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,\r\n     Slips out its tongue\r\n     And devours a morsel of rancid butter."\r\n     So the hand of the child, automatic,\r\n     Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along\r\n     the quay.\r\n     I could see nothing behind that child\'s eye.\r\n     I have seen eyes in the street\r\n     Trying to peer through lighted shutters,\r\n     And a crab one afternoon in a pool,\r\n     An old crab with barnacles on his back,\r\n     Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.\r\n\r\n     Half-past three,\r\n     The lamp sputtered,\r\n     The lamp muttered in the dark.\r\n\r\n     The lamp hummed:\r\n     "Regard the moon,\r\n     La lune ne garde aucune rancune,\r\n     She winks a feeble eye,\r\n     She smiles into corners.\r\n     She smooths the hair of the grass.\r\n     The moon has lost her memory.\r\n     A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,\r\n     Her hand twists a paper rose,\r\n     That smells of dust and old Cologne,\r\n     She is alone With all the old nocturnal smells\r\n     That cross and cross across her brain.\r\n     The reminiscence comes\r\n     Of sunless dry geraniums\r\n     And dust in crevices,\r\n     Smells of chestnuts in the streets\r\n     And female smells in shuttered rooms\r\n     And cigarettes in corridors\r\n     And cocktail smells in bars."\r\n\r\n     The lamp said,\r\n     "Four o\'clock,\r\n     Here is the number on the door.\r\n     Memory!\r\n     You have the key,\r\n     The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,\r\n     Mount.\r\n     The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,\r\n     Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life."\r\n\r\n     The last twist of the knife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMorning at the Window\r\n\r\n     They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens,\r\n     And along the trampled edges of the street\r\n     I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids\r\n     Sprouting despondently at area gates.\r\n     The brown waves of fog toss up to me\r\n     Twisted faces from the bottom of the street,\r\n     And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts\r\n     An aimless smile that hovers in the air\r\n     And vanishes along the level of the roofs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boston Evening Transcript\r\n\r\n     The readers of the Boston Evening Transcript\r\n     Sway in the wind like a field of ripe corn.\r\n     When evening quickens faintly in the street,\r\n     Wakening the appetites of life in some\r\n     And to others bringing the Boston Evening Transcript,\r\n     I mount the steps and ring the bell, turning\r\n     Wearily, as one would turn to nod good-bye to Rochefoucauld,\r\n     If the street were time and he at the end of the street,\r\n     And I say, "Cousin Harriet, here is the Boston Evening Transcript."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAunt Helen\r\n\r\n     Miss Helen Slingsby was my maiden aunt,\r\n     And lived in a small house near a fashionable square\r\n     Cared for by servants to the number of four.\r\n     Now when she died there was silence in heaven\r\n     And silence at her end of the street.\r\n     The shutters were drawn and the undertaker wiped his feet--\r\n     He was aware that this sort of thing had occurred before.\r\n     The dogs were handsomely provided for,\r\n     But shortly afterwards the parrot died too.\r\n     The Dresden clock continued ticking on the mantelpiece,\r\n     And the footman sat upon the dining-table\r\n     Holding the second housemaid on his knees--\r\n     Who had always been so careful while her mistress lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCousin Nancy\r\n\r\n     Miss Nancy Ellicott Strode across the hills and broke them,\r\n     Rode across the hills and broke them--\r\n     The barren New England hills--\r\n     Riding to hounds\r\n     Over the cow-pasture.\r\n\r\n     Miss Nancy Ellicott smoked\r\n     And danced all the modern dances;\r\n     And her aunts were not quite sure how they felt about it,\r\n     But they knew that it was modern.\r\n\r\n     Upon the glazen shelves kept watch\r\n     Matthew and Waldo, guardians of the faith,\r\n     The army of unalterable law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Apollinax\r\n\r\n     When Mr. Apollinax visited the United States\r\n     His laughter tinkled among the teacups.\r\n     I thought of Fragilion, that shy figure among the birch-trees,\r\n     And of Priapus in the shrubbery\r\n     Gaping at the lady in the swing.\r\n     In the palace of Mrs. Phlaccus, at Professor Channing-Cheetah\'s\r\n     He laughed like an irresponsible foetus.\r\n     HWith your aid indiffeis laughter was submarine and profound\r\n     Like the old man of the sea\'s\r\n     Hidden under coral islands\r\n     Where worried bodies of drowned men drift down in the green silence,\r\n     Dropping from fingers of surf.\r\n     I looked for the head of Mr. Apollinax rolling under a chair\r\n     Or grinning over a screen\r\n     With seaweed in its hair.\r\n     I heard the beat of centaur\'s hoofs over the hard turf\r\n     As his dry and passionate talk devoured the afternoon.\r\n     "He is a charming man"--"But after all what did he mean?"--\r\n     "His pointed ears... He must be unbalanced,"--\r\n     "There was something he said that I might have challenged."\r\n     Of dowager Mrs. Phlaccus, and Professor and Mrs. Cheetah\r\n     I remember a slice of lemon, and a bitten macaroon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHysteria\r\n\r\n     As she laughed I was aware of becoming involved in her\r\n     laughter and being part of it, until her teeth were\r\n     only accidental stars with a talent for squad-drill. I\r\n     was drawn in by short gasps, inhaled at each momentary\r\n     recovery, lost finally in the dark caverns of her\r\n     throat, bruised by the ripple of unseen muscles. An\r\n     elderly waiter with trembling hands was hurriedly\r\n     spreading a pink and white checked cloth over the rusty\r\n     green iron table, saying: "If the lady and gentleman\r\n     wish to take their tea in the garden, if the lady and\r\n     gentleman wish to take their tea in the garden..." I\r\n     decided that if the shaking of her breasts could be\r\n     stopped, some of the fragments of the afternoon might\r\n     be collected, and I concentrated my attention with\r\n     careful subtlety to this end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConversation Galante\r\n\r\n     I observe: "Our sentimental friend the moon!\r\n     Or possibly (fantastic, I confess)\r\n     It may be Prester John\'s balloon\r\n     Or an old battered lantern hung aloft\r\n     To light poor travellers to their distress."\r\n       She then: "How you digress!"\r\n\r\n     And I then: "Some one frames upon the keys\r\n     That exquisite nocturne, with which we explain\r\n     The night and moonshine; music which we seize\r\n     To body forth our vacuity."\r\n       She then: "Does this refer to me?"\r\n       "Oh no, it is I who am inane."\r\n\r\n     "You, madam, are the eternal humorist,\r\n     The eternal enemy of the absolute,\r\n     Giving our vagrant moods the slightest twist!\r\n     With your air indifferent and imperious\r\n     At a stroke our mad poetics to confute--"\r\n       And--"Are we then so serious?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Figlia Che Piange\r\n\r\n       O quam te memorem Virgo...\r\n\r\n\r\n     Stand on the highest pavement of the stair--\r\n     Lean on a garden urn--\r\n     Weave, weave the sunlight in your hair--\r\n     Clasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise--\r\n     Fling them to the ground and turn\r\n     With a fugitive resentment in your eyes:\r\n     But weave, weave the sunlight in your hair.\r\n\r\n     So I would have had him leave,\r\n     So I would have had her stand and grieve,\r\n     So he would have left\r\n     As the soul leaves the body torn and bruised,\r\n     As the mind deserts the body it has used.\r\n     I should find\r\n     Some way incomparably light and deft,\r\n     Some way we both should understand,\r\n     Simple and faithless as a smile and shake of the hand.\r\n\r\n     She turned away, but with the autumn weather\r\n     Compelled my imagination many days,\r\n     Many days and many hours:\r\n     Her hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers.\r\n     And I wonder how they should have been together!\r\n     I should have lost a gesture and a pose.\r\n     Sometimes these cogitations still amaze\r\n     The troubled midnight and the noon\'s repose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Poems, by T.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
