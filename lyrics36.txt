My hips are ppangppangppang<br>
Boys are like tam tam tam<br>
My lips are nyamnyamnyam<br>
Wherever I go, dangdangdang<br>
Get on stage like jjan jjan jjan<br>
Run, run bangbangbang<br>
Disco, pangpangpang<br>
Hello, bitches<br>
<br>
Where am I?, shopping spree in Tokyo<br>
Wake up in my private jet, every morning Tortilla<br>
Lifting cards in Macau, I am the best<br>
Stop blowing up my phone and won’t you hit me up on Kakao?<br>
Diamonds in my grill and who can stop me? Who?<br>
Skin tone 2-2 karats gold I got in Dubai<br>
My boys won’t hesitate to run up your boys<br>
My boys won’t hesitate to run up your boys<br>
<br>
My hips are ppangppangppang<br>
Boys are like tam tam tam<br>
My lips are nyamnyamnyam<br>
Wherever I go, dangdangdang<br>
Get on stage like jjan jjan jjan<br>
Run, run bangbangbang<br>
Disco, pangpangpang<br>
Hello, bitches<br>
<br>
Yellow gold ain’t it glow like a yellow phone?<br>
Couldn’t see me with a selfie from my telephone<br>
Got hella dough, Hello Kitty getting hella old<br>
Want me to love them long time and I tell 'em no<br>
Sake to suju Nagasaki to Seoul<br>
You can find me in Shanghai<br>
You know what those shots of baijiu do<br>
Got these Asian girls dancing on the couches, yeah, they know me<br>
And they singing every word like they was at the karaoke, huh<br>
<br>
My hips are ppangppangppang<br>
Boys are like tam tam tam<br>
My lips are nyamnyamnyam<br>
Wherever I go, dangdangdang<br>
Get on stage like jjan jjan jjan<br>
Run, run bangbangbang<br>
Disco, pangpangpang<br>
Hello, bitches<br>
<br>
Lights out, killing it some more<br>
Bad bitches get down on the floor<br>
Lights out, killing it some more<br>
Bad bitches get down on the floor<br>
Lights out, killing it some more<br>
Bad bitches get down on the floor<br>
Lights out, killing it some more<br>
Bad bitches get down on the floor<br>
<br>
One, two, three<br>
Bitches!
