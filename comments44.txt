p167
aS'Not a bad movie. Really. And Jackie Chan played a really tragic and \nsympathizable character which was interesting compared to his usual silly \nrole. But still. Calling it "Karate Kid" to market off the original movie \nwhen it\'s instead about Kung Fu? That\'s a little cheap. I might as well \nmake a movie titled "American Football Guy" and have it be about rugby....'
p168

The guy is not exactly Brad Pitt or John Stamos, so people are \nlikely thinking that it would be highly unlikely that a teenage girl would \neven entertain a fantasy in her mind of hooking up with this man.  However, \none would be shocked at how possible such a scenario is.  One of my former \nco-workers told me that this one 57-year-old maintenance man who worked for \nour agency had to go over to a female juvenile detention center to do \nrepairs.  While he was working in a section of the facility where there \nwere teenage female inmates present, this naked girl who was like 14 or 15 \nyears old walked right up to him and started coming on to him.  He was so \nfreaked out by this girl\'s actions that he zapped out of there quickly.  I \nthink he might have even left his toolkit behind.'

p417
aS"They should of make Captain America wear this in the first movie since he \nis in World War 2  like in the comics before wearing that awesome outfit he \ndid in the first moviehttp://\nfeatures.cgsociety.org/gallerycrits/196992/196992_1158203078_large.jpg  \nThen in the second movie and first avengers movie he would wear the one he \nwear in his first movie \nhttp://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131113074751/disney/images/a/a4/CaptainAmerica4-TFA.jpg It \nworld of been better that way but oh well its too late to change the past \nnow :( and i notice in his second movie the winter soldier here shield got \nplastic metal or something they did not use the awesome looking expensive \nshield they use in the first movie that i am glad they use it in the \navengers as well but did not wear his awesome outfit in his first movie!! \nso many things they keep getting wrong at if only i can go back in time to \ntell the people to do it but its too late now! I do wish they took there \ntime on the first movie on making the War scene a lot longer like 2 war \nscene before doing a montage of 2 years of war out of it -_- should of done \nit like like 300 did but they did the montage way too soon so they can get \nthe captain america go to present day already! Cap lasted years in his time \nbefore going to the future present. The new movie how ever was awesome and \ntake there time on the action not making montage out of it could of wish \nthey done that in the first movie oh well!! I was Glad they Use Captain \nAmerica 2011 outfit in the sequel unlike the one that i don't like they use \nin the avengers that was totally cheap looking that came out from a store \nthat close to looking what he wear for show in the first movie glad they \nmake him wear that awesome army suit in the final battle!! fighting Winter \nSoldier and hope he continue wearing that instead unlike the one he wear in \nthe avengers i do like the one he is wearing in age of ultron but really \nthe one he wear in 2011 was so much better looking and makes him look more \nof a soldier like he really is but for some reason i can't scratch the \nfeeling it was missing something like it look a little but different on how \nhe wear it on the first movie much be the guns and that bag he wear in his \noutfit in the entire first movie that was one of the few things are missing \nbeside not using the original expensive shield they use in the first move \neven use it on the avengers but they keep seperating it away from the \noriginal outfit he wear in the first movie and seperating the original \nexpensive looking shield to his original outfit in 2011 like really i keep \nnoticing that anyway and also they could of at least make the german \nsoldiers wear what they wear in the war and not use laser guns seriously i \nknow the Tesseract was the reason why there weapons was advance but \nseriously could of make the movie more realistic like they did to the \nsecond one by making the german use the regular guns in that time and wear \nwhat they wear in the war not making them wear something so cool to make \nthem bad ass looking hell the american army wear what they wear in the \nactual war but you make german wear awesome armor instead of making them \nwear gray outfit and a helmet only! for protection like they actually wear. \nThey could of done better in the first movie like they did to the second \none but they where rushing on the war scene just so they can put cap  \nalready in modern day."

I hated it more than any other film I had ever seen. I saw it \nagain recently and now I love it! I have trouble understanding why they got \nWes Anderson to direct a children's novel like an adult film. I mean the \nprimary audience for this film was kids and I remember me and all my \nfriends hating it and not finding it funny. Very nice surprise for parents \nI imagine thoughz"
