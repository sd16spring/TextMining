aS'People like getting offended nowadays. If Starbucks came with a black cup \nfor Halloween not a single person would say a single thing, even if they \ncome from a country where they don\'t have Halloween, but Christmas, oh that \nhas to do with religion, that\'s an opportunity for "me" to get angry and \npeople would support me.\n\nThat\'s how it works, and it sucks. I\'d love to see Starbucks paint all \ntheir stores red and play freaking Christmas music 24/7 so those guys/girls \ncould STFU.'
